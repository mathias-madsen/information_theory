THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF CHARLES DARWIN

From The Life and Letters of Charles Darwin

By Charles Darwin

Edited by his Son Francis Darwin



[My father's autobiographical recollections, given in the present
chapter, were written for his children,--and written without any
thought that they would ever be published. To many this may seem an
impossibility; but those who knew my father will understand how it was
not only possible, but natural. The autobiography bears the heading,
'Recollections of the Development of my Mind and Character,' and end
with the following note:--"Aug. 3, 1876. This sketch of my life was
begun about May 28th at Hopedene (Mr. Hensleigh Wedgwood's house in
Surrey.), and since then I have written for nearly an hour on most
afternoons." It will easily be understood that, in a narrative of a
personal and intimate kind written for his wife and children, passages
should occur which must here be omitted; and I have not thought it
necessary to indicate where such omissions are made. It has been found
necessary to make a few corrections of obvious verbal slips, but the
number of such alterations has been kept down to the minimum.--F.D.]



A German Editor having written to me for an account of the development
of my mind and character with some sketch of my autobiography, I have
thought that the attempt would amuse me, and might possibly interest
my children or their children. I know that it would have interested me
greatly to have read even so short and dull a sketch of the mind of my
grandfather, written by himself, and what he thought and did, and how he
worked. I have attempted to write the following account of myself, as if
I were a dead man in another world looking back at my own life. Nor have
I found this difficult, for life is nearly over with me. I have taken no
pains about my style of writing.

I was born at Shrewsbury on February 12th, 1809, and my earliest
recollection goes back only to when I was a few months over four years
old, when we went to near Abergele for sea-bathing, and I recollect some
events and places there with some little distinctness.

My mother died in July 1817, when I was a little over eight years old,
and it is odd that I can remember hardly anything about her except
her death-bed, her black velvet gown, and her curiously constructed
work-table. In the spring of this same year I was sent to a day-school
in Shrewsbury, where I stayed a year. I have been told that I was much
slower in learning than my younger sister Catherine, and I believe that
I was in many ways a naughty boy.

By the time I went to this day-school (Kept by Rev. G. Case, minister of
the Unitarian Chapel in the High Street. Mrs. Darwin was a Unitarian
and attended Mr. Case's chapel, and my father as a little boy went there
with his elder sisters. But both he and his brother were christened and
intended to belong to the Church of England; and after his early boyhood
he seems usually to have gone to church and not to Mr. Case's. It
appears ("St. James' Gazette", Dec. 15, 1883) that a mural tablet has
been erected to his memory in the chapel, which is now known as the
'Free Christian Church.') my taste for natural history, and more
especially for collecting, was well developed. I tried to make out
the names of plants (Rev. W.A. Leighton, who was a schoolfellow of my
father's at Mr. Case's school, remembers his bringing a flower to school
and saying that his mother had taught him how by looking at the inside
of the blossom the name of the plant could be discovered. Mr. Leighton
goes on, "This greatly roused my attention and curiosity, and I enquired
of him repeatedly how this could be done?"--but his lesson was naturally
enough not transmissible.--F.D.), and collected all sorts of things,
shells, seals, franks, coins, and minerals. The passion for collecting
which leads a man to be a systematic naturalist, a virtuoso, or a miser,
was very strong in me, and was clearly innate, as none of my sisters or
brother ever had this taste.

One little event during this year has fixed itself very firmly in my
mind, and I hope that it has done so from my conscience having been
afterwards sorely troubled by it; it is curious as showing that
apparently I was interested at this early age in the variability of
plants! I told another little boy (I believe it was Leighton, who
afterwards became a well-known lichenologist and botanist), that I could
produce variously coloured polyanthuses and primroses by watering them
with certain coloured fluids, which was of course a monstrous fable, and
had never been tried by me. I may here also confess that as a little boy
I was much given to inventing deliberate falsehoods, and this was always
done for the sake of causing excitement. For instance, I once gathered
much valuable fruit from my father's trees and hid it in the shrubbery,
and then ran in breathless haste to spread the news that I had
discovered a hoard of stolen fruit.

I must have been a very simple little fellow when I first went to the
school. A boy of the name of Garnett took me into a cake shop one day,
and bought some cakes for which he did not pay, as the shopman trusted
him. When we came out I asked him why he did not pay for them, and he
instantly answered, "Why, do you not know that my uncle left a great
sum of money to the town on condition that every tradesman should give
whatever was wanted without payment to any one who wore his old hat and
moved [it] in a particular manner?" and he then showed me how it was
moved. He then went into another shop where he was trusted, and asked
for some small article, moving his hat in the proper manner, and of
course obtained it without payment. When we came out he said, "Now if
you like to go by yourself into that cake-shop (how well I remember its
exact position) I will lend you my hat, and you can get whatever you
like if you move the hat on your head properly." I gladly accepted the
generous offer, and went in and asked for some cakes, moved the old hat
and was walking out of the shop, when the shopman made a rush at me, so
I dropped the cakes and ran for dear life, and was astonished by being
greeted with shouts of laughter by my false friend Garnett.

I can say in my own favour that I was as a boy humane, but I owed this
entirely to the instruction and example of my sisters. I doubt indeed
whether humanity is a natural or innate quality. I was very fond of
collecting eggs, but I never took more than a single egg out of a bird's
nest, except on one single occasion, when I took all, not for their
value, but from a sort of bravado.

I had a strong taste for angling, and would sit for any number of hours
on the bank of a river or pond watching the float; when at Maer (The
house of his uncle, Josiah Wedgwood.) I was told that I could kill the
worms with salt and water, and from that day I never spitted a living
worm, though at the expense probably of some loss of success.

Once as a very little boy whilst at the day school, or before that time,
I acted cruelly, for I beat a puppy, I believe, simply from enjoying
the sense of power; but the beating could not have been severe, for
the puppy did not howl, of which I feel sure, as the spot was near
the house. This act lay heavily on my conscience, as is shown by my
remembering the exact spot where the crime was committed. It probably
lay all the heavier from my love of dogs being then, and for a long time
afterwards, a passion. Dogs seemed to know this, for I was an adept in
robbing their love from their masters.

I remember clearly only one other incident during this year whilst at
Mr. Case's daily school,--namely, the burial of a dragoon soldier; and
it is surprising how clearly I can still see the horse with the man's
empty boots and carbine suspended to the saddle, and the firing over the
grave. This scene deeply stirred whatever poetic fancy there was in me.

In the summer of 1818 I went to Dr. Butler's great school in Shrewsbury,
and remained there for seven years still Midsummer 1825, when I was
sixteen years old. I boarded at this school, so that I had the great
advantage of living the life of a true schoolboy; but as the distance
was hardly more than a mile to my home, I very often ran there in the
longer intervals between the callings over and before locking up at
night. This, I think, was in many ways advantageous to me by keeping up
home affections and interests. I remember in the early part of my school
life that I often had to run very quickly to be in time, and from being
a fleet runner was generally successful; but when in doubt I prayed
earnestly to God to help me, and I well remember that I attributed my
success to the prayers and not to my quick running, and marvelled how
generally I was aided.

I have heard my father and elder sister say that I had, as a very young
boy, a strong taste for long solitary walks; but what I thought about I
know not. I often became quite absorbed, and once, whilst returning to
school on the summit of the old fortifications round Shrewsbury, which
had been converted into a public foot-path with no parapet on one side,
I walked off and fell to the ground, but the height was only seven or
eight feet. Nevertheless the number of thoughts which passed through my
mind during this very short, but sudden and wholly unexpected fall, was
astonishing, and seem hardly compatible with what physiologists have, I
believe, proved about each thought requiring quite an appreciable amount
of time.

Nothing could have been worse for the development of my mind than
Dr. Butler's school, as it was strictly classical, nothing else being
taught, except a little ancient geography and history. The school as a
means of education to me was simply a blank. During my whole life I have
been singularly incapable of mastering any language. Especial attention
was paid to verse-making, and this I could never do well. I had many
friends, and got together a good collection of old verses, which by
patching together, sometimes aided by other boys, I could work into any
subject. Much attention was paid to learning by heart the lessons of the
previous day; this I could effect with great facility, learning forty or
fifty lines of Virgil or Homer, whilst I was in morning chapel; but
this exercise was utterly useless, for every verse was forgotten
in forty-eight hours. I was not idle, and with the exception of
versification, generally worked conscientiously at my classics, not
using cribs. The sole pleasure I ever received from such studies, was
from some of the odes of Horace, which I admired greatly.

When I left the school I was for my age neither high nor low in it; and
I believe that I was considered by all my masters and by my father as a
very ordinary boy, rather below the common standard in intellect. To my
deep mortification my father once said to me, "You care for nothing but
shooting, dogs, and rat-catching, and you will be a disgrace to yourself
and all your family." But my father, who was the kindest man I ever
knew and whose memory I love with all my heart, must have been angry and
somewhat unjust when he used such words.

Looking back as well as I can at my character during my school life, the
only qualities which at this period promised well for the future,
were, that I had strong and diversified tastes, much zeal for whatever
interested me, and a keen pleasure in understanding any complex subject
or thing. I was taught Euclid by a private tutor, and I distinctly
remember the intense satisfaction which the clear geometrical proofs
gave me. I remember, with equal distinctness, the delight which my uncle
gave me (the father of Francis Galton) by explaining the principle
of the vernier of a barometer with respect to diversified tastes,
independently of science, I was fond of reading various books, and
I used to sit for hours reading the historical plays of Shakespeare,
generally in an old window in the thick walls of the school. I read also
other poetry, such as Thomson's 'Seasons,' and the recently published
poems of Byron and Scott. I mention this because later in life I
wholly lost, to my great regret, all pleasure from poetry of any kind,
including Shakespeare. In connection with pleasure from poetry, I may
add that in 1822 a vivid delight in scenery was first awakened in my
mind, during a riding tour on the borders of Wales, and this has lasted
longer than any other aesthetic pleasure.

Early in my school days a boy had a copy of the 'Wonders of the World,'
which I often read, and disputed with other boys about the veracity of
some of the statements; and I believe that this book first gave me a
wish to travel in remote countries, which was ultimately fulfilled
by the voyage of the "Beagle". In the latter part of my school life
I became passionately fond of shooting; I do not believe that any
one could have shown more zeal for the most holy cause than I did for
shooting birds. How well I remember killing my first snipe, and my
excitement was so great that I had much difficulty in reloading my gun
from the trembling of my hands. This taste long continued, and I became
a very good shot. When at Cambridge I used to practise throwing up my
gun to my shoulder before a looking-glass to see that I threw it up
straight. Another and better plan was to get a friend to wave about a
lighted candle, and then to fire at it with a cap on the nipple, and if
the aim was accurate the little puff of air would blow out the candle.
The explosion of the cap caused a sharp crack, and I was told that the
tutor of the college remarked, "What an extraordinary thing it is, Mr.
Darwin seems to spend hours in cracking a horse-whip in his room, for I
often hear the crack when I pass under his windows."

I had many friends amongst the schoolboys, whom I loved dearly, and I
think that my disposition was then very affectionate.

With respect to science, I continued collecting minerals with much zeal,
but quite unscientifically--all that I cared about was a new-_named_
mineral, and I hardly attempted to classify them. I must have observed
insects with some little care, for when ten years old (1819) I went for
three weeks to Plas Edwards on the sea-coast in Wales, I was very much
interested and surprised at seeing a large black and scarlet Hemipterous
insect, many moths (Zygaena), and a Cicindela which are not found in
Shropshire. I almost made up my mind to begin collecting all the insects
which I could find dead, for on consulting my sister I concluded that it
was not right to kill insects for the sake of making a collection. From
reading White's 'Selborne,' I took much pleasure in watching the
habits of birds, and even made notes on the subject. In my simplicity I
remember wondering why every gentleman did not become an ornithologist.

Towards the close of my school life, my brother worked hard at
chemistry, and made a fair laboratory with proper apparatus in the
tool-house in the garden, and I was allowed to aid him as a servant in
most of his experiments. He made all the gases and many compounds, and
I read with great care several books on chemistry, such as Henry and
Parkes' 'Chemical Catechism.' The subject interested me greatly, and we
often used to go on working till rather late at night. This was the best
part of my education at school, for it showed me practically the meaning
of experimental science. The fact that we worked at chemistry somehow
got known at school, and as it was an unprecedented fact, I was
nicknamed "Gas." I was also once publicly rebuked by the head-master,
Dr. Butler, for thus wasting my time on such useless subjects; and he
called me very unjustly a "poco curante," and as I did not understand
what he meant, it seemed to me a fearful reproach.

As I was doing no good at school, my father wisely took me away at a
rather earlier age than usual, and sent me (Oct. 1825) to Edinburgh
University with my brother, where I stayed for two years or sessions. My
brother was completing his medical studies, though I do not believe he
ever really intended to practise, and I was sent there to commence
them. But soon after this period I became convinced from various small
circumstances that my father would leave me property enough to subsist
on with some comfort, though I never imagined that I should be so rich a
man as I am; but my belief was sufficient to check any strenuous efforts
to learn medicine.

The instruction at Edinburgh was altogether by lectures, and these were
intolerably dull, with the exception of those on chemistry by Hope; but
to my mind there are no advantages and many disadvantages in lectures
compared with reading. Dr. Duncan's lectures on Materia Medica at 8
o'clock on a winter's morning are something fearful to remember. Dr.----
made his lectures on human anatomy as dull as he was himself, and the
subject disgusted me. It has proved one of the greatest evils in my life
that I was not urged to practise dissection, for I should soon have got
over my disgust; and the practice would have been invaluable for all
my future work. This has been an irremediable evil, as well as my
incapacity to draw. I also attended regularly the clinical wards in the
hospital. Some of the cases distressed me a good deal, and I still have
vivid pictures before me of some of them; but I was not so foolish as to
allow this to lessen my attendance. I cannot understand why this part
of my medical course did not interest me in a greater degree; for during
the summer before coming to Edinburgh I began attending some of the poor
people, chiefly children and women in Shrewsbury: I wrote down as full
an account as I could of the case with all the symptoms, and read them
aloud to my father, who suggested further inquiries and advised me what
medicines to give, which I made up myself. At one time I had at least a
dozen patients, and I felt a keen interest in the work. My father, who
was by far the best judge of character whom I ever knew, declared that
I should make a successful physician,--meaning by this one who would
get many patients. He maintained that the chief element of success was
exciting confidence; but what he saw in me which convinced him that I
should create confidence I know not. I also attended on two occasions
the operating theatre in the hospital at Edinburgh, and saw two very
bad operations, one on a child, but I rushed away before they were
completed. Nor did I ever attend again, for hardly any inducement would
have been strong enough to make me do so; this being long before the
blessed days of chloroform. The two cases fairly haunted me for many a
long year.

My brother stayed only one year at the University, so that during the
second year I was left to my own resources; and this was an advantage,
for I became well acquainted with several young men fond of natural
science. One of these was Ainsworth, who afterwards published his
travels in Assyria; he was a Wernerian geologist, and knew a little
about many subjects. Dr. Coldstream was a very different young man,
prim, formal, highly religious, and most kind-hearted; he afterwards
published some good zoological articles. A third young man was Hardie,
who would, I think, have made a good botanist, but died early in
India. Lastly, Dr. Grant, my senior by several years, but how I became
acquainted with him I cannot remember; he published some first-rate
zoological papers, but after coming to London as Professor in University
College, he did nothing more in science, a fact which has always been
inexplicable to me. I knew him well; he was dry and formal in manner,
with much enthusiasm beneath this outer crust. He one day, when we were
walking together, burst forth in high admiration of Lamarck and his
views on evolution. I listened in silent astonishment, and as far as
I can judge without any effect on my mind. I had previously read the
'Zoonomia' of my grandfather, in which similar views are maintained, but
without producing any effect on me. Nevertheless it is probable that the
hearing rather early in life such views maintained and praised may
have favoured my upholding them under a different form in my 'Origin of
Species.' At this time I admired greatly the 'Zoonomia;' but on reading
it a second time after an interval of ten or fifteen years, I was much
disappointed; the proportion of speculation being so large to the facts
given.

Drs. Grant and Coldstream attended much to marine Zoology, and I often
accompanied the former to collect animals in the tidal pools, which I
dissected as well as I could. I also became friends with some of the
Newhaven fishermen, and sometimes accompanied them when they trawled
for oysters, and thus got many specimens. But from not having had any
regular practice in dissection, and from possessing only a wretched
microscope, my attempts were very poor. Nevertheless I made one
interesting little discovery, and read, about the beginning of the year
1826, a short paper on the subject before the Plinian Society. This was
that the so-called ova of Flustra had the power of independent movement
by means of cilia, and were in fact larvae. In another short paper I
showed that the little globular bodies which had been supposed to be
the young state of Fucus loreus were the egg-cases of the wormlike
Pontobdella muricata.

The Plinian Society was encouraged and, I believe, founded by Professor
Jameson: it consisted of students and met in an underground room in
the University for the sake of reading papers on natural science and
discussing them. I used regularly to attend, and the meetings had a
good effect on me in stimulating my zeal and giving me new congenial
acquaintances. One evening a poor young man got up, and after stammering
for a prodigious length of time, blushing crimson, he at last slowly
got out the words, "Mr. President, I have forgotten what I was going to
say." The poor fellow looked quite overwhelmed, and all the members
were so surprised that no one could think of a word to say to cover his
confusion. The papers which were read to our little society were not
printed, so that I had not the satisfaction of seeing my paper in print;
but I believe Dr. Grant noticed my small discovery in his excellent
memoir on Flustra.

I was also a member of the Royal Medical Society, and attended pretty
regularly; but as the subjects were exclusively medical, I did not much
care about them. Much rubbish was talked there, but there were some good
speakers, of whom the best was the present Sir J. Kay-Shuttleworth. Dr.
Grant took me occasionally to the meetings of the Wernerian Society,
where various papers on natural history were read, discussed, and
afterwards published in the 'Transactions.' I heard Audubon deliver
there some interesting discourses on the habits of N. American birds,
sneering somewhat unjustly at Waterton. By the way, a negro lived in
Edinburgh, who had travelled with Waterton, and gained his livelihood
by stuffing birds, which he did excellently: he gave me lessons for
payment, and I used often to sit with him, for he was a very pleasant
and intelligent man.

Mr. Leonard Horner also took me once to a meeting of the Royal Society
of Edinburgh, where I saw Sir Walter Scott in the chair as President,
and he apologised to the meeting as not feeling fitted for such a
position. I looked at him and at the whole scene with some awe and
reverence, and I think it was owing to this visit during my youth, and
to my having attended the Royal Medical Society, that I felt the honour
of being elected a few years ago an honorary member of both these
Societies, more than any other similar honour. If I had been told at
that time that I should one day have been thus honoured, I declare that
I should have thought it as ridiculous and improbable, as if I had been
told that I should be elected King of England.

During my second year at Edinburgh I attended ----'s lectures on
Geology and Zoology, but they were incredibly dull. The sole effect they
produced on me was the determination never as long as I lived to read
a book on Geology, or in any way to study the science. Yet I feel sure
that I was prepared for a philosophical treatment of the subject; for
an old Mr. Cotton in Shropshire, who knew a good deal about rocks,
had pointed out to me two or three years previously a well-known large
erratic boulder in the town of Shrewsbury, called the "bell-stone"; he
told me that there was no rock of the same kind nearer than Cumberland
or Scotland, and he solemnly assured me that the world would come to an
end before any one would be able to explain how this stone came where
it now lay. This produced a deep impression on me, and I meditated over
this wonderful stone. So that I felt the keenest delight when I first
read of the action of icebergs in transporting boulders, and I gloried
in the progress of Geology. Equally striking is the fact that I, though
now only sixty-seven years old, heard the Professor, in a field lecture
at Salisbury Craigs, discoursing on a trapdyke, with amygdaloidal
margins and the strata indurated on each side, with volcanic rocks all
around us, say that it was a fissure filled with sediment from above,
adding with a sneer that there were men who maintained that it had
been injected from beneath in a molten condition. When I think of this
lecture, I do not wonder that I determined never to attend to Geology.

From attending ----'s lectures, I became acquainted with the curator
of the museum, Mr. Macgillivray, who afterwards published a large
and excellent book on the birds of Scotland. I had much interesting
natural-history talk with him, and he was very kind to me. He gave me
some rare shells, for I at that time collected marine mollusca, but with
no great zeal.

My summer vacations during these two years were wholly given up to
amusements, though I always had some book in hand, which I read with
interest. During the summer of 1826 I took a long walking tour with
two friends with knapsacks on our backs through North wales. We walked
thirty miles most days, including one day the ascent of Snowdon. I
also went with my sister a riding tour in North Wales, a servant with
saddle-bags carrying our clothes. The autumns were devoted to shooting
chiefly at Mr. Owen's, at Woodhouse, and at my Uncle Jos's (Josiah
Wedgwood, the son of the founder of the Etruria Works.) at Maer. My zeal
was so great that I used to place my shooting-boots open by my bed-side
when I went to bed, so as not to lose half a minute in putting them on
in the morning; and on one occasion I reached a distant part of the Maer
estate, on the 20th of August for black-game shooting, before I could
see: I then toiled on with the game-keeper the whole day through thick
heath and young Scotch firs.

I kept an exact record of every bird which I shot throughout the whole
season. One day when shooting at Woodhouse with Captain Owen, the eldest
son, and Major Hill, his cousin, afterwards Lord Berwick, both of whom I
liked very much, I thought myself shamefully used, for every time after
I had fired and thought that I had killed a bird, one of the two acted
as if loading his gun, and cried out, "You must not count that bird,
for I fired at the same time," and the gamekeeper, perceiving the joke,
backed them up. After some hours they told me the joke, but it was no
joke to me, for I had shot a large number of birds, but did not know how
many, and could not add them to my list, which I used to do by making a
knot in a piece of string tied to a button-hole. This my wicked friends
had perceived.

How I did enjoy shooting! But I think that I must have been
half-consciously ashamed of my zeal, for I tried to persuade myself
that shooting was almost an intellectual employment; it required so much
skill to judge where to find most game and to hunt the dogs well.

One of my autumnal visits to Maer in 1827 was memorable from meeting
there Sir J. Mackintosh, who was the best converser I ever listened
to. I heard afterwards with a glow of pride that he had said, "There
is something in that young man that interests me." This must have been
chiefly due to his perceiving that I listened with much interest to
everything which he said, for I was as ignorant as a pig about his
subjects of history, politics, and moral philosophy. To hear of praise
from an eminent person, though no doubt apt or certain to excite vanity,
is, I think, good for a young man, as it helps to keep him in the right
course.

My visits to Maer during these two or three succeeding years were quite
delightful, independently of the autumnal shooting. Life there was
perfectly free; the country was very pleasant for walking or riding;
and in the evening there was much very agreeable conversation, not
so personal as it generally is in large family parties, together with
music. In the summer the whole family used often to sit on the steps
of the old portico, with the flower-garden in front, and with the steep
wooded bank opposite the house reflected in the lake, with here and
there a fish rising or a water-bird paddling about. Nothing has left a
more vivid picture on my mind than these evenings at Maer. I was
also attached to and greatly revered my Uncle Jos; he was silent and
reserved, so as to be a rather awful man; but he sometimes talked openly
with me. He was the very type of an upright man, with the clearest
judgment. I do not believe that any power on earth could have made him
swerve an inch from what he considered the right course. I used to apply
to him in my mind the well-known ode of Horace, now forgotten by me, in
which the words "nec vultus tyranni, etc.," come in.

     (Justum et tenacem propositi virum
     Non civium ardor prava jubentium
     Non vultus instantis tyranni
     Mente quatit solida.)




CAMBRIDGE 1828-1831.

After having spent two sessions in Edinburgh, my father perceived, or
he heard from my sisters, that I did not like the thought of being a
physician, so he proposed that I should become a clergyman. He was very
properly vehement against my turning into an idle sporting man, which
then seemed my probable destination. I asked for some time to consider,
as from what little I had heard or thought on the subject I had scruples
about declaring my belief in all the dogmas of the Church of England;
though otherwise I liked the thought of being a country clergyman.
Accordingly I read with care 'Pearson on the Creed,' and a few other
books on divinity; and as I did not then in the least doubt the strict
and literal truth of every word in the Bible, I soon persuaded myself
that our Creed must be fully accepted.

Considering how fiercely I have been attacked by the orthodox, it seems
ludicrous that I once intended to be a clergyman. Nor was this intention
and my father's wish ever formerly given up, but died a natural death
when, on leaving Cambridge, I joined the "Beagle" as naturalist. If the
phrenologists are to be trusted, I was well fitted in one respect to be
a clergyman. A few years ago the secretaries of a German psychological
society asked me earnestly by letter for a photograph of myself; and
some time afterwards I received the proceedings of one of the meetings,
in which it seemed that the shape of my head had been the subject of a
public discussion, and one of the speakers declared that I had the bump
of reverence developed enough for ten priests.

As it was decided that I should be a clergyman, it was necessary that I
should go to one of the English universities and take a degree; but as
I had never opened a classical book since leaving school, I found to
my dismay, that in the two intervening years I had actually forgotten,
incredible as it may appear, almost everything which I had learnt,
even to some few of the Greek letters. I did not therefore proceed to
Cambridge at the usual time in October, but worked with a private tutor
in Shrewsbury, and went to Cambridge after the Christmas vacation, early
in 1828. I soon recovered my school standard of knowledge, and could
translate easy Greek books, such as Homer and the Greek Testament, with
moderate facility.

During the three years which I spent at Cambridge my time was wasted,
as far as the academical studies were concerned, as completely as at
Edinburgh and at school. I attempted mathematics, and even went during
the summer of 1828 with a private tutor (a very dull man) to Barmouth,
but I got on very slowly. The work was repugnant to me, chiefly from my
not being able to see any meaning in the early steps in algebra. This
impatience was very foolish, and in after years I have deeply regretted
that I did not proceed far enough at least to understand something of
the great leading principles of mathematics, for men thus endowed seem
to have an extra sense. But I do not believe that I should ever have
succeeded beyond a very low grade. With respect to Classics I did
nothing except attend a few compulsory college lectures, and the
attendance was almost nominal. In my second year I had to work for a
month or two to pass the Little-Go, which I did easily. Again, in my
last year I worked with some earnestness for my final degree of B.A.,
and brushed up my Classics, together with a little Algebra and Euclid,
which latter gave me much pleasure, as it did at school. In order to
pass the B.A. examination, it was also necessary to get up Paley's
'Evidences of Christianity,' and his 'Moral Philosophy.' This was done
in a thorough manner, and I am convinced that I could have written out
the whole of the 'Evidences' with perfect correctness, but not of course
in the clear language of Paley. The logic of this book and, as I may
add, of his 'Natural Theology,' gave me as much delight as did Euclid.
The careful study of these works, without attempting to learn any part
by rote, was the only part of the academical course which, as I then
felt and as I still believe, was of the least use to me in the education
of my mind. I did not at that time trouble myself about Paley's
premises; and taking these on trust, I was charmed and convinced by the
long line of argumentation. By answering well the examination questions
in Paley, by doing Euclid well, and by not failing miserably in
Classics, I gained a good place among the oi polloi or crowd of men who
do not go in for honours. Oddly enough, I cannot remember how high I
stood, and my memory fluctuates between the fifth, tenth, or twelfth,
name on the list. (Tenth in the list of January 1831.)

Public lectures on several branches were given in the University,
attendance being quite voluntary; but I was so sickened with lectures at
Edinburgh that I did not even attend Sedgwick's eloquent and interesting
lectures. Had I done so I should probably have become a geologist
earlier than I did. I attended, however, Henslow's lectures on Botany,
and liked them much for their extreme clearness, and the admirable
illustrations; but I did not study botany. Henslow used to take his
pupils, including several of the older members of the University, field
excursions, on foot or in coaches, to distant places, or in a barge
down the river, and lectured on the rarer plants and animals which were
observed. These excursions were delightful.

Although, as we shall presently see, there were some redeeming features
in my life at Cambridge, my time was sadly wasted there, and worse than
wasted. From my passion for shooting and for hunting, and, when this
failed, for riding across country, I got into a sporting set, including
some dissipated low-minded young men. We used often to dine together in
the evening, though these dinners often included men of a higher stamp,
and we sometimes drank too much, with jolly singing and playing at cards
afterwards. I know that I ought to feel ashamed of days and evenings
thus spent, but as some of my friends were very pleasant, and we were
all in the highest spirits, I cannot help looking back to these times
with much pleasure.

But I am glad to think that I had many other friends of a widely
different nature. I was very intimate with Whitley (Rev. C. Whitley,
Hon. Canon of Durham, formerly Reader in Natural Philosophy in
Durham University.), who was afterwards Senior Wrangler, and we used
continually to take long walks together. He inoculated me with a taste
for pictures and good engravings, of which I bought some. I frequently
went to the Fitzwilliam Gallery, and my taste must have been fairly
good, for I certainly admired the best pictures, which I discussed with
the old curator. I read also with much interest Sir Joshua Reynolds'
book. This taste, though not natural to me, lasted for several years,
and many of the pictures in the National Gallery in London gave me
much pleasure; that of Sebastian del Piombo exciting in me a sense of
sublimity.

I also got into a musical set, I believe by means of my warm-hearted
friend, Herbert (The late John Maurice Herbert, County Court Judge of
Cardiff and the Monmouth Circuit.), who took a high wrangler's degree.
From associating with these men, and hearing them play, I acquired a
strong taste for music, and used very often to time my walks so as to
hear on week days the anthem in King's College Chapel. This gave me
intense pleasure, so that my backbone would sometimes shiver. I am sure
that there was no affectation or mere imitation in this taste, for I
used generally to go by myself to King's College, and I sometimes hired
the chorister boys to sing in my rooms. Nevertheless I am so utterly
destitute of an ear, that I cannot perceive a discord, or keep time
and hum a tune correctly; and it is a mystery how I could possibly have
derived pleasure from music.

My musical friends soon perceived my state, and sometimes amused
themselves by making me pass an examination, which consisted in
ascertaining how many tunes I could recognise when they were played
rather more quickly or slowly than usual. 'God save the King,' when thus
played, was a sore puzzle. There was another man with almost as bad an
ear as I had, and strange to say he played a little on the flute. Once I
had the triumph of beating him in one of our musical examinations.

But no pursuit at Cambridge was followed with nearly so much eagerness
or gave me so much pleasure as collecting beetles. It was the mere
passion for collecting, for I did not dissect them, and rarely compared
their external characters with published descriptions, but got them
named anyhow. I will give a proof of my zeal: one day, on tearing off
some old bark, I saw two rare beetles, and seized one in each hand; then
I saw a third and new kind, which I could not bear to lose, so that I
popped the one which I held in my right hand into my mouth. Alas! it
ejected some intensely acrid fluid, which burnt my tongue so that I was
forced to spit the beetle out, which was lost, as was the third one.

I was very successful in collecting, and invented two new methods; I
employed a labourer to scrape during the winter, moss off old trees
and place it in a large bag, and likewise to collect the rubbish at the
bottom of the barges in which reeds are brought from the fens, and thus
I got some very rare species. No poet ever felt more delighted at
seeing his first poem published than I did at seeing, in Stephens'
'Illustrations of British Insects,' the magic words, "captured by C.
Darwin, Esq." I was introduced to entomology by my second cousin W.
Darwin Fox, a clever and most pleasant man, who was then at Christ's
College, and with whom I became extremely intimate. Afterwards I became
well acquainted, and went out collecting, with Albert Way of Trinity,
who in after years became a well-known archaeologist; also with H.
Thompson of the same College, afterwards a leading agriculturist,
chairman of a great railway, and Member of Parliament. It seems
therefore that a taste for collecting beetles is some indication of
future success in life!

I am surprised what an indelible impression many of the beetles which
I caught at Cambridge have left on my mind. I can remember the exact
appearance of certain posts, old trees and banks where I made a good
capture. The pretty Panagaeus crux-major was a treasure in those days,
and here at Down I saw a beetle running across a walk, and on picking it
up instantly perceived that it differed slightly from P. crux-major,
and it turned out to be P. quadripunctatus, which is only a variety or
closely allied species, differing from it very slightly in outline. I
had never seen in those old days Licinus alive, which to an uneducated
eye hardly differs from many of the black Carabidous beetles; but my
sons found here a specimen, and I instantly recognised that it was new
to me; yet I had not looked at a British beetle for the last twenty
years.

I have not as yet mentioned a circumstance which influenced my whole
career more than any other. This was my friendship with Professor
Henslow. Before coming up to Cambridge, I had heard of him from my
brother as a man who knew every branch of science, and I was accordingly
prepared to reverence him. He kept open house once every week when
all undergraduates, and some older members of the University, who were
attached to science, used to meet in the evening. I soon got, through
Fox, an invitation, and went there regularly. Before long I became
well acquainted with Henslow, and during the latter half of my time at
Cambridge took long walks with him on most days; so that I was called by
some of the dons "the man who walks with Henslow;" and in the evening I
was very often asked to join his family dinner. His knowledge was great
in botany, entomology, chemistry, mineralogy, and geology. His strongest
taste was to draw conclusions from long-continued minute observations.
His judgment was excellent, and his whole mind well balanced; but I
do not suppose that any one would say that he possessed much original
genius. He was deeply religious, and so orthodox that he told me one day
he should be grieved if a single word of the Thirty-nine Articles were
altered. His moral qualities were in every way admirable. He was free
from every tinge of vanity or other petty feeling; and I never saw a man
who thought so little about himself or his own concerns. His temper was
imperturbably good, with the most winning and courteous manners; yet,
as I have seen, he could be roused by any bad action to the warmest
indignation and prompt action.

I once saw in his company in the streets of Cambridge almost as horrid
a scene as could have been witnessed during the French Revolution. Two
body-snatchers had been arrested, and whilst being taken to prison had
been torn from the constable by a crowd of the roughest men, who dragged
them by their legs along the muddy and stony road. They were covered
from head to foot with mud, and their faces were bleeding either from
having been kicked or from the stones; they looked like corpses, but
the crowd was so dense that I got only a few momentary glimpses of the
wretched creatures. Never in my life have I seen such wrath painted on
a man's face as was shown by Henslow at this horrid scene. He tried
repeatedly to penetrate the mob; but it was simply impossible. He then
rushed away to the mayor, telling me not to follow him, but to get more
policemen. I forget the issue, except that the two men were got into the
prison without being killed.

Henslow's benevolence was unbounded, as he proved by his many excellent
schemes for his poor parishioners, when in after years he held the
living of Hitcham. My intimacy with such a man ought to have been, and I
hope was, an inestimable benefit. I cannot resist mentioning a trifling
incident, which showed his kind consideration. Whilst examining some
pollen-grains on a damp surface, I saw the tubes exserted, and instantly
rushed off to communicate my surprising discovery to him. Now I do not
suppose any other professor of botany could have helped laughing at my
coming in such a hurry to make such a communication. But he agreed how
interesting the phenomenon was, and explained its meaning, but made me
clearly understand how well it was known; so I left him not in the
least mortified, but well pleased at having discovered for myself so
remarkable a fact, but determined not to be in such a hurry again to
communicate my discoveries.

Dr. Whewell was one of the older and distinguished men who sometimes
visited Henslow, and on several occasions I walked home with him at
night. Next to Sir J. Mackintosh he was the best converser on grave
subjects to whom I ever listened. Leonard Jenyns (The well-known Soame
Jenyns was cousin to Mr. Jenyns' father.), who afterwards published some
good essays in Natural History (Mr. Jenyns (now Blomefield) described
the fish for the Zoology of the "Beagle"; and is author of a long series
of papers, chiefly Zoological.), often stayed with Henslow, who was his
brother-in-law. I visited him at his parsonage on the borders of the
Fens [Swaffham Bulbeck], and had many a good walk and talk with him
about Natural History. I became also acquainted with several other men
older than me, who did not care much about science, but were friends of
Henslow. One was a Scotchman, brother of Sir Alexander Ramsay, and tutor
of Jesus College: he was a delightful man, but did not live for many
years. Another was Mr. Dawes, afterwards Dean of Hereford, and famous
for his success in the education of the poor. These men and others of
the same standing, together with Henslow, used sometimes to take distant
excursions into the country, which I was allowed to join, and they were
most agreeable.

Looking back, I infer that there must have been something in me a little
superior to the common run of youths, otherwise the above-mentioned men,
so much older than me and higher in academical position, would never
have allowed me to associate with them. Certainly I was not aware of any
such superiority, and I remember one of my sporting friends, Turner,
who saw me at work with my beetles, saying that I should some day be a
Fellow of the Royal Society, and the notion seemed to me preposterous.

During my last year at Cambridge, I read with care and profound interest
Humboldt's 'Personal Narrative.' This work, and Sir J. Herschel's
'Introduction to the Study of Natural Philosophy,' stirred up in me
a burning zeal to add even the most humble contribution to the noble
structure of Natural Science. No one or a dozen other books influenced
me nearly so much as these two. I copied out from Humboldt long passages
about Teneriffe, and read them aloud on one of the above-mentioned
excursions, to (I think) Henslow, Ramsay, and Dawes, for on a previous
occasion I had talked about the glories of Teneriffe, and some of the
party declared they would endeavour to go there; but I think that they
were only half in earnest. I was, however, quite in earnest, and got
an introduction to a merchant in London to enquire about ships; but
the scheme was, of course, knocked on the head by the voyage of the
"Beagle".

My summer vacations were given up to collecting beetles, to some
reading, and short tours. In the autumn my whole time was devoted to
shooting, chiefly at Woodhouse and Maer, and sometimes with young Eyton
of Eyton. Upon the whole the three years which I spent at Cambridge were
the most joyful in my happy life; for I was then in excellent health,
and almost always in high spirits.

As I had at first come up to Cambridge at Christmas, I was forced to
keep two terms after passing my final examination, at the commencement
of 1831; and Henslow then persuaded me to begin the study of geology.
Therefore on my return to Shropshire I examined sections, and coloured
a map of parts round Shrewsbury. Professor Sedgwick intended to visit
North Wales in the beginning of August to pursue his famous geological
investigations amongst the older rocks, and Henslow asked him to allow
me to accompany him. (In connection with this tour my father used
to tell a story about Sedgwick: they had started from their inn one
morning, and had walked a mile or two, when Sedgwick suddenly stopped,
and vowed that he would return, being certain "that damned scoundrel"
(the waiter) had not given the chambermaid the sixpence intrusted to
him for the purpose. He was ultimately persuaded to give up the project,
seeing that there was no reason for suspecting the waiter of especial
perfidy.--F.D.) Accordingly he came and slept at my father's house.

A short conversation with him during this evening produced a strong
impression on my mind. Whilst examining an old gravel-pit near
Shrewsbury, a labourer told me that he had found in it a large worn
tropical Volute shell, such as may be seen on the chimney-pieces of
cottages; and as he would not sell the shell, I was convinced that he
had really found it in the pit. I told Sedgwick of the fact, and he at
once said (no doubt truly) that it must have been thrown away by some
one into the pit; but then added, if really embedded there it would be
the greatest misfortune to geology, as it would overthrow all that
we know about the superficial deposits of the Midland Counties. These
gravel-beds belong in fact to the glacial period, and in after years I
found in them broken arctic shells. But I was then utterly astonished at
Sedgwick not being delighted at so wonderful a fact as a tropical shell
being found near the surface in the middle of England. Nothing
before had ever made me thoroughly realise, though I had read various
scientific books, that science consists in grouping facts so that
general laws or conclusions may be drawn from them.

Next morning we started for Llangollen, Conway, Bangor, and Capel Curig.
This tour was of decided use in teaching me a little how to make out the
geology of a country. Sedgwick often sent me on a line parallel to
his, telling me to bring back specimens of the rocks and to mark the
stratification on a map. I have little doubt that he did this for my
good, as I was too ignorant to have aided him. On this tour I had a
striking instance of how easy it is to overlook phenomena, however
conspicuous, before they have been observed by any one. We spent many
hours in Cwm Idwal, examining all the rocks with extreme care, as
Sedgwick was anxious to find fossils in them; but neither of us saw
a trace of the wonderful glacial phenomena all around us; we did not
notice the plainly scored rocks, the perched boulders, the lateral and
terminal moraines. Yet these phenomena are so conspicuous that, as
I declared in a paper published many years afterwards in the
'Philosophical Magazine' ('Philosophical Magazine,' 1842.), a house
burnt down by fire did not tell its story more plainly than did this
valley. If it had still been filled by a glacier, the phenomena would
have been less distinct than they now are.

At Capel Curig I left Sedgwick and went in a straight line by compass
and map across the mountains to Barmouth, never following any track
unless it coincided with my course. I thus came on some strange wild
places, and enjoyed much this manner of travelling. I visited Barmouth
to see some Cambridge friends who were reading there, and thence
returned to Shrewsbury and to Maer for shooting; for at that time
I should have thought myself mad to give up the first days of
partridge-shooting for geology or any other science.




"VOYAGE OF THE 'BEAGLE' FROM DECEMBER 27, 1831, TO OCTOBER 2, 1836."

On returning home from my short geological tour in North Wales, I found
a letter from Henslow, informing me that Captain Fitz-Roy was willing to
give up part of his own cabin to any young man who would volunteer to go
with him without pay as naturalist to the Voyage of the "Beagle". I
have given, as I believe, in my MS. Journal an account of all the
circumstances which then occurred; I will here only say that I was
instantly eager to accept the offer, but my father strongly objected,
adding the words, fortunate for me, "If you can find any man of common
sense who advises you to go I will give my consent." So I wrote that
evening and refused the offer. On the next morning I went to Maer to
be ready for September 1st, and, whilst out shooting, my uncle (Josiah
Wedgwood.) sent for me, offering to drive me over to Shrewsbury and talk
with my father, as my uncle thought it would be wise in me to accept the
offer. My father always maintained that he was one of the most sensible
men in the world, and he at once consented in the kindest manner. I had
been rather extravagant at Cambridge, and to console my father, said,
"that I should be deuced clever to spend more than my allowance whilst
on board the 'Beagle';" but he answered with a smile, "But they tell me
you are very clever."

Next day I started for Cambridge to see Henslow, and thence to London
to see Fitz-Roy, and all was soon arranged. Afterwards, on becoming very
intimate with Fitz-Roy, I heard that I had run a very narrow risk of
being rejected, on account of the shape of my nose! He was an ardent
disciple of Lavater, and was convinced that he could judge of a man's
character by the outline of his features; and he doubted whether any one
with my nose could possess sufficient energy and determination for the
voyage. But I think he was afterwards well satisfied that my nose had
spoken falsely.

Fitz-Roy's character was a singular one, with very many noble features:
he was devoted to his duty, generous to a fault, bold, determined, and
indomitably energetic, and an ardent friend to all under his sway. He
would undertake any sort of trouble to assist those whom he thought
deserved assistance. He was a handsome man, strikingly like a gentleman,
with highly courteous manners, which resembled those of his maternal
uncle, the famous Lord Castlereagh, as I was told by the Minister at
Rio. Nevertheless he must have inherited much in his appearance from
Charles II., for Dr. Wallich gave me a collection of photographs which
he had made, and I was struck with the resemblance of one to Fitz-Roy;
and on looking at the name, I found it Ch. E. Sobieski Stuart, Count
d'Albanie, a descendant of the same monarch.

Fitz-Roy's temper was a most unfortunate one. It was usually worst in
the early morning, and with his eagle eye he could generally detect
something amiss about the ship, and was then unsparing in his blame. He
was very kind to me, but was a man very difficult to live with on the
intimate terms which necessarily followed from our messing by ourselves
in the same cabin. We had several quarrels; for instance, early in the
voyage at Bahia, in Brazil, he defended and praised slavery, which I
abominated, and told me that he had just visited a great slave-owner,
who had called up many of his slaves and asked them whether they were
happy, and whether they wished to be free, and all answered "No." I then
asked him, perhaps with a sneer, whether he thought that the answer of
slaves in the presence of their master was worth anything? This made him
excessively angry, and he said that as I doubted his word we could not
live any longer together. I thought that I should have been compelled to
leave the ship; but as soon as the news spread, which it did quickly,
as the captain sent for the first lieutenant to assuage his anger by
abusing me, I was deeply gratified by receiving an invitation from all
the gun-room officers to mess with them. But after a few hours Fitz-Roy
showed his usual magnanimity by sending an officer to me with an apology
and a request that I would continue to live with him.

His character was in several respects one of the most noble which I have
ever known.

The voyage of the "Beagle" has been by far the most important event in
my life, and has determined my whole career; yet it depended on so
small a circumstance as my uncle offering to drive me thirty miles to
Shrewsbury, which few uncles would have done, and on such a trifle as
the shape of my nose. I have always felt that I owe to the voyage the
first real training or education of my mind; I was led to attend
closely to several branches of natural history, and thus my powers of
observation were improved, though they were always fairly developed.

The investigation of the geology of all the places visited was far more
important, as reasoning here comes into play. On first examining a new
district nothing can appear more hopeless than the chaos of rocks; but
by recording the stratification and nature of the rocks and fossils
at many points, always reasoning and predicting what will be found
elsewhere, light soon begins to dawn on the district, and the structure
of the whole becomes more or less intelligible. I had brought with me
the first volume of Lyell's 'Principles of Geology,' which I studied
attentively; and the book was of the highest service to me in many ways.
The very first place which I examined, namely St. Jago in the Cape de
Verde islands, showed me clearly the wonderful superiority of Lyell's
manner of treating geology, compared with that of any other author,
whose works I had with me or ever afterwards read.

Another of my occupations was collecting animals of all classes, briefly
describing and roughly dissecting many of the marine ones; but from not
being able to draw, and from not having sufficient anatomical knowledge,
a great pile of MS. which I made during the voyage has proved almost
useless. I thus lost much time, with the exception of that spent in
acquiring some knowledge of the Crustaceans, as this was of service when
in after years I undertook a monograph of the Cirripedia.

During some part of the day I wrote my Journal, and took much pains in
describing carefully and vividly all that I had seen; and this was good
practice. My Journal served also, in part, as letters to my home, and
portions were sent to England whenever there was an opportunity.

The above various special studies were, however, of no importance
compared with the habit of energetic industry and of concentrated
attention to whatever I was engaged in, which I then acquired.
Everything about which I thought or read was made to bear directly
on what I had seen or was likely to see; and this habit of mind was
continued during the five years of the voyage. I feel sure that it
was this training which has enabled me to do whatever I have done in
science.

Looking backwards, I can now perceive how my love for science gradually
preponderated over every other taste. During the first two years my old
passion for shooting survived in nearly full force, and I shot myself
all the birds and animals for my collection; but gradually I gave up my
gun more and more, and finally altogether, to my servant, as shooting
interfered with my work, more especially with making out the geological
structure of a country. I discovered, though unconsciously and
insensibly, that the pleasure of observing and reasoning was a much
higher one than that of skill and sport. That my mind became developed
through my pursuits during the voyage is rendered probable by a remark
made by my father, who was the most acute observer whom I ever saw, of a
sceptical disposition, and far from being a believer in phrenology; for
on first seeing me after the voyage, he turned round to my sisters, and
exclaimed, "Why, the shape of his head is quite altered."

To return to the voyage. On September 11th (1831), I paid a flying visit
with Fitz-Roy to the "Beagle" at Plymouth. Thence to Shrewsbury to wish
my father and sisters a long farewell. On October 24th I took up my
residence at Plymouth, and remained there until December 27th, when the
"Beagle" finally left the shores of England for her circumnavigation of
the world. We made two earlier attempts to sail, but were driven back
each time by heavy gales. These two months at Plymouth were the most
miserable which I ever spent, though I exerted myself in various ways.
I was out of spirits at the thought of leaving all my family and friends
for so long a time, and the weather seemed to me inexpressibly gloomy.
I was also troubled with palpitation and pain about the heart, and like
many a young ignorant man, especially one with a smattering of medical
knowledge, was convinced that I had heart disease. I did not consult any
doctor, as I fully expected to hear the verdict that I was not fit for
the voyage, and I was resolved to go at all hazards.

I need not here refer to the events of the voyage--where we went and
what we did--as I have given a sufficiently full account in my published
Journal. The glories of the vegetation of the Tropics rise before my
mind at the present time more vividly than anything else; though
the sense of sublimity, which the great deserts of Patagonia and the
forest-clad mountains of Tierra del Fuego excited in me, has left an
indelible impression on my mind. The sight of a naked savage in his
native land is an event which can never be forgotten. Many of my
excursions on horseback through wild countries, or in the boats, some
of which lasted several weeks, were deeply interesting: their discomfort
and some degree of danger were at that time hardly a drawback, and none
at all afterwards. I also reflect with high satisfaction on some of
my scientific work, such as solving the problem of coral islands, and
making out the geological structure of certain islands, for instance,
St. Helena. Nor must I pass over the discovery of the singular relations
of the animals and plants inhabiting the several islands of the
Galapagos archipelago, and of all of them to the inhabitants of South
America.

As far as I can judge of myself, I worked to the utmost during the
voyage from the mere pleasure of investigation, and from my strong
desire to add a few facts to the great mass of facts in Natural
Science. But I was also ambitious to take a fair place among scientific
men,--whether more ambitious or less so than most of my fellow-workers,
I can form no opinion.

The geology of St. Jago is very striking, yet simple: a stream of lava
formerly flowed over the bed of the sea, formed of triturated recent
shells and corals, which it has baked into a hard white rock. Since then
the whole island has been upheaved. But the line of white rock revealed
to me a new and important fact, namely, that there had been afterwards
subsidence round the craters, which had since been in action, and had
poured forth lava. It then first dawned on me that I might perhaps write
a book on the geology of the various countries visited, and this made me
thrill with delight. That was a memorable hour to me, and how distinctly
I can call to mind the low cliff of lava beneath which I rested, with
the sun glaring hot, a few strange desert plants growing near, and
with living corals in the tidal pools at my feet. Later in the voyage,
Fitz-Roy asked me to read some of my Journal, and declared it would be
worth publishing; so here was a second book in prospect!

Towards the close of our voyage I received a letter whilst at Ascension,
in which my sisters told me that Sedgwick had called on my father, and
said that I should take a place among the leading scientific men. I
could not at the time understand how he could have learnt anything of
my proceedings, but I heard (I believe afterwards) that Henslow had
read some of the letters which I wrote to him before the Philosophical
Society of Cambridge (Read at the meeting held November 16, 1835, and
printed in a pamphlet of 31 pages for distribution among the members
of the Society.), and had printed them for private distribution. My
collection of fossil bones, which had been sent to Henslow, also excited
considerable attention amongst palaeontologists. After reading this
letter, I clambered over the mountains of Ascension with a bounding
step, and made the volcanic rocks resound under my geological hammer.
All this shows how ambitious I was; but I think that I can say with
truth that in after years, though I cared in the highest degree for the
approbation of such men as Lyell and Hooker, who were my friends, I
did not care much about the general public. I do not mean to say that a
favourable review or a large sale of my books did not please me greatly,
but the pleasure was a fleeting one, and I am sure that I have never
turned one inch out of my course to gain fame.




FROM MY RETURN TO ENGLAND (OCTOBER 2, 1836) TO MY MARRIAGE (JANUARY 29,
1839.)

These two years and three months were the most active ones which I ever
spent, though I was occasionally unwell, and so lost some time. After
going backwards and forwards several times between Shrewsbury,
Maer, Cambridge, and London, I settled in lodgings at Cambridge (In
Fitzwilliam Street.) on December 13th, where all my collections were
under the care of Henslow. I stayed here three months, and got my
minerals and rocks examined by the aid of Professor Miller.

I began preparing my 'Journal of Travels,' which was not hard work,
as my MS. Journal had been written with care, and my chief labour was
making an abstract of my more interesting scientific results. I sent
also, at the request of Lyell, a short account of my observations on
the elevation of the coast of Chile to the Geological Society. ('Geolog.
Soc. Proc. ii. 1838, pages 446-449.)

On March 7th, 1837, I took lodgings in Great Marlborough Street in
London, and remained there for nearly two years, until I was married.
During these two years I finished my Journal, read several papers before
the Geological Society, began preparing the MS. for my 'Geological
Observations,' and arranged for the publication of the 'Zoology of the
Voyage of the "Beagle".' In July I opened my first note-book for facts
in relation to the Origin of Species, about which I had long reflected,
and never ceased working for the next twenty years.

During these two years I also went a little into society, and acted as
one of the honorary secretaries of the Geological Society. I saw a great
deal of Lyell. One of his chief characteristics was his sympathy with
the work of others, and I was as much astonished as delighted at the
interest which he showed when, on my return to England, I explained to
him my views on coral reefs. This encouraged me greatly, and his advice
and example had much influence on me. During this time I saw also a good
deal of Robert Brown; I used often to call and sit with him during his
breakfast on Sunday mornings, and he poured forth a rich treasure of
curious observations and acute remarks, but they almost always related
to minute points, and he never with me discussed large or general
questions in science.

During these two years I took several short excursions as a relaxation,
and one longer one to the Parallel Roads of Glen Roy, an account of
which was published in the 'Philosophical Transactions.' (1839, pages
39-82.) This paper was a great failure, and I am ashamed of it. Having
been deeply impressed with what I had seen of the elevation of the land
of South America, I attributed the parallel lines to the action of
the sea; but I had to give up this view when Agassiz propounded his
glacier-lake theory. Because no other explanation was possible under our
then state of knowledge, I argued in favour of sea-action; and my error
has been a good lesson to me never to trust in science to the principle
of exclusion.

As I was not able to work all day at science, I read a good deal during
these two years on various subjects, including some metaphysical books;
but I was not well fitted for such studies. About this time I took much
delight in Wordsworth's and Coleridge's poetry; and can boast that I
read the 'Excursion' twice through. Formerly Milton's 'Paradise Lost'
had been my chief favourite, and in my excursions during the voyage of
the "Beagle", when I could take only a single volume, I always chose
Milton.




FROM MY MARRIAGE, JANUARY 29, 1839, AND RESIDENCE IN UPPER GOWER STREET,
TO OUR LEAVING LONDON AND SETTLING AT DOWN, SEPTEMBER 14, 1842.

(After speaking of his happy married life, and of his children, he
continues:--)

During the three years and eight months whilst we resided in London, I
did less scientific work, though I worked as hard as I possibly could,
than during any other equal length of time in my life. This was owing
to frequently recurring unwellness, and to one long and serious illness.
The greater part of my time, when I could do anything, was devoted to
my work on 'Coral Reefs,' which I had begun before my marriage, and of
which the last proof-sheet was corrected on May 6th, 1842. This book,
though a small one, cost me twenty months of hard work, as I had to read
every work on the islands of the Pacific and to consult many charts. It
was thought highly of by scientific men, and the theory therein given
is, I think, now well established.

No other work of mine was begun in so deductive a spirit as this, for
the whole theory was thought out on the west coast of South America,
before I had seen a true coral reef. I had therefore only to verify and
extend my views by a careful examination of living reefs. But it should
be observed that I had during the two previous years been incessantly
attending to the effects on the shores of South America of the
intermittent elevation of the land, together with denudation and the
deposition of sediment. This necessarily led me to reflect much on the
effects of subsidence, and it was easy to replace in imagination the
continued deposition of sediment by the upward growth of corals. To do
this was to form my theory of the formation of barrier-reefs and atolls.

Besides my work on coral-reefs, during my residence in London, I read
before the Geological Society papers on the Erratic Boulders of South
America ('Geolog. Soc. Proc.' iii. 1842.), on Earthquakes ('Geolog.
Trans. v. 1840.), and on the Formation by the Agency of Earth-worms of
Mould. ('Geolog. Soc. Proc. ii. 1838.) I also continued to superintend
the publication of the 'Zoology of the Voyage of the "Beagle".' Nor did
I ever intermit collecting facts bearing on the origin of species; and I
could sometimes do this when I could do nothing else from illness.

In the summer of 1842 I was stronger than I had been for some time, and
took a little tour by myself in North Wales, for the sake of observing
the effects of the old glaciers which formerly filled all the larger
valleys. I published a short account of what I saw in the 'Philosophical
Magazine.' ('Philosophical Magazine,' 1842.) This excursion interested
me greatly, and it was the last time I was ever strong enough to climb
mountains or to take long walks such as are necessary for geological
work.

During the early part of our life in London, I was strong enough to go
into general society, and saw a good deal of several scientific men, and
other more or less distinguished men. I will give my impressions with
respect to some of them, though I have little to say worth saying.

I saw more of Lyell than of any other man, both before and after
my marriage. His mind was characterised, as it appeared to me, by
clearness, caution, sound judgment, and a good deal of originality. When
I made any remark to him on Geology, he never rested until he saw the
whole case clearly, and often made me see it more clearly than I had
done before. He would advance all possible objections to my suggestion,
and even after these were exhausted would long remain dubious. A second
characteristic was his hearty sympathy with the work of other scientific
men. (The slight repetition here observable is accounted for by the
notes on Lyell, etc., having been added in April, 1881, a few years
after the rest of the 'Recollections' were written.)

On my return from the voyage of the "Beagle", I explained to him
my views on coral-reefs, which differed from his, and I was greatly
surprised and encouraged by the vivid interest which he showed. His
delight in science was ardent, and he felt the keenest interest in the
future progress of mankind. He was very kind-hearted, and thoroughly
liberal in his religious beliefs, or rather disbeliefs; but he was a
strong theist. His candour was highly remarkable. He exhibited this by
becoming a convert to the Descent theory, though he had gained much
fame by opposing Lamarck's views, and this after he had grown old. He
reminded me that I had many years before said to him, when discussing
the opposition of the old school of geologists to his new views, "What
a good thing it would be if every scientific man was to die when sixty
years old, as afterwards he would be sure to oppose all new doctrines."
But he hoped that now he might be allowed to live.

The science of Geology is enormously indebted to Lyell--more so, as I
believe, than to any other man who ever lived. When [I was] starting on
the voyage of the "Beagle", the sagacious Henslow, who, like all other
geologists, believed at that time in successive cataclysms, advised me
to get and study the first volume of the 'Principles,' which had then
just been published, but on no account to accept the views therein
advocated. How differently would anyone now speak of the 'Principles'! I
am proud to remember that the first place, namely, St. Jago, in the
Cape de Verde archipelago, in which I geologised, convinced me of the
infinite superiority of Lyell's views over those advocated in any other
work known to me.

The powerful effects of Lyell's works could formerly be plainly seen in
the different progress of the science in France and England. The present
total oblivion of Elie de Beaumont's wild hypotheses, such as his
'Craters of Elevation' and 'Lines of Elevation' (which latter hypothesis
I heard Sedgwick at the Geological Society lauding to the skies), may be
largely attributed to Lyell.

I saw a good deal of Robert Brown, "facile Princeps Botanicorum," as he
was called by Humboldt. He seemed to me to be chiefly remarkable for
the minuteness of his observations, and their perfect accuracy. His
knowledge was extraordinarily great, and much died with him, owing to
his excessive fear of ever making a mistake. He poured out his knowledge
to me in the most unreserved manner, yet was strangely jealous on some
points. I called on him two or three times before the voyage of the
"Beagle", and on one occasion he asked me to look through a microscope
and describe what I saw. This I did, and believe now that it was the
marvellous currents of protoplasm in some vegetable cell. I then asked
him what I had seen; but he answered me, "That is my little secret."

He was capable of the most generous actions. When old, much out of
health, and quite unfit for any exertion, he daily visited (as Hooker
told me) an old man-servant, who lived at a distance (and whom he
supported), and read aloud to him. This is enough to make up for any
degree of scientific penuriousness or jealousy.

I may here mention a few other eminent men, whom I have occasionally
seen, but I have little to say about them worth saying. I felt a high
reverence for Sir J. Herschel, and was delighted to dine with him at his
charming house at the Cape of Good Hope, and afterwards at his London
house. I saw him, also, on a few other occasions. He never talked much,
but every word which he uttered was worth listening to.

I once met at breakfast at Sir R. Murchison's house the illustrious
Humboldt, who honoured me by expressing a wish to see me. I was a little
disappointed with the great man, but my anticipations probably were too
high. I can remember nothing distinctly about our interview, except that
Humboldt was very cheerful and talked much.

--reminds me of Buckle whom I once met at Hensleigh Wedgwood's. I was
very glad to learn from him his system of collecting facts. He told me
that he bought all the books which he read, and made a full index, to
each, of the facts which he thought might prove serviceable to him, and
that he could always remember in what book he had read anything, for his
memory was wonderful. I asked him how at first he could judge what facts
would be serviceable, and he answered that he did not know, but that a
sort of instinct guided him. From this habit of making indices, he was
enabled to give the astonishing number of references on all sorts of
subjects, which may be found in his 'History of Civilisation.' This book
I thought most interesting, and read it twice, but I doubt whether his
generalisations are worth anything. Buckle was a great talker, and I
listened to him saying hardly a word, nor indeed could I have done so
for he left no gaps. When Mrs. Farrer began to sing, I jumped up and
said that I must listen to her; after I had moved away he turned around
to a friend and said (as was overheard by my brother), "Well, Mr.
Darwin's books are much better than his conversation."

Of other great literary men, I once met Sydney Smith at Dean Milman's
house. There was something inexplicably amusing in every word which he
uttered. Perhaps this was partly due to the expectation of being amused.
He was talking about Lady Cork, who was then extremely old. This was the
lady who, as he said, was once so much affected by one of his charity
sermons, that she _borrowed_ a guinea from a friend to put in the plate.
He now said "It is generally believed that my dear old friend Lady Cork
has been overlooked," and he said this in such a manner that no one
could for a moment doubt that he meant that his dear old friend had been
overlooked by the devil. How he managed to express this I know not.

I likewise once met Macaulay at Lord Stanhope's (the historian's) house,
and as there was only one other man at dinner, I had a grand opportunity
of hearing him converse, and he was very agreeable. He did not talk at
all too much; nor indeed could such a man talk too much, as long as he
allowed others to turn the stream of his conversation, and this he did
allow.

Lord Stanhope once gave me a curious little proof of the accuracy and
fulness of Macaulay's memory: many historians used often to meet at
Lord Stanhope's house, and in discussing various subjects they would
sometimes differ from Macaulay, and formerly they often referred to some
book to see who was right; but latterly, as Lord Stanhope noticed, no
historian ever took this trouble, and whatever Macaulay said was final.

On another occasion I met at Lord Stanhope's house, one of his parties
of historians and other literary men, and amongst them were Motley and
Grote. After luncheon I walked about Chevening Park for nearly an hour
with Grote, and was much interested by his conversation and pleased by
the simplicity and absence of all pretension in his manners.

Long ago I dined occasionally with the old Earl, the father of the
historian; he was a strange man, but what little I knew of him I
liked much. He was frank, genial, and pleasant. He had strongly marked
features, with a brown complexion, and his clothes, when I saw him,
were all brown. He seemed to believe in everything which was to others
utterly incredible. He said one day to me, "Why don't you give up your
fiddle-faddle of geology and zoology, and turn to the occult sciences!"
The historian, then Lord Mahon, seemed shocked at such a speech to me,
and his charming wife much amused.

The last man whom I will mention is Carlyle, seen by me several times at
my brother's house, and two or three times at my own house. His talk was
very racy and interesting, just like his writings, but he sometimes
went on too long on the same subject. I remember a funny dinner at my
brother's, where, amongst a few others, were Babbage and Lyell, both of
whom liked to talk. Carlyle, however, silenced every one by haranguing
during the whole dinner on the advantages of silence. After dinner
Babbage, in his grimmest manner, thanked Carlyle for his very
interesting lecture on silence.

Carlyle sneered at almost every one: one day in my house he called
Grote's 'History' "a fetid quagmire, with nothing spiritual about it." I
always thought, until his 'Reminiscences' appeared, that his sneers were
partly jokes, but this now seems rather doubtful. His expression was
that of a depressed, almost despondent yet benevolent man; and it is
notorious how heartily he laughed. I believe that his benevolence was
real, though stained by not a little jealousy. No one can doubt about
his extraordinary power of drawing pictures of things and men--far more
vivid, as it appears to me, than any drawn by Macaulay. Whether his
pictures of men were true ones is another question.

He has been all-powerful in impressing some grand moral truths on the
minds of men. On the other hand, his views about slavery were revolting.
In his eyes might was right. His mind seemed to me a very narrow one;
even if all branches of science, which he despised, are excluded. It is
astonishing to me that Kingsley should have spoken of him as a man
well fitted to advance science. He laughed to scorn the idea that a
mathematician, such as Whewell, could judge, as I maintained he could,
of Goethe's views on light. He thought it a most ridiculous thing that
any one should care whether a glacier moved a little quicker or a little
slower, or moved at all. As far as I could judge, I never met a man with
a mind so ill adapted for scientific research.

Whilst living in London, I attended as regularly as I could the
meetings of several scientific societies, and acted as secretary to the
Geological Society. But such attendance, and ordinary society, suited my
health so badly that we resolved to live in the country, which we both
preferred and have never repented of.




RESIDENCE AT DOWN FROM SEPTEMBER 14, 1842, TO THE PRESENT TIME, 1876.

After several fruitless searches in Surrey and elsewhere, we found this
house and purchased it. I was pleased with the diversified appearance
of vegetation proper to a chalk district, and so unlike what I had been
accustomed to in the Midland counties; and still more pleased with the
extreme quietness and rusticity of the place. It is not, however, quite
so retired a place as a writer in a German periodical makes it, who
says that my house can be approached only by a mule-track! Our fixing
ourselves here has answered admirably in one way, which we did not
anticipate, namely, by being very convenient for frequent visits from
our children.

Few persons can have lived a more retired life than we have done.
Besides short visits to the houses of relations, and occasionally to the
seaside or elsewhere, we have gone nowhere. During the first part of
our residence we went a little into society, and received a few friends
here; but my health almost always suffered from the excitement, violent
shivering and vomiting attacks being thus brought on. I have therefore
been compelled for many years to give up all dinner-parties; and this
has been somewhat of a deprivation to me, as such parties always put me
into high spirits. From the same cause I have been able to invite here
very few scientific acquaintances.

My chief enjoyment and sole employment throughout life has been
scientific work; and the excitement from such work makes me for the
time forget, or drives quite away, my daily discomfort. I have therefore
nothing to record during the rest of my life, except the publication
of my several books. Perhaps a few details how they arose may be worth
giving.




MY SEVERAL PUBLICATIONS.

In the early part of 1844, my observations on the volcanic islands
visited during the voyage of the "Beagle" were published. In 1845,
I took much pains in correcting a new edition of my 'Journal of
Researches,' which was originally published in 1839 as part of
Fitz-Roy's work. The success of this, my first literary child, always
tickles my vanity more than that of any of my other books. Even to this
day it sells steadily in England and the United States, and has been
translated for the second time into German, and into French and other
languages. This success of a book of travels, especially of a scientific
one, so many years after its first publication, is surprising. Ten
thousand copies have been sold in England of the second edition. In 1846
my 'Geological Observations on South America' were published. I record
in a little diary, which I have always kept, that my three geological
books ('Coral Reefs' included) consumed four and a half years' steady
work; "and now it is ten years since my return to England. How much time
have I lost by illness?" I have nothing to say about these three books
except that to my surprise new editions have lately been called for.
('Geological Observations,' 2nd Edit.1876. 'Coral Reefs,' 2nd Edit.
1874.)

In October, 1846, I began to work on 'Cirripedia.' When on the coast of
Chile, I found a most curious form, which burrowed into the shells of
Concholepas, and which differed so much from all other Cirripedes that
I had to form a new sub-order for its sole reception. Lately an allied
burrowing genus has been found on the shores of Portugal. To understand
the structure of my new Cirripede I had to examine and dissect many
of the common forms; and this gradually led me on to take up the whole
group. I worked steadily on this subject for the next eight years, and
ultimately published two thick volumes (Published by the Ray Society.),
describing all the known living species, and two thin quartos on the
extinct species. I do not doubt that Sir E. Lytton Bulwer had me in his
mind when he introduced in one of his novels a Professor Long, who had
written two huge volumes on limpets.

Although I was employed during eight years on this work, yet I record in
my diary that about two years out of this time was lost by illness. On
this account I went in 1848 for some months to Malvern for hydropathic
treatment, which did me much good, so that on my return home I was able
to resume work. So much was I out of health that when my dear father
died on November 13th, 1848, I was unable to attend his funeral or to
act as one of his executors.

My work on the Cirripedia possesses, I think, considerable value, as
besides describing several new and remarkable forms, I made out the
homologies of the various parts--I discovered the cementing apparatus,
though I blundered dreadfully about the cement glands--and lastly I
proved the existence in certain genera of minute males complemental to
and parasitic on the hermaphrodites. This latter discovery has at last
been fully confirmed; though at one time a German writer was pleased to
attribute the whole account to my fertile imagination. The Cirripedes
form a highly varying and difficult group of species to class; and my
work was of considerable use to me, when I had to discuss in the 'Origin
of Species' the principles of a natural classification. Nevertheless, I
doubt whether the work was worth the consumption of so much time.

From September 1854 I devoted my whole time to arranging my huge
pile of notes, to observing, and to experimenting in relation to the
transmutation of species. During the voyage of the "Beagle" I had been
deeply impressed by discovering in the Pampean formation great fossil
animals covered with armour like that on the existing armadillos;
secondly, by the manner in which closely allied animals replace one
another in proceeding southwards over the Continent; and thirdly, by
the South American character of most of the productions of the Galapagos
archipelago, and more especially by the manner in which they differ
slightly on each island of the group; none of the islands appearing to
be very ancient in a geological sense.

It was evident that such facts as these, as well as many others, could
only be explained on the supposition that species gradually become
modified; and the subject haunted me. But it was equally evident that
neither the action of the surrounding conditions, nor the will of the
organisms (especially in the case of plants) could account for the
innumerable cases in which organisms of every kind are beautifully
adapted to their habits of life--for instance, a woodpecker or a
tree-frog to climb trees, or a seed for dispersal by hooks or plumes. I
had always been much struck by such adaptations, and until these could
be explained it seemed to me almost useless to endeavour to prove by
indirect evidence that species have been modified.

After my return to England it appeared to me that by following the
example of Lyell in Geology, and by collecting all facts which bore in
any way on the variation of animals and plants under domestication and
nature, some light might perhaps be thrown on the whole subject. My
first note-book was opened in July 1837. I worked on true Baconian
principles, and without any theory collected facts on a wholesale scale,
more especially with respect to domesticated productions, by printed
enquiries, by conversation with skilful breeders and gardeners, and by
extensive reading. When I see the list of books of all kinds which
I read and abstracted, including whole series of Journals and
Transactions, I am surprised at my industry. I soon perceived that
selection was the keystone of man's success in making useful races of
animals and plants. But how selection could be applied to organisms
living in a state of nature remained for some time a mystery to me.

In October 1838, that is, fifteen months after I had begun my systematic
enquiry, I happened to read for amusement 'Malthus on Population,'
and being well prepared to appreciate the struggle for existence which
everywhere goes on from long-continued observation of the habits of
animals and plants, it at once struck me that under these circumstances
favourable variations would tend to be preserved, and unfavourable
ones to be destroyed. The result of this would be the formation of new
species. Here then I had at last got a theory by which to work; but I
was so anxious to avoid prejudice, that I determined not for some time
to write even the briefest sketch of it. In June 1842 I first allowed
myself the satisfaction of writing a very brief abstract of my theory in
pencil in 35 pages; and this was enlarged during the summer of 1844 into
one of 230 pages, which I had fairly copied out and still possess.

But at that time I overlooked one problem of great importance; and it is
astonishing to me, except on the principle of Columbus and his egg,
how I could have overlooked it and its solution. This problem is the
tendency in organic beings descended from the same stock to diverge in
character as they become modified. That they have diverged greatly is
obvious from the manner in which species of all kinds can be classed
under genera, genera under families, families under sub-orders and
so forth; and I can remember the very spot in the road, whilst in my
carriage, when to my joy the solution occurred to me; and this was
long after I had come to Down. The solution, as I believe, is that the
modified offspring of all dominant and increasing forms tend to become
adapted to many and highly diversified places in the economy of nature.

Early in 1856 Lyell advised me to write out my views pretty fully, and
I began at once to do so on a scale three or four times as extensive as
that which was afterwards followed in my 'Origin of Species;' yet it
was only an abstract of the materials which I had collected, and I got
through about half the work on this scale. But my plans were overthrown,
for early in the summer of 1858 Mr. Wallace, who was then in the Malay
archipelago, sent me an essay "On the Tendency of Varieties to depart
indefinitely from the Original Type;" and this essay contained exactly
the same theory as mine. Mr. Wallace expressed the wish that if I
thought well of his essay, I should sent it to Lyell for perusal.

The circumstances under which I consented at the request of Lyell and
Hooker to allow of an abstract from my MS., together with a letter to
Asa Gray, dated September 5, 1857, to be published at the same time with
Wallace's Essay, are given in the 'Journal of the Proceedings of the
Linnean Society,' 1858, page 45. I was at first very unwilling
to consent, as I thought Mr. Wallace might consider my doing so
unjustifiable, for I did not then know how generous and noble was his
disposition. The extract from my MS. and the letter to Asa Gray had
neither been intended for publication, and were badly written. Mr.
Wallace's essay, on the other hand, was admirably expressed and
quite clear. Nevertheless, our joint productions excited very little
attention, and the only published notice of them which I can remember
was by Professor Haughton of Dublin, whose verdict was that all that
was new in them was false, and what was true was old. This shows how
necessary it is that any new view should be explained at considerable
length in order to arouse public attention.

In September 1858 I set to work by the strong advice of Lyell and Hooker
to prepare a volume on the transmutation of species, but was often
interrupted by ill-health, and short visits to Dr. Lane's delightful
hydropathic establishment at Moor Park. I abstracted the MS. begun on a
much larger scale in 1856, and completed the volume on the same reduced
scale. It cost me thirteen months and ten days' hard labour. It was
published under the title of the 'Origin of Species,' in November 1859.
Though considerably added to and corrected in the later editions, it has
remained substantially the same book.

It is no doubt the chief work of my life. It was from the first highly
successful. The first small edition of 1250 copies was sold on the day
of publication, and a second edition of 3000 copies soon afterwards.
Sixteen thousand copies have now (1876) been sold in England; and
considering how stiff a book it is, this is a large sale. It has been
translated into almost every European tongue, even into such languages
as Spanish, Bohemian, Polish, and Russian. It has also, according to
Miss Bird, been translated into Japanese (Miss Bird is mistaken, as I
learn from Prof. Mitsukuri.--F.D.), and is there much studied. Even an
essay in Hebrew has appeared on it, showing that the theory is contained
in the Old Testament! The reviews were very numerous; for some time I
collected all that appeared on the 'Origin' and on my related books, and
these amount (excluding newspaper reviews) to 265; but after a time I
gave up the attempt in despair. Many separate essays and books on the
subject have appeared; and in Germany a catalogue or bibliography on
"Darwinismus" has appeared every year or two.

The success of the 'Origin' may, I think, be attributed in large part to
my having long before written two condensed sketches, and to my having
finally abstracted a much larger manuscript, which was itself an
abstract. By this means I was enabled to select the more striking facts
and conclusions. I had, also, during many years followed a golden rule,
namely, that whenever a published fact, a new observation or thought
came across me, which was opposed to my general results, to make a
memorandum of it without fail and at once; for I had found by experience
that such facts and thoughts were far more apt to escape from the memory
than favourable ones. Owing to this habit, very few objections were
raised against my views which I had not at least noticed and attempted
to answer.

It has sometimes been said that the success of the 'Origin' proved "that
the subject was in the air," or "that men's minds were prepared for it."
I do not think that this is strictly true, for I occasionally sounded
not a few naturalists, and never happened to come across a single one
who seemed to doubt about the permanence of species. Even Lyell and
Hooker, though they would listen with interest to me, never seemed to
agree. I tried once or twice to explain to able men what I meant by
Natural Selection, but signally failed. What I believe was strictly
true is that innumerable well-observed facts were stored in the minds
of naturalists ready to take their proper places as soon as any theory
which would receive them was sufficiently explained. Another element
in the success of the book was its moderate size; and this I owe to the
appearance of Mr. Wallace's essay; had I published on the scale in which
I began to write in 1856, the book would have been four or five times as
large as the 'Origin,' and very few would have had the patience to read
it.

I gained much by my delay in publishing from about 1839, when the theory
was clearly conceived, to 1859; and I lost nothing by it, for I cared
very little whether men attributed most originality to me or Wallace;
and his essay no doubt aided in the reception of the theory. I was
forestalled in only one important point, which my vanity has always made
me regret, namely, the explanation by means of the Glacial period of
the presence of the same species of plants and of some few animals on
distant mountain summits and in the arctic regions. This view pleased me
so much that I wrote it out in extenso, and I believe that it was read
by Hooker some years before E. Forbes published his celebrated memoir
('Geolog. Survey Mem.,' 1846.) on the subject. In the very few points in
which we differed, I still think that I was in the right. I have never,
of course, alluded in print to my having independently worked out this
view.

Hardly any point gave me so much satisfaction when I was at work on
the 'Origin,' as the explanation of the wide difference in many classes
between the embryo and the adult animal, and of the close resemblance of
the embryos within the same class. No notice of this point was taken, as
far as I remember, in the early reviews of the 'Origin,' and I recollect
expressing my surprise on this head in a letter to Asa Gray. Within late
years several reviewers have given the whole credit to Fritz Muller and
Hackel, who undoubtedly have worked it out much more fully, and in some
respects more correctly than I did. I had materials for a whole chapter
on the subject, and I ought to have made the discussion longer; for it
is clear that I failed to impress my readers; and he who succeeds in
doing so deserves, in my opinion, all the credit.

This leads me to remark that I have almost always been treated honestly
by my reviewers, passing over those without scientific knowledge as
not worthy of notice. My views have often been grossly misrepresented,
bitterly opposed and ridiculed, but this has been generally done, as I
believe, in good faith. On the whole I do not doubt that my works have
been over and over again greatly overpraised. I rejoice that I have
avoided controversies, and this I owe to Lyell, who many years ago,
in reference to my geological works, strongly advised me never to get
entangled in a controversy, as it rarely did any good and caused a
miserable loss of time and temper.

Whenever I have found out that I have blundered, or that my work has
been imperfect, and when I have been contemptuously criticised, and even
when I have been overpraised, so that I have felt mortified, it has
been my greatest comfort to say hundreds of times to myself that "I
have worked as hard and as well as I could, and no man can do more
than this." I remember when in Good Success Bay, in Tierra del Fuego,
thinking (and, I believe, that I wrote home to the effect) that I could
not employ my life better than in adding a little to Natural Science.
This I have done to the best of my abilities, and critics may say what
they like, but they cannot destroy this conviction.

During the two last months of 1859 I was fully occupied in preparing a
second edition of the 'Origin,' and by an enormous correspondence.
On January 1st, 1860, I began arranging my notes for my work on the
'Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication;' but it was not
published until the beginning of 1868; the delay having been caused
partly by frequent illnesses, one of which lasted seven months, and
partly by being tempted to publish on other subjects which at the time
interested me more.

On May 15th, 1862, my little book on the 'Fertilisation of Orchids,'
which cost me ten months' work, was published: most of the facts had
been slowly accumulated during several previous years. During the summer
of 1839, and, I believe, during the previous summer, I was led to attend
to the cross-fertilisation of flowers by the aid of insects, from having
come to the conclusion in my speculations on the origin of species, that
crossing played an important part in keeping specific forms constant. I
attended to the subject more or less during every subsequent summer; and
my interest in it was greatly enhanced by having procured and read
in November 1841, through the advice of Robert Brown, a copy of C.K.
Sprengel's wonderful book, 'Das entdeckte Geheimniss der Natur.' For
some years before 1862 I had specially attended to the fertilisation
of our British orchids; and it seemed to me the best plan to prepare as
complete a treatise on this group of plants as well as I could, rather
than to utilise the great mass of matter which I had slowly collected
with respect to other plants.

My resolve proved a wise one; for since the appearance of my book, a
surprising number of papers and separate works on the fertilisation of
all kinds of flowers have appeared: and these are far better done than
I could possibly have effected. The merits of poor old Sprengel, so long
overlooked, are now fully recognised many years after his death.

During the same year I published in the 'Journal of the Linnean Society'
a paper "On the Two Forms, or Dimorphic Condition of Primula,"
and during the next five years, five other papers on dimorphic and
trimorphic plants. I do not think anything in my scientific life has
given me so much satisfaction as making out the meaning of the structure
of these plants. I had noticed in 1838 or 1839 the dimorphism of Linum
flavum, and had at first thought that it was merely a case of unmeaning
variability. But on examining the common species of Primula I found that
the two forms were much too regular and constant to be thus viewed. I
therefore became almost convinced that the common cowslip and primrose
were on the high road to become dioecious;--that the short pistil in the
one form, and the short stamens in the other form were tending towards
abortion. The plants were therefore subjected under this point of view
to trial; but as soon as the flowers with short pistils fertilised with
pollen from the short stamens, were found to yield more seeds than any
other of the four possible unions, the abortion-theory was knocked on
the head. After some additional experiment, it became evident that the
two forms, though both were perfect hermaphrodites, bore almost the same
relation to one another as do the two sexes of an ordinary animal. With
Lythrum we have the still more wonderful case of three forms standing in
a similar relation to one another. I afterwards found that the offspring
from the union of two plants belonging to the same forms presented a
close and curious analogy with hybrids from the union of two distinct
species.

In the autumn of 1864 I finished a long paper on 'Climbing Plants,' and
sent it to the Linnean Society. The writing of this paper cost me four
months; but I was so unwell when I received the proof-sheets that I was
forced to leave them very badly and often obscurely expressed. The paper
was little noticed, but when in 1875 it was corrected and published as a
separate book it sold well. I was led to take up this subject by reading
a short paper by Asa Gray, published in 1858. He sent me seeds, and
on raising some plants I was so much fascinated and perplexed by the
revolving movements of the tendrils and stems, which movements are
really very simple, though appearing at first sight very complex, that
I procured various other kinds of climbing plants, and studied the
whole subject. I was all the more attracted to it, from not being at all
satisfied with the explanation which Henslow gave us in his lectures,
about twining plants, namely, that they had a natural tendency to grow
up in a spire. This explanation proved quite erroneous. Some of the
adaptations displayed by Climbing Plants are as beautiful as those of
Orchids for ensuring cross-fertilisation.

My 'Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication' was begun, as
already stated, in the beginning of 1860, but was not published until
the beginning of 1868. It was a big book, and cost me four years and two
months' hard labour. It gives all my observations and an immense number
of facts collected from various sources, about our domestic productions.
In the second volume the causes and laws of variation, inheritance,
etc., are discussed as far as our present state of knowledge permits.
Towards the end of the work I give my well-abused hypothesis of
Pangenesis. An unverified hypothesis is of little or no value; but if
anyone should hereafter be led to make observations by which some such
hypothesis could be established, I shall have done good service, as an
astonishing number of isolated facts can be thus connected together and
rendered intelligible. In 1875 a second and largely corrected edition,
which cost me a good deal of labour, was brought out.

My 'Descent of Man' was published in February, 1871. As soon as I had
become, in the year 1837 or 1838, convinced that species were mutable
productions, I could not avoid the belief that man must come under
the same law. Accordingly I collected notes on the subject for my own
satisfaction, and not for a long time with any intention of publishing.
Although in the 'Origin of Species' the derivation of any particular
species is never discussed, yet I thought it best, in order that no
honourable man should accuse me of concealing my views, to add that by
the work "light would be thrown on the origin of man and his history."
It would have been useless and injurious to the success of the book to
have paraded, without giving any evidence, my conviction with respect to
his origin.

But when I found that many naturalists fully accepted the doctrine of
the evolution of species, it seemed to me advisable to work up such
notes as I possessed, and to publish a special treatise on the origin of
man. I was the more glad to do so, as it gave me an opportunity of
fully discussing sexual selection--a subject which had always greatly
interested me. This subject, and that of the variation of our
domestic productions, together with the causes and laws of variation,
inheritance, and the intercrossing of plants, are the sole subjects
which I have been able to write about in full, so as to use all the
materials which I have collected. The 'Descent of Man' took me three
years to write, but then as usual some of this time was lost by ill
health, and some was consumed by preparing new editions and other minor
works. A second and largely corrected edition of the 'Descent' appeared
in 1874.

My book on the 'Expression of the Emotions in Men and Animals' was
published in the autumn of 1872. I had intended to give only a chapter
on the subject in the 'Descent of Man,' but as soon as I began to put my
notes together, I saw that it would require a separate treatise.

My first child was born on December 27th, 1839, and I at once commenced
to make notes on the first dawn of the various expressions which he
exhibited, for I felt convinced, even at this early period, that the
most complex and fine shades of expression must all have had a gradual
and natural origin. During the summer of the following year, 1840,
I read Sir C. Bell's admirable work on expression, and this greatly
increased the interest which I felt in the subject, though I could not
at all agree with his belief that various muscles had been specially
created for the sake of expression. From this time forward I
occasionally attended to the subject, both with respect to man and our
domesticated animals. My book sold largely; 5267 copies having been
disposed of on the day of publication.

In the summer of 1860 I was idling and resting near Hartfield, where two
species of Drosera abound; and I noticed that numerous insects had been
entrapped by the leaves. I carried home some plants, and on giving them
insects saw the movements of the tentacles, and this made me think
it probable that the insects were caught for some special purpose.
Fortunately a crucial test occurred to me, that of placing a large
number of leaves in various nitrogenous and non-nitrogenous fluids of
equal density; and as soon as I found that the former alone excited
energetic movements, it was obvious that here was a fine new field for
investigation.

During subsequent years, whenever I had leisure, I pursued my
experiments, and my book on 'Insectivorous Plants' was published in July
1875--that is, sixteen years after my first observations. The delay in
this case, as with all my other books, has been a great advantage to me;
for a man after a long interval can criticise his own work, almost as
well as if it were that of another person. The fact that a plant should
secrete, when properly excited, a fluid containing an acid and ferment,
closely analogous to the digestive fluid of an animal, was certainly a
remarkable discovery.

During this autumn of 1876 I shall publish on the 'Effects of Cross
and Self-Fertilisation in the Vegetable Kingdom.' This book will form a
complement to that on the 'Fertilisation of Orchids,' in which I showed
how perfect were the means for cross-fertilisation, and here I shall
show how important are the results. I was led to make, during eleven
years, the numerous experiments recorded in this volume, by a mere
accidental observation; and indeed it required the accident to be
repeated before my attention was thoroughly aroused to the remarkable
fact that seedlings of self-fertilised parentage are inferior, even
in the first generation, in height and vigour to seedlings of
cross-fertilised parentage. I hope also to republish a revised edition
of my book on Orchids, and hereafter my papers on dimorphic and
trimorphic plants, together with some additional observations on allied
points which I never have had time to arrange. My strength will then
probably be exhausted, and I shall be ready to exclaim "Nunc dimittis."




WRITTEN MAY 1ST, 1881.

'The Effects of Cross and Self-Fertilisation' was published in the
autumn of 1876; and the results there arrived at explain, as I believe,
the endless and wonderful contrivances for the transportal of pollen
from one plant to another of the same species. I now believe, however,
chiefly from the observations of Hermann Muller, that I ought to
have insisted more strongly than I did on the many adaptations for
self-fertilisation; though I was well aware of many such adaptations. A
much enlarged edition of my 'Fertilisation of Orchids' was published in
1877.

In this same year 'The Different Forms of Flowers, etc.,' appeared,
and in 1880 a second edition. This book consists chiefly of the several
papers on Heterostyled flowers originally published by the Linnean
Society, corrected, with much new matter added, together with
observations on some other cases in which the same plant bears two kinds
of flowers. As before remarked, no little discovery of mine ever gave me
so much pleasure as the making out the meaning of heterostyled flowers.
The results of crossing such flowers in an illegitimate manner, I
believe to be very important, as bearing on the sterility of hybrids;
although these results have been noticed by only a few persons.

In 1879, I had a translation of Dr. Ernst Krause's 'Life of Erasmus
Darwin' published, and I added a sketch of his character and habits from
material in my possession. Many persons have been much interested by
this little life, and I am surprised that only 800 or 900 copies were
sold.

In 1880 I published, with [my son] Frank's assistance, our 'Power of
Movement in Plants.' This was a tough piece of work. The book bears
somewhat the same relation to my little book on 'Climbing Plants,' which
'Cross-Fertilisation' did to the 'Fertilisation of Orchids;' for in
accordance with the principle of evolution it was impossible to account
for climbing plants having been developed in so many widely different
groups unless all kinds of plants possess some slight power of movement
of an analogous kind. This I proved to be the case; and I was further
led to a rather wide generalisation, viz. that the great and important
classes of movements, excited by light, the attraction of gravity, etc.,
are all modified forms of the fundamental movement of circumnutation. It
has always pleased me to exalt plants in the scale of organised beings;
and I therefore felt an especial pleasure in showing how many and what
admirably well adapted movements the tip of a root possesses.

I have now (May 1, 1881) sent to the printers the MS. of a little book
on 'The Formation of Vegetable Mould, through the Action of Worms.' This
is a subject of but small importance; and I know not whether it will
interest any readers (Between November 1881 and February 1884, 8500
copies have been sold.), but it has interested me. It is the completion
of a short paper read before the Geological Society more than forty
years ago, and has revived old geological thoughts.

I have now mentioned all the books which I have published, and these
have been the milestones in my life, so that little remains to be said.
I am not conscious of any change in my mind during the last thirty
years, excepting in one point presently to be mentioned; nor, indeed,
could any change have been expected unless one of general deterioration.
But my father lived to his eighty-third year with his mind as lively as
ever it was, and all his faculties undimmed; and I hope that I may die
before my mind fails to a sensible extent. I think that I have become
a little more skilful in guessing right explanations and in devising
experimental tests; but this may probably be the result of mere
practice, and of a larger store of knowledge. I have as much difficulty
as ever in expressing myself clearly and concisely; and this difficulty
has caused me a very great loss of time; but it has had the compensating
advantage of forcing me to think long and intently about every sentence,
and thus I have been led to see errors in reasoning and in my own
observations or those of others.

There seems to be a sort of fatality in my mind leading me to put at
first my statement or proposition in a wrong or awkward form. Formerly
I used to think about my sentences before writing them down; but for
several years I have found that it saves time to scribble in a vile hand
whole pages as quickly as I possibly can, contracting half the words;
and then correct deliberately. Sentences thus scribbled down are often
better ones than I could have written deliberately.

Having said thus much about my manner of writing, I will add that with
my large books I spend a good deal of time over the general arrangement
of the matter. I first make the rudest outline in two or three pages,
and then a larger one in several pages, a few words or one word standing
for a whole discussion or series of facts. Each one of these headings is
again enlarged and often transferred before I begin to write in extenso.
As in several of my books facts observed by others have been very
extensively used, and as I have always had several quite distinct
subjects in hand at the same time, I may mention that I keep from thirty
to forty large portfolios, in cabinets with labelled shelves, into which
I can at once put a detached reference or memorandum. I have bought many
books, and at their ends I make an index of all the facts that concern
my work; or, if the book is not my own, write out a separate abstract,
and of such abstracts I have a large drawer full. Before beginning
on any subject I look to all the short indexes and make a general and
classified index, and by taking the one or more proper portfolios I have
all the information collected during my life ready for use.

I have said that in one respect my mind has changed during the last
twenty or thirty years. Up to the age of thirty, or beyond it, poetry
of many kinds, such as the works of Milton, Gray, Byron, Wordsworth,
Coleridge, and Shelley, gave me great pleasure, and even as a schoolboy
I took intense delight in Shakespeare, especially in the historical
plays. I have also said that formerly pictures gave me considerable, and
music very great delight. But now for many years I cannot endure to read
a line of poetry: I have tried lately to read Shakespeare, and found
it so intolerably dull that it nauseated me. I have also almost lost
my taste for pictures or music. Music generally sets me thinking too
energetically on what I have been at work on, instead of giving me
pleasure. I retain some taste for fine scenery, but it does not cause me
the exquisite delight which it formerly did. On the other hand, novels
which are works of the imagination, though not of a very high order,
have been for years a wonderful relief and pleasure to me, and I often
bless all novelists. A surprising number have been read aloud to me, and
I like all if moderately good, and if they do not end unhappily--against
which a law ought to be passed. A novel, according to my taste, does not
come into the first class unless it contains some person whom one can
thoroughly love, and if a pretty woman all the better.

This curious and lamentable loss of the higher aesthetic tastes is all
the odder, as books on history, biographies, and travels (independently
of any scientific facts which they may contain), and essays on all sorts
of subjects interest me as much as ever they did. My mind seems to
have become a kind of machine for grinding general laws out of large
collections of facts, but why this should have caused the atrophy of
that part of the brain alone, on which the higher tastes depend, I
cannot conceive. A man with a mind more highly organised or better
constituted than mine, would not, I suppose, have thus suffered; and
if I had to live my life again, I would have made a rule to read some
poetry and listen to some music at least once every week; for perhaps
the parts of my brain now atrophied would thus have been kept active
through use. The loss of these tastes is a loss of happiness, and may
possibly be injurious to the intellect, and more probably to the moral
character, by enfeebling the emotional part of our nature.

My books have sold largely in England, have been translated into many
languages, and passed through several editions in foreign countries. I
have heard it said that the success of a work abroad is the best test
of its enduring value. I doubt whether this is at all trustworthy; but
judged by this standard my name ought to last for a few years. Therefore
it may be worth while to try to analyse the mental qualities and the
conditions on which my success has depended; though I am aware that no
man can do this correctly.

I have no great quickness of apprehension or wit which is so remarkable
in some clever men, for instance, Huxley. I am therefore a poor critic:
a paper or book, when first read, generally excites my admiration,
and it is only after considerable reflection that I perceive the weak
points. My power to follow a long and purely abstract train of thought
is very limited; and therefore I could never have succeeded with
metaphysics or mathematics. My memory is extensive, yet hazy: it
suffices to make me cautious by vaguely telling me that I have observed
or read something opposed to the conclusion which I am drawing, or
on the other hand in favour of it; and after a time I can generally
recollect where to search for my authority. So poor in one sense is my
memory, that I have never been able to remember for more than a few days
a single date or a line of poetry.

Some of my critics have said, "Oh, he is a good observer, but he has
no power of reasoning!" I do not think that this can be true, for the
'Origin of Species' is one long argument from the beginning to the end,
and it has convinced not a few able men. No one could have written
it without having some power of reasoning. I have a fair share of
invention, and of common sense or judgment, such as every fairly
successful lawyer or doctor must have, but not, I believe, in any higher
degree.

On the favourable side of the balance, I think that I am superior to the
common run of men in noticing things which easily escape attention, and
in observing them carefully. My industry has been nearly as great as it
could have been in the observation and collection of facts. What is far
more important, my love of natural science has been steady and ardent.

This pure love has, however, been much aided by the ambition to be
esteemed by my fellow naturalists. From my early youth I have had the
strongest desire to understand or explain whatever I observed,--that is,
to group all facts under some general laws. These causes combined have
given me the patience to reflect or ponder for any number of years over
any unexplained problem. As far as I can judge, I am not apt to follow
blindly the lead of other men. I have steadily endeavoured to keep my
mind free so as to give up any hypothesis, however much beloved (and I
cannot resist forming one on every subject), as soon as facts are shown
to be opposed to it. Indeed, I have had no choice but to act in this
manner, for with the exception of the Coral Reefs, I cannot remember a
single first-formed hypothesis which had not after a time to be given
up or greatly modified. This has naturally led me to distrust greatly
deductive reasoning in the mixed sciences. On the other hand, I am not
very sceptical,--a frame of mind which I believe to be injurious to the
progress of science. A good deal of scepticism in a scientific man is
advisable to avoid much loss of time, but I have met with not a few
men, who, I feel sure, have often thus been deterred from experiment
or observations, which would have proved directly or indirectly
serviceable.

In illustration, I will give the oddest case which I have known. A
gentleman (who, as I afterwards heard, is a good local botanist) wrote
to me from the Eastern counties that the seed or beans of the common
field-bean had this year everywhere grown on the wrong side of the pod.
I wrote back, asking for further information, as I did not understand
what was meant; but I did not receive any answer for a very long time.
I then saw in two newspapers, one published in Kent and the other in
Yorkshire, paragraphs stating that it was a most remarkable fact that
"the beans this year had all grown on the wrong side." So I thought
there must be some foundation for so general a statement. Accordingly,
I went to my gardener, an old Kentish man, and asked him whether he had
heard anything about it, and he answered, "Oh, no, sir, it must be a
mistake, for the beans grow on the wrong side only on leap-year, and
this is not leap-year." I then asked him how they grew in common years
and how on leap-years, but soon found that he knew absolutely nothing of
how they grew at any time, but he stuck to his belief.

After a time I heard from my first informant, who, with many apologies,
said that he should not have written to me had he not heard the
statement from several intelligent farmers; but that he had since spoken
again to every one of them, and not one knew in the least what he had
himself meant. So that here a belief--if indeed a statement with no
definite idea attached to it can be called a belief--had spread over
almost the whole of England without any vestige of evidence.

I have known in the course of my life only three intentionally falsified
statements, and one of these may have been a hoax (and there have
been several scientific hoaxes) which, however, took in an American
Agricultural Journal. It related to the formation in Holland of a new
breed of oxen by the crossing of distinct species of Bos (some of which
I happen to know are sterile together), and the author had the impudence
to state that he had corresponded with me, and that I had been deeply
impressed with the importance of his result. The article was sent to me
by the editor of an English Agricultural Journal, asking for my opinion
before republishing it.

A second case was an account of several varieties, raised by the author
from several species of Primula, which had spontaneously yielded a
full complement of seed, although the parent plants had been carefully
protected from the access of insects. This account was published before
I had discovered the meaning of heterostylism, and the whole statement
must have been fraudulent, or there was neglect in excluding insects so
gross as to be scarcely credible.

The third case was more curious: Mr. Huth published in his book on
'Consanguineous Marriage' some long extracts from a Belgian author, who
stated that he had interbred rabbits in the closest manner for very
many generations, without the least injurious effects. The account was
published in a most respectable Journal, that of the Royal Society of
Belgium; but I could not avoid feeling doubts--I hardly know why, except
that there were no accidents of any kind, and my experience in breeding
animals made me think this very improbable.

So with much hesitation I wrote to Professor Van Beneden, asking him
whether the author was a trustworthy man. I soon heard in answer that
the Society had been greatly shocked by discovering that the whole
account was a fraud. (The falseness of the published statements on which
Mr. Huth relied has been pointed out by himself in a slip inserted in
all the copies of his book which then remained unsold.) The writer had
been publicly challenged in the Journal to say where he had resided and
kept his large stock of rabbits while carrying on his experiments, which
must have consumed several years, and no answer could be extracted from
him.

My habits are methodical, and this has been of not a little use for
my particular line of work. Lastly, I have had ample leisure from not
having to earn my own bread. Even ill-health, though it has annihilated
several years of my life, has saved me from the distractions of society
and amusement.

Therefore my success as a man of science, whatever this may have
amounted to, has been determined, as far as I can judge, by complex
and diversified mental qualities and conditions. Of these, the most
important have been--the love of science--unbounded patience in long
reflecting over any subject--industry in observing and collecting
facts--and a fair share of invention as well as of common sense. With
such moderate abilities as I possess, it is truly surprising that I
should have influenced to a considerable extent the belief of scientific
men on some important points.

PREFACE


A preface to the first edition of “Jane Eyre” being unnecessary, I gave
none: this second edition demands a few words both of acknowledgment
and miscellaneous remark.

My thanks are due in three quarters.

To the Public, for the indulgent ear it has inclined to a plain tale
with few pretensions.

To the Press, for the fair field its honest suffrage has opened to an
obscure aspirant.

To my Publishers, for the aid their tact, their energy, their practical
sense and frank liberality have afforded an unknown and unrecommended
Author.

The Press and the Public are but vague personifications for me, and I
must thank them in vague terms; but my Publishers are definite: so are
certain generous critics who have encouraged me as only large-hearted
and high-minded men know how to encourage a struggling stranger; to
them, _i.e._, to my Publishers and the select Reviewers, I say
cordially, Gentlemen, I thank you from my heart.

Having thus acknowledged what I owe those who have aided and approved
me, I turn to another class; a small one, so far as I know, but not,
therefore, to be overlooked. I mean the timorous or carping few who
doubt the tendency of such books as “Jane Eyre:” in whose eyes whatever
is unusual is wrong; whose ears detect in each protest against
bigotry—that parent of crime—an insult to piety, that regent of God on
earth. I would suggest to such doubters certain obvious distinctions; I
would remind them of certain simple truths.

Conventionality is not morality. Self-righteousness is not religion. To
attack the first is not to assail the last. To pluck the mask from the
face of the Pharisee, is not to lift an impious hand to the Crown of
Thorns.

These things and deeds are diametrically opposed: they are as distinct
as is vice from virtue. Men too often confound them: they should not be
confounded: appearance should not be mistaken for truth; narrow human
doctrines, that only tend to elate and magnify a few, should not be
substituted for the world-redeeming creed of Christ. There is—I repeat
it—a difference; and it is a good, and not a bad action to mark broadly
and clearly the line of separation between them.

The world may not like to see these ideas dissevered, for it has been
accustomed to blend them; finding it convenient to make external show
pass for sterling worth—to let white-washed walls vouch for clean
shrines. It may hate him who dares to scrutinise and expose—to rase the
gilding, and show base metal under it—to penetrate the sepulchre, and
reveal charnel relics: but hate as it will, it is indebted to him.

Ahab did not like Micaiah, because he never prophesied good concerning
him, but evil; probably he liked the sycophant son of Chenaanah
better; yet might Ahab have escaped a bloody death, had he but stopped
his ears to flattery, and opened them to faithful counsel.

There is a man in our own days whose words are not framed to tickle
delicate ears: who, to my thinking, comes before the great ones of
society, much as the son of Imlah came before the throned Kings of
Judah and Israel; and who speaks truth as deep, with a power as
prophet-like and as vital—a mien as dauntless and as daring. Is the
satirist of “Vanity Fair” admired in high places? I cannot tell; but I
think if some of those amongst whom he hurls the Greek fire of his
sarcasm, and over whom he flashes the levin-brand of his denunciation,
were to take his warnings in time—they or their seed might yet escape a
fatal Rimoth-Gilead.

Why have I alluded to this man? I have alluded to him, Reader, because
I think I see in him an intellect profounder and more unique than his
contemporaries have yet recognised; because I regard him as the first
social regenerator of the day—as the very master of that working corps
who would restore to rectitude the warped system of things; because I
think no commentator on his writings has yet found the comparison that
suits him, the terms which rightly characterise his talent. They say he
is like Fielding: they talk of his wit, humour, comic powers. He
resembles Fielding as an eagle does a vulture: Fielding could stoop on
carrion, but Thackeray never does. His wit is bright, his humour
attractive, but both bear the same relation to his serious genius that
the mere lambent sheet-lightning playing under the edge of the
summer-cloud does to the electric death-spark hid in its womb. Finally,
I have alluded to Mr. Thackeray, because to him—if he will accept the
tribute of a total stranger—I have dedicated this second edition of
“JANE EYRE.”

NOTE TO THE THIRD EDITION


I avail myself of the opportunity which a third edition of “Jane Eyre”
affords me, of again addressing a word to the Public, to explain that
my claim to the title of novelist rests on this one work alone. If,
therefore, the authorship of other works of fiction has been attributed
to me, an honour is awarded where it is not merited; and consequently,
denied where it is justly due.

This explanation will serve to rectify mistakes which may already have
been made, and to prevent future errors.

_April_ 13_th_, 1848.




CHAPTER I


There was no possibility of taking a walk that day. We had been
wandering, indeed, in the leafless shrubbery an hour in the morning;
but since dinner (Mrs. Reed, when there was no company, dined early)
the cold winter wind had brought with it clouds so sombre, and a rain
so penetrating, that further outdoor exercise was now out of the
question.

I was glad of it: I never liked long walks, especially on chilly
afternoons: dreadful to me was the coming home in the raw twilight,
with nipped fingers and toes, and a heart saddened by the chidings of
Bessie, the nurse, and humbled by the consciousness of my physical
inferiority to Eliza, John, and Georgiana Reed.

The said Eliza, John, and Georgiana were now clustered round their mama
in the drawing-room: she lay reclined on a sofa by the fireside, and
with her darlings about her (for the time neither quarrelling nor
crying) looked perfectly happy. Me, she had dispensed from joining the
group; saying, “She regretted to be under the necessity of keeping me
at a distance; but that until she heard from Bessie, and could discover
by her own observation, that I was endeavouring in good earnest to
acquire a more sociable and childlike disposition, a more attractive
and sprightly manner—something lighter, franker, more natural, as it
were—she really must exclude me from privileges intended only for
contented, happy, little children.”

“What does Bessie say I have done?” I asked.

“Jane, I don’t like cavillers or questioners; besides, there is
something truly forbidding in a child taking up her elders in that
manner. Be seated somewhere; and until you can speak pleasantly, remain
silent.”

A breakfast-room adjoined the drawing-room, I slipped in there. It
contained a bookcase: I soon possessed myself of a volume, taking care
that it should be one stored with pictures. I mounted into the
window-seat: gathering up my feet, I sat cross-legged, like a Turk;
and, having drawn the red moreen curtain nearly close, I was shrined in
double retirement.

Folds of scarlet drapery shut in my view to the right hand; to the left
were the clear panes of glass, protecting, but not separating me from
the drear November day. At intervals, while turning over the leaves of
my book, I studied the aspect of that winter afternoon. Afar, it
offered a pale blank of mist and cloud; near a scene of wet lawn and
storm-beat shrub, with ceaseless rain sweeping away wildly before a
long and lamentable blast.

I returned to my book—Bewick’s History of British Birds: the
letterpress thereof I cared little for, generally speaking; and yet
there were certain introductory pages that, child as I was, I could not
pass quite as a blank. They were those which treat of the haunts of
sea-fowl; of “the solitary rocks and promontories” by them only
inhabited; of the coast of Norway, studded with isles from its southern
extremity, the Lindeness, or Naze, to the North Cape—

“Where the Northern Ocean, in vast whirls,
Boils round the naked, melancholy isles
Of farthest Thule; and the Atlantic surge
Pours in among the stormy Hebrides.”


Nor could I pass unnoticed the suggestion of the bleak shores of
Lapland, Siberia, Spitzbergen, Nova Zembla, Iceland, Greenland, with
“the vast sweep of the Arctic Zone, and those forlorn regions of dreary
space,—that reservoir of frost and snow, where firm fields of ice, the
accumulation of centuries of winters, glazed in Alpine heights above
heights, surround the pole, and concentre the multiplied rigours of
extreme cold.” Of these death-white realms I formed an idea of my own:
shadowy, like all the half-comprehended notions that float dim through
children’s brains, but strangely impressive. The words in these
introductory pages connected themselves with the succeeding vignettes,
and gave significance to the rock standing up alone in a sea of billow
and spray; to the broken boat stranded on a desolate coast; to the cold
and ghastly moon glancing through bars of cloud at a wreck just
sinking.

I cannot tell what sentiment haunted the quite solitary churchyard,
with its inscribed headstone; its gate, its two trees, its low horizon,
girdled by a broken wall, and its newly-risen crescent, attesting the
hour of eventide.

The two ships becalmed on a torpid sea, I believed to be marine
phantoms.

The fiend pinning down the thief’s pack behind him, I passed over
quickly: it was an object of terror.

So was the black horned thing seated aloof on a rock, surveying a
distant crowd surrounding a gallows.

Each picture told a story; mysterious often to my undeveloped
understanding and imperfect feelings, yet ever profoundly interesting:
as interesting as the tales Bessie sometimes narrated on winter
evenings, when she chanced to be in good humour; and when, having
brought her ironing-table to the nursery hearth, she allowed us to sit
about it, and while she got up Mrs. Reed’s lace frills, and crimped her
nightcap borders, fed our eager attention with passages of love and
adventure taken from old fairy tales and other ballads; or (as at a
later period I discovered) from the pages of Pamela, and Henry, Earl of
Moreland.

With Bewick on my knee, I was then happy: happy at least in my way. I
feared nothing but interruption, and that came too soon. The
breakfast-room door opened.

“Boh! Madam Mope!” cried the voice of John Reed; then he paused: he
found the room apparently empty.

“Where the dickens is she!” he continued. “Lizzy! Georgy! (calling to
his sisters) Joan is not here: tell mama she is run out into the
rain—bad animal!”

“It is well I drew the curtain,” thought I; and I wished fervently he
might not discover my hiding-place: nor would John Reed have found it
out himself; he was not quick either of vision or conception; but Eliza
just put her head in at the door, and said at once—

“She is in the window-seat, to be sure, Jack.”

And I came out immediately, for I trembled at the idea of being dragged
forth by the said Jack.

“What do you want?” I asked, with awkward diffidence.

“Say, ‘What do you want, Master Reed?’” was the answer. “I want you to
come here;” and seating himself in an arm-chair, he intimated by a
gesture that I was to approach and stand before him.

John Reed was a schoolboy of fourteen years old; four years older than
I, for I was but ten: large and stout for his age, with a dingy and
unwholesome skin; thick lineaments in a spacious visage, heavy limbs
and large extremities. He gorged himself habitually at table, which
made him bilious, and gave him a dim and bleared eye and flabby cheeks.
He ought now to have been at school; but his mama had taken him home
for a month or two, “on account of his delicate health.” Mr. Miles, the
master, affirmed that he would do very well if he had fewer cakes and
sweetmeats sent him from home; but the mother’s heart turned from an
opinion so harsh, and inclined rather to the more refined idea that
John’s sallowness was owing to over-application and, perhaps, to pining
after home.

John had not much affection for his mother and sisters, and an
antipathy to me. He bullied and punished me; not two or three times in
the week, nor once or twice in the day, but continually: every nerve I
had feared him, and every morsel of flesh in my bones shrank when he
came near. There were moments when I was bewildered by the terror he
inspired, because I had no appeal whatever against either his menaces
or his inflictions; the servants did not like to offend their young
master by taking my part against him, and Mrs. Reed was blind and deaf
on the subject: she never saw him strike or heard him abuse me, though
he did both now and then in her very presence, more frequently,
however, behind her back.

Habitually obedient to John, I came up to his chair: he spent some
three minutes in thrusting out his tongue at me as far as he could
without damaging the roots: I knew he would soon strike, and while
dreading the blow, I mused on the disgusting and ugly appearance of him
who would presently deal it. I wonder if he read that notion in my
face; for, all at once, without speaking, he struck suddenly and
strongly. I tottered, and on regaining my equilibrium retired back a
step or two from his chair.

“That is for your impudence in answering mama awhile since,” said he,
“and for your sneaking way of getting behind curtains, and for the look
you had in your eyes two minutes since, you rat!”

Accustomed to John Reed’s abuse, I never had an idea of replying to it;
my care was how to endure the blow which would certainly follow the
insult.

“What were you doing behind the curtain?” he asked.

“I was reading.”

“Show the book.”

I returned to the window and fetched it thence.

“You have no business to take our books; you are a dependent, mama
says; you have no money; your father left you none; you ought to beg,
and not to live here with gentlemen’s children like us, and eat the
same meals we do, and wear clothes at our mama’s expense. Now, I’ll
teach you to rummage my bookshelves: for they _are_ mine; all the house
belongs to me, or will do in a few years. Go and stand by the door, out
of the way of the mirror and the windows.”

I did so, not at first aware what was his intention; but when I saw him
lift and poise the book and stand in act to hurl it, I instinctively
started aside with a cry of alarm: not soon enough, however; the volume
was flung, it hit me, and I fell, striking my head against the door and
cutting it. The cut bled, the pain was sharp: my terror had passed its
climax; other feelings succeeded.

“Wicked and cruel boy!” I said. “You are like a murderer—you are like a
slave-driver—you are like the Roman emperors!”

I had read Goldsmith’s History of Rome, and had formed my opinion of
Nero, Caligula, &c. Also I had drawn parallels in silence, which I
never thought thus to have declared aloud.

“What! what!” he cried. “Did she say that to me? Did you hear her,
Eliza and Georgiana? Won’t I tell mama? but first—”

He ran headlong at me: I felt him grasp my hair and my shoulder: he had
closed with a desperate thing. I really saw in him a tyrant, a
murderer. I felt a drop or two of blood from my head trickle down my
neck, and was sensible of somewhat pungent suffering: these sensations
for the time predominated over fear, and I received him in frantic
sort. I don’t very well know what I did with my hands, but he called me
“Rat! Rat!” and bellowed out aloud. Aid was near him: Eliza and
Georgiana had run for Mrs. Reed, who was gone upstairs: she now came
upon the scene, followed by Bessie and her maid Abbot. We were parted:
I heard the words—

“Dear! dear! What a fury to fly at Master John!”

“Did ever anybody see such a picture of passion!”

Then Mrs. Reed subjoined—

“Take her away to the red-room, and lock her in there.” Four hands were
immediately laid upon me, and I was borne upstairs.




CHAPTER II


I resisted all the way: a new thing for me, and a circumstance which
greatly strengthened the bad opinion Bessie and Miss Abbot were
disposed to entertain of me. The fact is, I was a trifle beside myself;
or rather _out_ of myself, as the French would say: I was conscious
that a moment’s mutiny had already rendered me liable to strange
penalties, and, like any other rebel slave, I felt resolved, in my
desperation, to go all lengths.

“Hold her arms, Miss Abbot: she’s like a mad cat.”

“For shame! for shame!” cried the lady’s-maid. “What shocking conduct,
Miss Eyre, to strike a young gentleman, your benefactress’s son! Your
young master.”

“Master! How is he my master? Am I a servant?”

“No; you are less than a servant, for you do nothing for your keep.
There, sit down, and think over your wickedness.”

They had got me by this time into the apartment indicated by Mrs. Reed,
and had thrust me upon a stool: my impulse was to rise from it like a
spring; their two pair of hands arrested me instantly.

“If you don’t sit still, you must be tied down,” said Bessie. “Miss
Abbot, lend me your garters; she would break mine directly.”

Miss Abbot turned to divest a stout leg of the necessary ligature. This
preparation for bonds, and the additional ignominy it inferred, took a
little of the excitement out of me.

“Don’t take them off,” I cried; “I will not stir.”

In guarantee whereof, I attached myself to my seat by my hands.

“Mind you don’t,” said Bessie; and when she had ascertained that I was
really subsiding, she loosened her hold of me; then she and Miss Abbot
stood with folded arms, looking darkly and doubtfully on my face, as
incredulous of my sanity.

“She never did so before,” at last said Bessie, turning to the Abigail.

“But it was always in her,” was the reply. “I’ve told Missis often my
opinion about the child, and Missis agreed with me. She’s an underhand
little thing: I never saw a girl of her age with so much cover.”

Bessie answered not; but ere long, addressing me, she said—

“You ought to be aware, Miss, that you are under obligations to Mrs.
Reed: she keeps you: if she were to turn you off, you would have to go
to the poorhouse.”

I had nothing to say to these words: they were not new to me: my very
first recollections of existence included hints of the same kind. This
reproach of my dependence had become a vague sing-song in my ear: very
painful and crushing, but only half intelligible. Miss Abbot joined in—

“And you ought not to think yourself on an equality with the Misses
Reed and Master Reed, because Missis kindly allows you to be brought up
with them. They will have a great deal of money, and you will have
none: it is your place to be humble, and to try to make yourself
agreeable to them.”

“What we tell you is for your good,” added Bessie, in no harsh voice,
“you should try to be useful and pleasant, then, perhaps, you would
have a home here; but if you become passionate and rude, Missis will
send you away, I am sure.”

“Besides,” said Miss Abbot, “God will punish her: He might strike her
dead in the midst of her tantrums, and then where would she go? Come,
Bessie, we will leave her: I wouldn’t have her heart for anything. Say
your prayers, Miss Eyre, when you are by yourself; for if you don’t
repent, something bad might be permitted to come down the chimney and
fetch you away.”

They went, shutting the door, and locking it behind them.

The red-room was a square chamber, very seldom slept in, I might say
never, indeed, unless when a chance influx of visitors at Gateshead
Hall rendered it necessary to turn to account all the accommodation it
contained: yet it was one of the largest and stateliest chambers in the
mansion. A bed supported on massive pillars of mahogany, hung with
curtains of deep red damask, stood out like a tabernacle in the centre;
the two large windows, with their blinds always drawn down, were half
shrouded in festoons and falls of similar drapery; the carpet was red;
the table at the foot of the bed was covered with a crimson cloth; the
walls were a soft fawn colour with a blush of pink in it; the wardrobe,
the toilet-table, the chairs were of darkly polished old mahogany. Out
of these deep surrounding shades rose high, and glared white, the
piled-up mattresses and pillows of the bed, spread with a snowy
Marseilles counterpane. Scarcely less prominent was an ample cushioned
easy-chair near the head of the bed, also white, with a footstool
before it; and looking, as I thought, like a pale throne.

This room was chill, because it seldom had a fire; it was silent,
because remote from the nursery and kitchen; solemn, because it was
known to be so seldom entered. The house-maid alone came here on
Saturdays, to wipe from the mirrors and the furniture a week’s quiet
dust: and Mrs. Reed herself, at far intervals, visited it to review the
contents of a certain secret drawer in the wardrobe, where were stored
divers parchments, her jewel-casket, and a miniature of her deceased
husband; and in those last words lies the secret of the red-room—the
spell which kept it so lonely in spite of its grandeur.

Mr. Reed had been dead nine years: it was in this chamber he breathed
his last; here he lay in state; hence his coffin was borne by the
undertaker’s men; and, since that day, a sense of dreary consecration
had guarded it from frequent intrusion.

My seat, to which Bessie and the bitter Miss Abbot had left me riveted,
was a low ottoman near the marble chimney-piece; the bed rose before
me; to my right hand there was the high, dark wardrobe, with subdued,
broken reflections varying the gloss of its panels; to my left were the
muffled windows; a great looking-glass between them repeated the vacant
majesty of the bed and room. I was not quite sure whether they had
locked the door; and when I dared move, I got up and went to see. Alas!
yes: no jail was ever more secure. Returning, I had to cross before the
looking-glass; my fascinated glance involuntarily explored the depth it
revealed. All looked colder and darker in that visionary hollow than in
reality: and the strange little figure there gazing at me, with a white
face and arms specking the gloom, and glittering eyes of fear moving
where all else was still, had the effect of a real spirit: I thought it
like one of the tiny phantoms, half fairy, half imp, Bessie’s evening
stories represented as coming out of lone, ferny dells in moors, and
appearing before the eyes of belated travellers. I returned to my
stool.

Superstition was with me at that moment; but it was not yet her hour
for complete victory: my blood was still warm; the mood of the revolted
slave was still bracing me with its bitter vigour; I had to stem a
rapid rush of retrospective thought before I quailed to the dismal
present.

All John Reed’s violent tyrannies, all his sisters’ proud indifference,
all his mother’s aversion, all the servants’ partiality, turned up in
my disturbed mind like a dark deposit in a turbid well. Why was I
always suffering, always browbeaten, always accused, for ever
condemned? Why could I never please? Why was it useless to try to win
any one’s favour? Eliza, who was headstrong and selfish, was respected.
Georgiana, who had a spoiled temper, a very acrid spite, a captious and
insolent carriage, was universally indulged. Her beauty, her pink
cheeks and golden curls, seemed to give delight to all who looked at
her, and to purchase indemnity for every fault. John no one thwarted,
much less punished; though he twisted the necks of the pigeons, killed
the little pea-chicks, set the dogs at the sheep, stripped the hothouse
vines of their fruit, and broke the buds off the choicest plants in the
conservatory: he called his mother “old girl,” too; sometimes reviled
her for her dark skin, similar to his own; bluntly disregarded her
wishes; not unfrequently tore and spoiled her silk attire; and he was
still “her own darling.” I dared commit no fault: I strove to fulfil
every duty; and I was termed naughty and tiresome, sullen and sneaking,
from morning to noon, and from noon to night.

My head still ached and bled with the blow and fall I had received: no
one had reproved John for wantonly striking me; and because I had
turned against him to avert farther irrational violence, I was loaded
with general opprobrium.

“Unjust!—unjust!” said my reason, forced by the agonising stimulus into
precocious though transitory power: and Resolve, equally wrought up,
instigated some strange expedient to achieve escape from insupportable
oppression—as running away, or, if that could not be effected, never
eating or drinking more, and letting myself die.

What a consternation of soul was mine that dreary afternoon! How all my
brain was in tumult, and all my heart in insurrection! Yet in what
darkness, what dense ignorance, was the mental battle fought! I could
not answer the ceaseless inward question—_why_ I thus suffered; now, at
the distance of—I will not say how many years, I see it clearly.

I was a discord in Gateshead Hall: I was like nobody there; I had
nothing in harmony with Mrs. Reed or her children, or her chosen
vassalage. If they did not love me, in fact, as little did I love them.
They were not bound to regard with affection a thing that could not
sympathise with one amongst them; a heterogeneous thing, opposed to
them in temperament, in capacity, in propensities; a useless thing,
incapable of serving their interest, or adding to their pleasure; a
noxious thing, cherishing the germs of indignation at their treatment,
of contempt of their judgment. I know that had I been a sanguine,
brilliant, careless, exacting, handsome, romping child—though equally
dependent and friendless—Mrs. Reed would have endured my presence more
complacently; her children would have entertained for me more of the
cordiality of fellow-feeling; the servants would have been less prone
to make me the scapegoat of the nursery.

Daylight began to forsake the red-room; it was past four o’clock, and
the beclouded afternoon was tending to drear twilight. I heard the rain
still beating continuously on the staircase window, and the wind
howling in the grove behind the hall; I grew by degrees cold as a
stone, and then my courage sank. My habitual mood of humiliation,
self-doubt, forlorn depression, fell damp on the embers of my decaying
ire. All said I was wicked, and perhaps I might be so; what thought had
I been but just conceiving of starving myself to death? That certainly
was a crime: and was I fit to die? Or was the vault under the chancel
of Gateshead Church an inviting bourne? In such vault I had been told
did Mr. Reed lie buried; and led by this thought to recall his idea, I
dwelt on it with gathering dread. I could not remember him; but I knew
that he was my own uncle—my mother’s brother—that he had taken me when
a parentless infant to his house; and that in his last moments he had
required a promise of Mrs. Reed that she would rear and maintain me as
one of her own children. Mrs. Reed probably considered she had kept
this promise; and so she had, I dare say, as well as her nature would
permit her; but how could she really like an interloper not of her
race, and unconnected with her, after her husband’s death, by any tie?
It must have been most irksome to find herself bound by a hard-wrung
pledge to stand in the stead of a parent to a strange child she could
not love, and to see an uncongenial alien permanently intruded on her
own family group.

A singular notion dawned upon me. I doubted not—never doubted—that if
Mr. Reed had been alive he would have treated me kindly; and now, as I
sat looking at the white bed and overshadowed walls—occasionally also
turning a fascinated eye towards the dimly gleaming mirror—I began to
recall what I had heard of dead men, troubled in their graves by the
violation of their last wishes, revisiting the earth to punish the
perjured and avenge the oppressed; and I thought Mr. Reed’s spirit,
harassed by the wrongs of his sister’s child, might quit its
abode—whether in the church vault or in the unknown world of the
departed—and rise before me in this chamber. I wiped my tears and
hushed my sobs, fearful lest any sign of violent grief might waken a
preternatural voice to comfort me, or elicit from the gloom some haloed
face, bending over me with strange pity. This idea, consolatory in
theory, I felt would be terrible if realised: with all my might I
endeavoured to stifle it—I endeavoured to be firm. Shaking my hair from
my eyes, I lifted my head and tried to look boldly round the dark room;
at this moment a light gleamed on the wall. Was it, I asked myself, a
ray from the moon penetrating some aperture in the blind? No; moonlight
was still, and this stirred; while I gazed, it glided up to the ceiling
and quivered over my head. I can now conjecture readily that this
streak of light was, in all likelihood, a gleam from a lantern carried
by some one across the lawn: but then, prepared as my mind was for
horror, shaken as my nerves were by agitation, I thought the swift
darting beam was a herald of some coming vision from another world. My
heart beat thick, my head grew hot; a sound filled my ears, which I
deemed the rushing of wings; something seemed near me; I was oppressed,
suffocated: endurance broke down; I rushed to the door and shook the
lock in desperate effort. Steps came running along the outer passage;
the key turned, Bessie and Abbot entered.

“Miss Eyre, are you ill?” said Bessie.

“What a dreadful noise! it went quite through me!” exclaimed Abbot.

“Take me out! Let me go into the nursery!” was my cry.

“What for? Are you hurt? Have you seen something?” again demanded
Bessie.

“Oh! I saw a light, and I thought a ghost would come.” I had now got
hold of Bessie’s hand, and she did not snatch it from me.

“She has screamed out on purpose,” declared Abbot, in some disgust.
“And what a scream! If she had been in great pain one would have
excused it, but she only wanted to bring us all here: I know her
naughty tricks.”

“What is all this?” demanded another voice peremptorily; and Mrs. Reed
came along the corridor, her cap flying wide, her gown rustling
stormily. “Abbot and Bessie, I believe I gave orders that Jane Eyre
should be left in the red-room till I came to her myself.”

“Miss Jane screamed so loud, ma’am,” pleaded Bessie.

“Let her go,” was the only answer. “Loose Bessie’s hand, child: you
cannot succeed in getting out by these means, be assured. I abhor
artifice, particularly in children; it is my duty to show you that
tricks will not answer: you will now stay here an hour longer, and it
is only on condition of perfect submission and stillness that I shall
liberate you then.”

“O aunt! have pity! Forgive me! I cannot endure it—let me be punished
some other way! I shall be killed if—”

“Silence! This violence is all most repulsive:” and so, no doubt, she
felt it. I was a precocious actress in her eyes; she sincerely looked
on me as a compound of virulent passions, mean spirit, and dangerous
duplicity.

Bessie and Abbot having retreated, Mrs. Reed, impatient of my now
frantic anguish and wild sobs, abruptly thrust me back and locked me
in, without farther parley. I heard her sweeping away; and soon after
she was gone, I suppose I had a species of fit: unconsciousness closed
the scene.




CHAPTER III


The next thing I remember is, waking up with a feeling as if I had had
a frightful nightmare, and seeing before me a terrible red glare,
crossed with thick black bars. I heard voices, too, speaking with a
hollow sound, and as if muffled by a rush of wind or water: agitation,
uncertainty, and an all-predominating sense of terror confused my
faculties. Ere long, I became aware that some one was handling me;
lifting me up and supporting me in a sitting posture, and that more
tenderly than I had ever been raised or upheld before. I rested my head
against a pillow or an arm, and felt easy.

In five minutes more the cloud of bewilderment dissolved: I knew quite
well that I was in my own bed, and that the red glare was the nursery
fire. It was night: a candle burnt on the table; Bessie stood at the
bed-foot with a basin in her hand, and a gentleman sat in a chair near
my pillow, leaning over me.

I felt an inexpressible relief, a soothing conviction of protection and
security, when I knew that there was a stranger in the room, an
individual not belonging to Gateshead, and not related to Mrs. Reed.
Turning from Bessie (though her presence was far less obnoxious to me
than that of Abbot, for instance, would have been), I scrutinised the
face of the gentleman: I knew him; it was Mr. Lloyd, an apothecary,
sometimes called in by Mrs. Reed when the servants were ailing: for
herself and the children she employed a physician.

“Well, who am I?” he asked.

I pronounced his name, offering him at the same time my hand: he took
it, smiling and saying, “We shall do very well by-and-by.” Then he laid
me down, and addressing Bessie, charged her to be very careful that I
was not disturbed during the night. Having given some further
directions, and intimated that he should call again the next day, he
departed; to my grief: I felt so sheltered and befriended while he sat
in the chair near my pillow; and as he closed the door after him, all
the room darkened and my heart again sank: inexpressible sadness
weighed it down.

“Do you feel as if you should sleep, Miss?” asked Bessie, rather
softly.

Scarcely dared I answer her; for I feared the next sentence might be
rough. “I will try.”

“Would you like to drink, or could you eat anything?”

“No, thank you, Bessie.”

“Then I think I shall go to bed, for it is past twelve o’clock; but you
may call me if you want anything in the night.”

Wonderful civility this! It emboldened me to ask a question.

“Bessie, what is the matter with me? Am I ill?”

“You fell sick, I suppose, in the red-room with crying; you’ll be
better soon, no doubt.”

Bessie went into the housemaid’s apartment, which was near. I heard her
say—

“Sarah, come and sleep with me in the nursery; I daren’t for my life be
alone with that poor child to-night: she might die; it’s such a strange
thing she should have that fit: I wonder if she saw anything. Missis
was rather too hard.”

Sarah came back with her; they both went to bed; they were whispering
together for half-an-hour before they fell asleep. I caught scraps of
their conversation, from which I was able only too distinctly to infer
the main subject discussed.

“Something passed her, all dressed in white, and vanished”—“A great
black dog behind him”—“Three loud raps on the chamber door”—“A light in
the churchyard just over his grave,” &c., &c.

At last both slept: the fire and the candle went out. For me, the
watches of that long night passed in ghastly wakefulness; ear, eye, and
mind were alike strained by dread: such dread as children only can
feel.

No severe or prolonged bodily illness followed this incident of the
red-room; it only gave my nerves a shock of which I feel the
reverberation to this day. Yes, Mrs. Reed, to you I owe some fearful
pangs of mental suffering, but I ought to forgive you, for you knew not
what you did: while rending my heart-strings, you thought you were only
uprooting my bad propensities.

Next day, by noon, I was up and dressed, and sat wrapped in a shawl by
the nursery hearth. I felt physically weak and broken down: but my
worse ailment was an unutterable wretchedness of mind: a wretchedness
which kept drawing from me silent tears; no sooner had I wiped one salt
drop from my cheek than another followed. Yet, I thought, I ought to
have been happy, for none of the Reeds were there, they were all gone
out in the carriage with their mama. Abbot, too, was sewing in another
room, and Bessie, as she moved hither and thither, putting away toys
and arranging drawers, addressed to me every now and then a word of
unwonted kindness. This state of things should have been to me a
paradise of peace, accustomed as I was to a life of ceaseless reprimand
and thankless fagging; but, in fact, my racked nerves were now in such
a state that no calm could soothe, and no pleasure excite them
agreeably.

Bessie had been down into the kitchen, and she brought up with her a
tart on a certain brightly painted china plate, whose bird of paradise,
nestling in a wreath of convolvuli and rosebuds, had been wont to stir
in me a most enthusiastic sense of admiration; and which plate I had
often petitioned to be allowed to take in my hand in order to examine
it more closely, but had always hitherto been deemed unworthy of such a
privilege. This precious vessel was now placed on my knee, and I was
cordially invited to eat the circlet of delicate pastry upon it. Vain
favour! coming, like most other favours long deferred and often wished
for, too late! I could not eat the tart; and the plumage of the bird,
the tints of the flowers, seemed strangely faded: I put both plate and
tart away. Bessie asked if I would have a book: the word _book_ acted
as a transient stimulus, and I begged her to fetch Gulliver’s Travels
from the library. This book I had again and again perused with delight.
I considered it a narrative of facts, and discovered in it a vein of
interest deeper than what I found in fairy tales: for as to the elves,
having sought them in vain among foxglove leaves and bells, under
mushrooms and beneath the ground-ivy mantling old wall-nooks, I had at
length made up my mind to the sad truth, that they were all gone out of
England to some savage country where the woods were wilder and thicker,
and the population more scant; whereas, Lilliput and Brobdignag being,
in my creed, solid parts of the earth’s surface, I doubted not that I
might one day, by taking a long voyage, see with my own eyes the little
fields, houses, and trees, the diminutive people, the tiny cows, sheep,
and birds of the one realm; and the corn-fields forest-high, the mighty
mastiffs, the monster cats, the tower-like men and women, of the other.
Yet, when this cherished volume was now placed in my hand—when I turned
over its leaves, and sought in its marvellous pictures the charm I had,
till now, never failed to find—all was eerie and dreary; the giants
were gaunt goblins, the pigmies malevolent and fearful imps, Gulliver a
most desolate wanderer in most dread and dangerous regions. I closed
the book, which I dared no longer peruse, and put it on the table,
beside the untasted tart.

Bessie had now finished dusting and tidying the room, and having washed
her hands, she opened a certain little drawer, full of splendid shreds
of silk and satin, and began making a new bonnet for Georgiana’s doll.
Meantime she sang: her song was—

“In the days when we went gipsying,
    A long time ago.”


I had often heard the song before, and always with lively delight; for
Bessie had a sweet voice,—at least, I thought so. But now, though her
voice was still sweet, I found in its melody an indescribable sadness.
Sometimes, preoccupied with her work, she sang the refrain very low,
very lingeringly; “A long time ago” came out like the saddest cadence
of a funeral hymn. She passed into another ballad, this time a really
doleful one.

“My feet they are sore, and my limbs they are weary;
    Long is the way, and the mountains are wild;
Soon will the twilight close moonless and dreary
    Over the path of the poor orphan child.

Why did they send me so far and so lonely,
    Up where the moors spread and grey rocks are piled?
Men are hard-hearted, and kind angels only
    Watch o’er the steps of a poor orphan child.

Yet distant and soft the night breeze is blowing,
    Clouds there are none, and clear stars beam mild,
God, in His mercy, protection is showing,
    Comfort and hope to the poor orphan child.

Ev’n should I fall o’er the broken bridge passing,
    Or stray in the marshes, by false lights beguiled,
Still will my Father, with promise and blessing,
    Take to His bosom the poor orphan child.

There is a thought that for strength should avail me,
    Though both of shelter and kindred despoiled;
Heaven is a home, and a rest will not fail me;
    God is a friend to the poor orphan child.”


“Come, Miss Jane, don’t cry,” said Bessie as she finished. She might as
well have said to the fire, “don’t burn!” but how could she divine the
morbid suffering to which I was a prey? In the course of the morning
Mr. Lloyd came again.

“What, already up!” said he, as he entered the nursery. “Well, nurse,
how is she?”

Bessie answered that I was doing very well.

“Then she ought to look more cheerful. Come here, Miss Jane: your name
is Jane, is it not?”

“Yes, sir, Jane Eyre.”

“Well, you have been crying, Miss Jane Eyre; can you tell me what
about? Have you any pain?”

“No, sir.”

“Oh! I daresay she is crying because she could not go out with Missis
in the carriage,” interposed Bessie.

“Surely not! why, she is too old for such pettishness.”

I thought so too; and my self-esteem being wounded by the false charge,
I answered promptly, “I never cried for such a thing in my life: I hate
going out in the carriage. I cry because I am miserable.”

“Oh fie, Miss!” said Bessie.

The good apothecary appeared a little puzzled. I was standing before
him; he fixed his eyes on me very steadily: his eyes were small and
grey; not very bright, but I dare say I should think them shrewd now:
he had a hard-featured yet good-natured looking face. Having considered
me at leisure, he said—

“What made you ill yesterday?”

“She had a fall,” said Bessie, again putting in her word.

“Fall! why, that is like a baby again! Can’t she manage to walk at her
age? She must be eight or nine years old.”

“I was knocked down,” was the blunt explanation, jerked out of me by
another pang of mortified pride; “but that did not make me ill,” I
added; while Mr. Lloyd helped himself to a pinch of snuff.

As he was returning the box to his waistcoat pocket, a loud bell rang
for the servants’ dinner; he knew what it was. “That’s for you, nurse,”
said he; “you can go down; I’ll give Miss Jane a lecture till you come
back.”

Bessie would rather have stayed, but she was obliged to go, because
punctuality at meals was rigidly enforced at Gateshead Hall.

“The fall did not make you ill; what did, then?” pursued Mr. Lloyd when
Bessie was gone.

“I was shut up in a room where there is a ghost till after dark.”

I saw Mr. Lloyd smile and frown at the same time.

“Ghost! What, you are a baby after all! You are afraid of ghosts?”

“Of Mr. Reed’s ghost I am: he died in that room, and was laid out
there. Neither Bessie nor any one else will go into it at night, if
they can help it; and it was cruel to shut me up alone without a
candle,—so cruel that I think I shall never forget it.”

“Nonsense! And is it that makes you so miserable? Are you afraid now in
daylight?”

“No: but night will come again before long: and besides,—I am
unhappy,—very unhappy, for other things.”

“What other things? Can you tell me some of them?”

How much I wished to reply fully to this question! How difficult it was
to frame any answer! Children can feel, but they cannot analyse their
feelings; and if the analysis is partially effected in thought, they
know not how to express the result of the process in words. Fearful,
however, of losing this first and only opportunity of relieving my
grief by imparting it, I, after a disturbed pause, contrived to frame a
meagre, though, as far as it went, true response.

“For one thing, I have no father or mother, brothers or sisters.”

“You have a kind aunt and cousins.”

Again I paused; then bunglingly enounced—

“But John Reed knocked me down, and my aunt shut me up in the
red-room.”

Mr. Lloyd a second time produced his snuff-box.

“Don’t you think Gateshead Hall a very beautiful house?” asked he. “Are
you not very thankful to have such a fine place to live at?”

“It is not my house, sir; and Abbot says I have less right to be here
than a servant.”

“Pooh! you can’t be silly enough to wish to leave such a splendid
place?”

“If I had anywhere else to go, I should be glad to leave it; but I can
never get away from Gateshead till I am a woman.”

“Perhaps you may—who knows? Have you any relations besides Mrs. Reed?”

“I think not, sir.”

“None belonging to your father?”

“I don’t know: I asked Aunt Reed once, and she said possibly I might
have some poor, low relations called Eyre, but she knew nothing about
them.”

“If you had such, would you like to go to them?”

I reflected. Poverty looks grim to grown people; still more so to
children: they have not much idea of industrious, working, respectable
poverty; they think of the word only as connected with ragged clothes,
scanty food, fireless grates, rude manners, and debasing vices: poverty
for me was synonymous with degradation.

“No; I should not like to belong to poor people,” was my reply.

“Not even if they were kind to you?”

I shook my head: I could not see how poor people had the means of being
kind; and then to learn to speak like them, to adopt their manners, to
be uneducated, to grow up like one of the poor women I saw sometimes
nursing their children or washing their clothes at the cottage doors of
the village of Gateshead: no, I was not heroic enough to purchase
liberty at the price of caste.

“But are your relatives so very poor? Are they working people?”

“I cannot tell; Aunt Reed says if I have any, they must be a beggarly
set: I should not like to go a begging.”

“Would you like to go to school?”

Again I reflected: I scarcely knew what school was: Bessie sometimes
spoke of it as a place where young ladies sat in the stocks, wore
backboards, and were expected to be exceedingly genteel and precise:
John Reed hated his school, and abused his master; but John Reed’s
tastes were no rule for mine, and if Bessie’s accounts of
school-discipline (gathered from the young ladies of a family where she
had lived before coming to Gateshead) were somewhat appalling, her
details of certain accomplishments attained by these same young ladies
were, I thought, equally attractive. She boasted of beautiful paintings
of landscapes and flowers by them executed; of songs they could sing
and pieces they could play, of purses they could net, of French books
they could translate; till my spirit was moved to emulation as I
listened. Besides, school would be a complete change: it implied a long
journey, an entire separation from Gateshead, an entrance into a new
life.

“I should indeed like to go to school,” was the audible conclusion of
my musings.

“Well, well! who knows what may happen?” said Mr. Lloyd, as he got up.
“The child ought to have change of air and scene,” he added, speaking
to himself; “nerves not in a good state.”

Bessie now returned; at the same moment the carriage was heard rolling
up the gravel-walk.

“Is that your mistress, nurse?” asked Mr. Lloyd. “I should like to
speak to her before I go.”

Bessie invited him to walk into the breakfast-room, and led the way
out. In the interview which followed between him and Mrs. Reed, I
presume, from after-occurrences, that the apothecary ventured to
recommend my being sent to school; and the recommendation was no doubt
readily enough adopted; for as Abbot said, in discussing the subject
with Bessie when both sat sewing in the nursery one night, after I was
in bed, and, as they thought, asleep, “Missis was, she dared say, glad
enough to get rid of such a tiresome, ill-conditioned child, who always
looked as if she were watching everybody, and scheming plots
underhand.” Abbot, I think, gave me credit for being a sort of
infantine Guy Fawkes.

On that same occasion I learned, for the first time, from Miss Abbot’s
communications to Bessie, that my father had been a poor clergyman;
that my mother had married him against the wishes of her friends, who
considered the match beneath her; that my grandfather Reed was so
irritated at her disobedience, he cut her off without a shilling; that
after my mother and father had been married a year, the latter caught
the typhus fever while visiting among the poor of a large manufacturing
town where his curacy was situated, and where that disease was then
prevalent: that my mother took the infection from him, and both died
within a month of each other.

Bessie, when she heard this narrative, sighed and said, “Poor Miss Jane
is to be pitied, too, Abbot.”

“Yes,” responded Abbot; “if she were a nice, pretty child, one might
compassionate her forlornness; but one really cannot care for such a
little toad as that.”

“Not a great deal, to be sure,” agreed Bessie: “at any rate, a beauty
like Miss Georgiana would be more moving in the same condition.”

“Yes, I doat on Miss Georgiana!” cried the fervent Abbot. “Little
darling!—with her long curls and her blue eyes, and such a sweet colour
as she has; just as if she were painted!—Bessie, I could fancy a Welsh
rabbit for supper.”

“So could I—with a roast onion. Come, we’ll go down.” They went.




CHAPTER IV


From my discourse with Mr. Lloyd, and from the above reported
conference between Bessie and Abbot, I gathered enough of hope to
suffice as a motive for wishing to get well: a change seemed near,—I
desired and waited it in silence. It tarried, however: days and weeks
passed: I had regained my normal state of health, but no new allusion
was made to the subject over which I brooded. Mrs. Reed surveyed me at
times with a severe eye, but seldom addressed me: since my illness, she
had drawn a more marked line of separation than ever between me and her
own children; appointing me a small closet to sleep in by myself,
condemning me to take my meals alone, and pass all my time in the
nursery, while my cousins were constantly in the drawing-room. Not a
hint, however, did she drop about sending me to school: still I felt an
instinctive certainty that she would not long endure me under the same
roof with her; for her glance, now more than ever, when turned on me,
expressed an insuperable and rooted aversion.

Eliza and Georgiana, evidently acting according to orders, spoke to me
as little as possible: John thrust his tongue in his cheek whenever he
saw me, and once attempted chastisement; but as I instantly turned
against him, roused by the same sentiment of deep ire and desperate
revolt which had stirred my corruption before, he thought it better to
desist, and ran from me uttering execrations, and vowing I had burst
his nose. I had indeed levelled at that prominent feature as hard a
blow as my knuckles could inflict; and when I saw that either that or
my look daunted him, I had the greatest inclination to follow up my
advantage to purpose; but he was already with his mama. I heard him in
a blubbering tone commence the tale of how “that nasty Jane Eyre” had
flown at him like a mad cat: he was stopped rather harshly—

“Don’t talk to me about her, John: I told you not to go near her; she
is not worthy of notice; I do not choose that either you or your
sisters should associate with her.”

Here, leaning over the banister, I cried out suddenly, and without at
all deliberating on my words—

“They are not fit to associate with me.”

Mrs. Reed was rather a stout woman; but, on hearing this strange and
audacious declaration, she ran nimbly up the stair, swept me like a
whirlwind into the nursery, and crushing me down on the edge of my
crib, dared me in an emphatic voice to rise from that place, or utter
one syllable during the remainder of the day.

“What would Uncle Reed say to you, if he were alive?” was my scarcely
voluntary demand. I say scarcely voluntary, for it seemed as if my
tongue pronounced words without my will consenting to their utterance:
something spoke out of me over which I had no control.

“What?” said Mrs. Reed under her breath: her usually cold composed grey
eye became troubled with a look like fear; she took her hand from my
arm, and gazed at me as if she really did not know whether I were child
or fiend. I was now in for it.

“My Uncle Reed is in heaven, and can see all you do and think; and so
can papa and mama: they know how you shut me up all day long, and how
you wish me dead.”

Mrs. Reed soon rallied her spirits: she shook me most soundly, she
boxed both my ears, and then left me without a word. Bessie supplied
the hiatus by a homily of an hour’s length, in which she proved beyond
a doubt that I was the most wicked and abandoned child ever reared
under a roof. I half believed her; for I felt indeed only bad feelings
surging in my breast.

November, December, and half of January passed away. Christmas and the
New Year had been celebrated at Gateshead with the usual festive cheer;
presents had been interchanged, dinners and evening parties given. From
every enjoyment I was, of course, excluded: my share of the gaiety
consisted in witnessing the daily apparelling of Eliza and Georgiana,
and seeing them descend to the drawing-room, dressed out in thin muslin
frocks and scarlet sashes, with hair elaborately ringletted; and
afterwards, in listening to the sound of the piano or the harp played
below, to the passing to and fro of the butler and footman, to the
jingling of glass and china as refreshments were handed, to the broken
hum of conversation as the drawing-room door opened and closed. When
tired of this occupation, I would retire from the stairhead to the
solitary and silent nursery: there, though somewhat sad, I was not
miserable. To speak truth, I had not the least wish to go into company,
for in company I was very rarely noticed; and if Bessie had but been
kind and companionable, I should have deemed it a treat to spend the
evenings quietly with her, instead of passing them under the formidable
eye of Mrs. Reed, in a room full of ladies and gentlemen. But Bessie,
as soon as she had dressed her young ladies, used to take herself off
to the lively regions of the kitchen and housekeeper’s room, generally
bearing the candle along with her. I then sat with my doll on my knee
till the fire got low, glancing round occasionally to make sure that
nothing worse than myself haunted the shadowy room; and when the embers
sank to a dull red, I undressed hastily, tugging at knots and strings
as I best might, and sought shelter from cold and darkness in my crib.
To this crib I always took my doll; human beings must love something,
and, in the dearth of worthier objects of affection, I contrived to
find a pleasure in loving and cherishing a faded graven image, shabby
as a miniature scarecrow. It puzzles me now to remember with what
absurd sincerity I doated on this little toy, half fancying it alive
and capable of sensation. I could not sleep unless it was folded in my
night-gown; and when it lay there safe and warm, I was comparatively
happy, believing it to be happy likewise.

Long did the hours seem while I waited the departure of the company,
and listened for the sound of Bessie’s step on the stairs: sometimes
she would come up in the interval to seek her thimble or her scissors,
or perhaps to bring me something by way of supper—a bun or a
cheese-cake—then she would sit on the bed while I ate it, and when I
had finished, she would tuck the clothes round me, and twice she kissed
me, and said, “Good night, Miss Jane.” When thus gentle, Bessie seemed
to me the best, prettiest, kindest being in the world; and I wished
most intensely that she would always be so pleasant and amiable, and
never push me about, or scold, or task me unreasonably, as she was too
often wont to do. Bessie Lee must, I think, have been a girl of good
natural capacity, for she was smart in all she did, and had a
remarkable knack of narrative; so, at least, I judge from the
impression made on me by her nursery tales. She was pretty too, if my
recollections of her face and person are correct. I remember her as a
slim young woman, with black hair, dark eyes, very nice features, and
good, clear complexion; but she had a capricious and hasty temper, and
indifferent ideas of principle or justice: still, such as she was, I
preferred her to any one else at Gateshead Hall.

It was the fifteenth of January, about nine o’clock in the morning:
Bessie was gone down to breakfast; my cousins had not yet been summoned
to their mama; Eliza was putting on her bonnet and warm garden-coat to
go and feed her poultry, an occupation of which she was fond: and not
less so of selling the eggs to the housekeeper and hoarding up the
money she thus obtained. She had a turn for traffic, and a marked
propensity for saving; shown not only in the vending of eggs and
chickens, but also in driving hard bargains with the gardener about
flower-roots, seeds, and slips of plants; that functionary having
orders from Mrs. Reed to buy of his young lady all the products of her
parterre she wished to sell: and Eliza would have sold the hair off her
head if she could have made a handsome profit thereby. As to her money,
she first secreted it in odd corners, wrapped in a rag or an old
curl-paper; but some of these hoards having been discovered by the
housemaid, Eliza, fearful of one day losing her valued treasure,
consented to intrust it to her mother, at a usurious rate of
interest—fifty or sixty per cent.; which interest she exacted every
quarter, keeping her accounts in a little book with anxious accuracy.

Georgiana sat on a high stool, dressing her hair at the glass, and
interweaving her curls with artificial flowers and faded feathers, of
which she had found a store in a drawer in the attic. I was making my
bed, having received strict orders from Bessie to get it arranged
before she returned (for Bessie now frequently employed me as a sort of
under-nurserymaid, to tidy the room, dust the chairs, &c.). Having
spread the quilt and folded my night-dress, I went to the window-seat
to put in order some picture-books and doll’s house furniture scattered
there; an abrupt command from Georgiana to let her playthings alone
(for the tiny chairs and mirrors, the fairy plates and cups, were her
property) stopped my proceedings; and then, for lack of other
occupation, I fell to breathing on the frost-flowers with which the
window was fretted, and thus clearing a space in the glass through
which I might look out on the grounds, where all was still and
petrified under the influence of a hard frost.

From this window were visible the porter’s lodge and the carriage-road,
and just as I had dissolved so much of the silver-white foliage veiling
the panes as left room to look out, I saw the gates thrown open and a
carriage roll through. I watched it ascending the drive with
indifference; carriages often came to Gateshead, but none ever brought
visitors in whom I was interested; it stopped in front of the house,
the door-bell rang loudly, the new-comer was admitted. All this being
nothing to me, my vacant attention soon found livelier attraction in
the spectacle of a little hungry robin, which came and chirruped on the
twigs of the leafless cherry-tree nailed against the wall near the
casement. The remains of my breakfast of bread and milk stood on the
table, and having crumbled a morsel of roll, I was tugging at the sash
to put out the crumbs on the window-sill, when Bessie came running
upstairs into the nursery.

“Miss Jane, take off your pinafore; what are you doing there? Have you
washed your hands and face this morning?” I gave another tug before I
answered, for I wanted the bird to be secure of its bread: the sash
yielded; I scattered the crumbs, some on the stone sill, some on the
cherry-tree bough, then, closing the window, I replied—

“No, Bessie; I have only just finished dusting.”

“Troublesome, careless child! and what are you doing now? You look
quite red, as if you had been about some mischief: what were you
opening the window for?”

I was spared the trouble of answering, for Bessie seemed in too great a
hurry to listen to explanations; she hauled me to the washstand,
inflicted a merciless, but happily brief scrub on my face and hands
with soap, water, and a coarse towel; disciplined my head with a
bristly brush, denuded me of my pinafore, and then hurrying me to the
top of the stairs, bid me go down directly, as I was wanted in the
breakfast-room.

I would have asked who wanted me: I would have demanded if Mrs. Reed
was there; but Bessie was already gone, and had closed the nursery-door
upon me. I slowly descended. For nearly three months, I had never been
called to Mrs. Reed’s presence; restricted so long to the nursery, the
breakfast, dining, and drawing-rooms were become for me awful regions,
on which it dismayed me to intrude.

I now stood in the empty hall; before me was the breakfast-room door,
and I stopped, intimidated and trembling. What a miserable little
poltroon had fear, engendered of unjust punishment, made of me in those
days! I feared to return to the nursery, and feared to go forward to
the parlour; ten minutes I stood in agitated hesitation; the vehement
ringing of the breakfast-room bell decided me; I _must_ enter.

“Who could want me?” I asked inwardly, as with both hands I turned the
stiff door-handle, which, for a second or two, resisted my efforts.
“What should I see besides Aunt Reed in the apartment?—a man or a
woman?” The handle turned, the door unclosed, and passing through and
curtseying low, I looked up at—a black pillar!—such, at least, appeared
to me, at first sight, the straight, narrow, sable-clad shape standing
erect on the rug: the grim face at the top was like a carved mask,
placed above the shaft by way of capital.

Mrs. Reed occupied her usual seat by the fireside; she made a signal to
me to approach; I did so, and she introduced me to the stony stranger
with the words: “This is the little girl respecting whom I applied to
you.”

_He_, for it was a man, turned his head slowly towards where I stood,
and having examined me with the two inquisitive-looking grey eyes which
twinkled under a pair of bushy brows, said solemnly, and in a bass
voice, “Her size is small: what is her age?”

“Ten years.”

“So much?” was the doubtful answer; and he prolonged his scrutiny for
some minutes. Presently he addressed me—“Your name, little girl?”

“Jane Eyre, sir.”

In uttering these words I looked up: he seemed to me a tall gentleman;
but then I was very little; his features were large, and they and all
the lines of his frame were equally harsh and prim.

“Well, Jane Eyre, and are you a good child?”

Impossible to reply to this in the affirmative: my little world held a
contrary opinion: I was silent. Mrs. Reed answered for me by an
expressive shake of the head, adding soon, “Perhaps the less said on
that subject the better, Mr. Brocklehurst.”

“Sorry indeed to hear it! she and I must have some talk;” and bending
from the perpendicular, he installed his person in the arm-chair
opposite Mrs. Reed’s. “Come here,” he said.

I stepped across the rug; he placed me square and straight before him.
What a face he had, now that it was almost on a level with mine! what a
great nose! and what a mouth! and what large prominent teeth!

“No sight so sad as that of a naughty child,” he began, “especially a
naughty little girl. Do you know where the wicked go after death?”

“They go to hell,” was my ready and orthodox answer.

“And what is hell? Can you tell me that?”

“A pit full of fire.”

“And should you like to fall into that pit, and to be burning there for
ever?”

“No, sir.”

“What must you do to avoid it?”

I deliberated a moment; my answer, when it did come, was objectionable:
“I must keep in good health, and not die.”

“How can you keep in good health? Children younger than you die daily.
I buried a little child of five years old only a day or two since,—a
good little child, whose soul is now in heaven. It is to be feared the
same could not be said of you were you to be called hence.”

Not being in a condition to remove his doubt, I only cast my eyes down
on the two large feet planted on the rug, and sighed, wishing myself
far enough away.

“I hope that sigh is from the heart, and that you repent of ever having
been the occasion of discomfort to your excellent benefactress.”

“Benefactress! benefactress!” said I inwardly: “they all call Mrs. Reed
my benefactress; if so, a benefactress is a disagreeable thing.”

“Do you say your prayers night and morning?” continued my interrogator.

“Yes, sir.”

“Do you read your Bible?”

“Sometimes.”

“With pleasure? Are you fond of it?”

“I like Revelations, and the book of Daniel, and Genesis and Samuel,
and a little bit of Exodus, and some parts of Kings and Chronicles, and
Job and Jonah.”

“And the Psalms? I hope you like them?”

“No, sir.”

“No? oh, shocking! I have a little boy, younger than you, who knows six
Psalms by heart: and when you ask him which he would rather have, a
gingerbread-nut to eat or a verse of a Psalm to learn, he says: ‘Oh!
the verse of a Psalm! angels sing Psalms;’ says he, ‘I wish to be a
little angel here below;’ he then gets two nuts in recompense for his
infant piety.”

“Psalms are not interesting,” I remarked.

“That proves you have a wicked heart; and you must pray to God to
change it: to give you a new and clean one: to take away your heart of
stone and give you a heart of flesh.”

I was about to propound a question, touching the manner in which that
operation of changing my heart was to be performed, when Mrs. Reed
interposed, telling me to sit down; she then proceeded to carry on the
conversation herself.

“Mr. Brocklehurst, I believe I intimated in the letter which I wrote to
you three weeks ago, that this little girl has not quite the character
and disposition I could wish: should you admit her into Lowood school,
I should be glad if the superintendent and teachers were requested to
keep a strict eye on her, and, above all, to guard against her worst
fault, a tendency to deceit. I mention this in your hearing, Jane, that
you may not attempt to impose on Mr. Brocklehurst.”

Well might I dread, well might I dislike Mrs. Reed; for it was her
nature to wound me cruelly; never was I happy in her presence; however
carefully I obeyed, however strenuously I strove to please her, my
efforts were still repulsed and repaid by such sentences as the above.
Now, uttered before a stranger, the accusation cut me to the heart; I
dimly perceived that she was already obliterating hope from the new
phase of existence which she destined me to enter; I felt, though I
could not have expressed the feeling, that she was sowing aversion and
unkindness along my future path; I saw myself transformed under Mr.
Brocklehurst’s eye into an artful, noxious child, and what could I do
to remedy the injury?

“Nothing, indeed,” thought I, as I struggled to repress a sob, and
hastily wiped away some tears, the impotent evidences of my anguish.

“Deceit is, indeed, a sad fault in a child,” said Mr. Brocklehurst; “it
is akin to falsehood, and all liars will have their portion in the lake
burning with fire and brimstone; she shall, however, be watched, Mrs.
Reed. I will speak to Miss Temple and the teachers.”

“I should wish her to be brought up in a manner suiting her prospects,”
continued my benefactress; “to be made useful, to be kept humble: as
for the vacations, she will, with your permission, spend them always at
Lowood.”

“Your decisions are perfectly judicious, madam,” returned Mr.
Brocklehurst. “Humility is a Christian grace, and one peculiarly
appropriate to the pupils of Lowood; I, therefore, direct that especial
care shall be bestowed on its cultivation amongst them. I have studied
how best to mortify in them the worldly sentiment of pride; and, only
the other day, I had a pleasing proof of my success. My second
daughter, Augusta, went with her mama to visit the school, and on her
return she exclaimed: ‘Oh, dear papa, how quiet and plain all the girls
at Lowood look, with their hair combed behind their ears, and their
long pinafores, and those little holland pockets outside their
frocks—they are almost like poor people’s children! and,’ said she,
‘they looked at my dress and mama’s, as if they had never seen a silk
gown before.’”

“This is the state of things I quite approve,” returned Mrs. Reed; “had
I sought all England over, I could scarcely have found a system more
exactly fitting a child like Jane Eyre. Consistency, my dear Mr.
Brocklehurst; I advocate consistency in all things.”

“Consistency, madam, is the first of Christian duties; and it has been
observed in every arrangement connected with the establishment of
Lowood: plain fare, simple attire, unsophisticated accommodations,
hardy and active habits; such is the order of the day in the house and
its inhabitants.”

“Quite right, sir. I may then depend upon this child being received as
a pupil at Lowood, and there being trained in conformity to her
position and prospects?”

“Madam, you may: she shall be placed in that nursery of chosen plants,
and I trust she will show herself grateful for the inestimable
privilege of her election.”

“I will send her, then, as soon as possible, Mr. Brocklehurst; for, I
assure you, I feel anxious to be relieved of a responsibility that was
becoming too irksome.”

“No doubt, no doubt, madam; and now I wish you good morning. I shall
return to Brocklehurst Hall in the course of a week or two: my good
friend, the Archdeacon, will not permit me to leave him sooner. I shall
send Miss Temple notice that she is to expect a new girl, so that there
will be no difficulty about receiving her. Good-bye.”

“Good-bye, Mr. Brocklehurst; remember me to Mrs. and Miss Brocklehurst,
and to Augusta and Theodore, and Master Broughton Brocklehurst.”

“I will, madam. Little girl, here is a book entitled the ‘Child’s
Guide’; read it with prayer, especially that part containing ‘An
account of the awfully sudden death of Martha G——, a naughty child
addicted to falsehood and deceit.’”

With these words Mr. Brocklehurst put into my hand a thin pamphlet sewn
in a cover, and having rung for his carriage, he departed.

Mrs. Reed and I were left alone: some minutes passed in silence; she
was sewing, I was watching her. Mrs. Reed might be at that time some
six or seven and thirty; she was a woman of robust frame,
square-shouldered and strong-limbed, not tall, and, though stout, not
obese: she had a somewhat large face, the under jaw being much
developed and very solid; her brow was low, her chin large and
prominent, mouth and nose sufficiently regular; under her light
eyebrows glimmered an eye devoid of ruth; her skin was dark and opaque,
her hair nearly flaxen; her constitution was sound as a bell—illness
never came near her; she was an exact, clever manager; her household
and tenantry were thoroughly under her control; her children only at
times defied her authority and laughed it to scorn; she dressed well,
and had a presence and port calculated to set off handsome attire.

Sitting on a low stool, a few yards from her arm-chair, I examined her
figure; I perused her features. In my hand I held the tract containing
the sudden death of the Liar, to which narrative my attention had been
pointed as to an appropriate warning. What had just passed; what Mrs.
Reed had said concerning me to Mr. Brocklehurst; the whole tenor of
their conversation, was recent, raw, and stinging in my mind; I had
felt every word as acutely as I had heard it plainly, and a passion of
resentment fomented now within me.

Mrs. Reed looked up from her work; her eye settled on mine, her fingers
at the same time suspended their nimble movements.

“Go out of the room; return to the nursery,” was her mandate. My look
or something else must have struck her as offensive, for she spoke with
extreme though suppressed irritation. I got up, I went to the door; I
came back again; I walked to the window, across the room, then close up
to her.

_Speak_ I must: I had been trodden on severely, and _must_ turn: but
how? What strength had I to dart retaliation at my antagonist? I
gathered my energies and launched them in this blunt sentence—

“I am not deceitful: if I were, I should say I loved _you;_ but I
declare I do not love you: I dislike you the worst of anybody in the
world except John Reed; and this book about the liar, you may give to
your girl, Georgiana, for it is she who tells lies, and not I.”

Mrs. Reed’s hands still lay on her work inactive: her eye of ice
continued to dwell freezingly on mine.

“What more have you to say?” she asked, rather in the tone in which a
person might address an opponent of adult age than such as is
ordinarily used to a child.

That eye of hers, that voice stirred every antipathy I had. Shaking
from head to foot, thrilled with ungovernable excitement, I continued—

“I am glad you are no relation of mine: I will never call you aunt
again as long as I live. I will never come to see you when I am grown
up; and if any one asks me how I liked you, and how you treated me, I
will say the very thought of you makes me sick, and that you treated me
with miserable cruelty.”

“How dare you affirm that, Jane Eyre?”

“How dare I, Mrs. Reed? How dare I? Because it is the _truth_. You
think I have no feelings, and that I can do without one bit of love or
kindness; but I cannot live so: and you have no pity. I shall remember
how you thrust me back—roughly and violently thrust me back—into the
red-room, and locked me up there, to my dying day; though I was in
agony; though I cried out, while suffocating with distress, ‘Have
mercy! Have mercy, Aunt Reed!’ And that punishment you made me suffer
because your wicked boy struck me—knocked me down for nothing. I will
tell anybody who asks me questions, this exact tale. People think you a
good woman, but you are bad, hard-hearted. _You_ are deceitful!”


How dare I, Mrs. Reed? How dare I? Because it is the truth

Ere I had finished this reply, my soul began to expand, to exult, with
the strangest sense of freedom, of triumph, I ever felt. It seemed as
if an invisible bond had burst, and that I had struggled out into
unhoped-for liberty. Not without cause was this sentiment: Mrs. Reed
looked frightened; her work had slipped from her knee; she was lifting
up her hands, rocking herself to and fro, and even twisting her face as
if she would cry.

“Jane, you are under a mistake: what is the matter with you? Why do you
tremble so violently? Would you like to drink some water?”

“No, Mrs. Reed.”

“Is there anything else you wish for, Jane? I assure you, I desire to
be your friend.”

“Not you. You told Mr. Brocklehurst I had a bad character, a deceitful
disposition; and I’ll let everybody at Lowood know what you are, and
what you have done.”

“Jane, you don’t understand these things: children must be corrected
for their faults.”

“Deceit is not my fault!” I cried out in a savage, high voice.

“But you are passionate, Jane, that you must allow: and now return to
the nursery—there’s a dear—and lie down a little.”

“I am not your dear; I cannot lie down: send me to school soon, Mrs.
Reed, for I hate to live here.”

“I will indeed send her to school soon,” murmured Mrs. Reed _sotto
voce_; and gathering up her work, she abruptly quitted the apartment.

I was left there alone—winner of the field. It was the hardest battle I
had fought, and the first victory I had gained: I stood awhile on the
rug, where Mr. Brocklehurst had stood, and I enjoyed my conqueror’s
solitude. First, I smiled to myself and felt elate; but this fierce
pleasure subsided in me as fast as did the accelerated throb of my
pulses. A child cannot quarrel with its elders, as I had done; cannot
give its furious feelings uncontrolled play, as I had given mine,
without experiencing afterwards the pang of remorse and the chill of
reaction. A ridge of lighted heath, alive, glancing, devouring, would
have been a meet emblem of my mind when I accused and menaced Mrs.
Reed: the same ridge, black and blasted after the flames are dead,
would have represented as meetly my subsequent condition, when
half-an-hour’s silence and reflection had shown me the madness of my
conduct, and the dreariness of my hated and hating position.

Something of vengeance I had tasted for the first time; as aromatic
wine it seemed, on swallowing, warm and racy: its after-flavour,
metallic and corroding, gave me a sensation as if I had been poisoned.
Willingly would I now have gone and asked Mrs. Reed’s pardon; but I
knew, partly from experience and partly from instinct, that was the way
to make her repulse me with double scorn, thereby re-exciting every
turbulent impulse of my nature.

I would fain exercise some better faculty than that of fierce speaking;
fain find nourishment for some less fiendish feeling than that of
sombre indignation. I took a book—some Arabian tales; I sat down and
endeavoured to read. I could make no sense of the subject; my own
thoughts swam always between me and the page I had usually found
fascinating. I opened the glass-door in the breakfast-room: the
shrubbery was quite still: the black frost reigned, unbroken by sun or
breeze, through the grounds. I covered my head and arms with the skirt
of my frock, and went out to walk in a part of the plantation which was
quite sequestrated; but I found no pleasure in the silent trees, the
falling fir-cones, the congealed relics of autumn, russet leaves, swept
by past winds in heaps, and now stiffened together. I leaned against a
gate, and looked into an empty field where no sheep were feeding, where
the short grass was nipped and blanched. It was a very grey day; a most
opaque sky, “onding on snaw,” canopied all; thence flakes fell at
intervals, which settled on the hard path and on the hoary lea without
melting. I stood, a wretched child enough, whispering to myself over
and over again, “What shall I do?—what shall I do?”

All at once I heard a clear voice call, “Miss Jane! where are you? Come
to lunch!”

It was Bessie, I knew well enough; but I did not stir; her light step
came tripping down the path.

“You naughty little thing!” she said. “Why don’t you come when you are
called?”

Bessie’s presence, compared with the thoughts over which I had been
brooding, seemed cheerful; even though, as usual, she was somewhat
cross. The fact is, after my conflict with and victory over Mrs. Reed,
I was not disposed to care much for the nursemaid’s transitory anger;
and I _was_ disposed to bask in her youthful lightness of heart. I just
put my two arms round her and said, “Come, Bessie! don’t scold.”

The action was more frank and fearless than any I was habituated to
indulge in: somehow it pleased her.

“You are a strange child, Miss Jane,” she said, as she looked down at
me; “a little roving, solitary thing: and you are going to school, I
suppose?”

I nodded.

“And won’t you be sorry to leave poor Bessie?”

“What does Bessie care for me? She is always scolding me.”

“Because you’re such a queer, frightened, shy little thing. You should
be bolder.”

“What! to get more knocks?”

“Nonsense! But you are rather put upon, that’s certain. My mother said,
when she came to see me last week, that she would not like a little one
of her own to be in your place.—Now, come in, and I’ve some good news
for you.”

“I don’t think you have, Bessie.”

“Child! what do you mean? What sorrowful eyes you fix on me! Well, but
Missis and the young ladies and Master John are going out to tea this
afternoon, and you shall have tea with me. I’ll ask cook to bake you a
little cake, and then you shall help me to look over your drawers; for
I am soon to pack your trunk. Missis intends you to leave Gateshead in
a day or two, and you shall choose what toys you like to take with
you.”

“Bessie, you must promise not to scold me any more till I go.”

“Well, I will; but mind you are a very good girl, and don’t be afraid
of me. Don’t start when I chance to speak rather sharply; it’s so
provoking.”

“I don’t think I shall ever be afraid of you again, Bessie, because I
have got used to you, and I shall soon have another set of people to
dread.”

“If you dread them they’ll dislike you.”

“As you do, Bessie?”

“I don’t dislike you, Miss; I believe I am fonder of you than of all
the others.”

“You don’t show it.”

“You little sharp thing! you’ve got quite a new way of talking. What
makes you so venturesome and hardy?”

“Why, I shall soon be away from you, and besides”—I was going to say
something about what had passed between me and Mrs. Reed, but on second
thoughts I considered it better to remain silent on that head.

“And so you’re glad to leave me?”

“Not at all, Bessie; indeed, just now I’m rather sorry.”

“Just now! and rather! How coolly my little lady says it! I dare say
now if I were to ask you for a kiss you wouldn’t give it me: you’d say
you’d _rather_ not.”

“I’ll kiss you and welcome: bend your head down.” Bessie stooped; we
mutually embraced, and I followed her into the house quite comforted.
That afternoon lapsed in peace and harmony; and in the evening Bessie
told me some of her most enchanting stories, and sang me some of her
sweetest songs. Even for me life had its gleams of sunshine.




CHAPTER V


Five o’clock had hardly struck on the morning of the 19th of January,
when Bessie brought a candle into my closet and found me already up and
nearly dressed. I had risen half-an-hour before her entrance, and had
washed my face, and put on my clothes by the light of a half-moon just
setting, whose rays streamed through the narrow window near my crib. I
was to leave Gateshead that day by a coach which passed the lodge gates
at six A.M. Bessie was the only person yet risen; she had lit a fire in
the nursery, where she now proceeded to make my breakfast. Few children
can eat when excited with the thoughts of a journey; nor could I.
Bessie, having pressed me in vain to take a few spoonfuls of the boiled
milk and bread she had prepared for me, wrapped up some biscuits in a
paper and put them into my bag; then she helped me on with my pelisse
and bonnet, and wrapping herself in a shawl, she and I left the
nursery. As we passed Mrs. Reed’s bedroom, she said, “Will you go in
and bid Missis good-bye?”

“No, Bessie: she came to my crib last night when you were gone down to
supper, and said I need not disturb her in the morning, or my cousins
either; and she told me to remember that she had always been my best
friend, and to speak of her and be grateful to her accordingly.”

“What did you say, Miss?”

“Nothing: I covered my face with the bedclothes, and turned from her to
the wall.”

“That was wrong, Miss Jane.”

“It was quite right, Bessie. Your Missis has not been my friend: she
has been my foe.”

“O Miss Jane! don’t say so!”

“Good-bye to Gateshead!” cried I, as we passed through the hall and
went out at the front door.

The moon was set, and it was very dark; Bessie carried a lantern, whose
light glanced on wet steps and gravel road sodden by a recent thaw. Raw
and chill was the winter morning: my teeth chattered as I hastened down
the drive. There was a light in the porter’s lodge: when we reached it,
we found the porter’s wife just kindling her fire: my trunk, which had
been carried down the evening before, stood corded at the door. It
wanted but a few minutes of six, and shortly after that hour had
struck, the distant roll of wheels announced the coming coach; I went
to the door and watched its lamps approach rapidly through the gloom.

“Is she going by herself?” asked the porter’s wife.

“Yes.”

“And how far is it?”

“Fifty miles.”

“What a long way! I wonder Mrs. Reed is not afraid to trust her so far
alone.”

The coach drew up; there it was at the gates with its four horses and
its top laden with passengers: the guard and coachman loudly urged
haste; my trunk was hoisted up; I was taken from Bessie’s neck, to
which I clung with kisses.

“Be sure and take good care of her,” cried she to the guard, as he
lifted me into the inside.

“Ay, ay!” was the answer: the door was slapped to, a voice exclaimed
“All right,” and on we drove. Thus was I severed from Bessie and
Gateshead; thus whirled away to unknown, and, as I then deemed, remote
and mysterious regions.

I remember but little of the journey; I only know that the day seemed
to me of a preternatural length, and that we appeared to travel over
hundreds of miles of road. We passed through several towns, and in one,
a very large one, the coach stopped; the horses were taken out, and the
passengers alighted to dine. I was carried into an inn, where the guard
wanted me to have some dinner; but, as I had no appetite, he left me in
an immense room with a fireplace at each end, a chandelier pendent from
the ceiling, and a little red gallery high up against the wall filled
with musical instruments. Here I walked about for a long time, feeling
very strange, and mortally apprehensive of some one coming in and
kidnapping me; for I believed in kidnappers, their exploits having
frequently figured in Bessie’s fireside chronicles. At last the guard
returned; once more I was stowed away in the coach, my protector
mounted his own seat, sounded his hollow horn, and away we rattled over
the “stony street” of L——.

The afternoon came on wet and somewhat misty: as it waned into dusk, I
began to feel that we were getting very far indeed from Gateshead: we
ceased to pass through towns; the country changed; great grey hills
heaved up round the horizon: as twilight deepened, we descended a
valley, dark with wood, and long after night had overclouded the
prospect, I heard a wild wind rushing amongst trees.

Lulled by the sound, I at last dropped asleep; I had not long slumbered
when the sudden cessation of motion awoke me; the coach-door was open,
and a person like a servant was standing at it: I saw her face and
dress by the light of the lamps.

“Is there a little girl called Jane Eyre here?” she asked. I answered
“Yes,” and was then lifted out; my trunk was handed down, and the coach
instantly drove away.

I was stiff with long sitting, and bewildered with the noise and motion
of the coach: gathering my faculties, I looked about me. Rain, wind,
and darkness filled the air; nevertheless, I dimly discerned a wall
before me and a door open in it; through this door I passed with my new
guide: she shut and locked it behind her. There was now visible a house
or houses—for the building spread far—with many windows, and lights
burning in some; we went up a broad pebbly path, splashing wet, and
were admitted at a door; then the servant led me through a passage into
a room with a fire, where she left me alone.

I stood and warmed my numbed fingers over the blaze, then I looked
round; there was no candle, but the uncertain light from the hearth
showed, by intervals, papered walls, carpet, curtains, shining mahogany
furniture: it was a parlour, not so spacious or splendid as the
drawing-room at Gateshead, but comfortable enough. I was puzzling to
make out the subject of a picture on the wall, when the door opened,
and an individual carrying a light entered; another followed close
behind.

The first was a tall lady with dark hair, dark eyes, and a pale and
large forehead; her figure was partly enveloped in a shawl, her
countenance was grave, her bearing erect.

“The child is very young to be sent alone,” said she, putting her
candle down on the table. She considered me attentively for a minute or
two, then further added—

“She had better be put to bed soon; she looks tired: are you tired?”
she asked, placing her hand on my shoulder.

“A little, ma’am.”

“And hungry too, no doubt: let her have some supper before she goes to
bed, Miss Miller. Is this the first time you have left your parents to
come to school, my little girl?”

I explained to her that I had no parents. She inquired how long they
had been dead: then how old I was, what was my name, whether I could
read, write, and sew a little: then she touched my cheek gently with
her forefinger, and saying, “She hoped I should be a good child,”
dismissed me along with Miss Miller.

The lady I had left might be about twenty-nine; the one who went with
me appeared some years younger: the first impressed me by her voice,
look, and air. Miss Miller was more ordinary; ruddy in complexion,
though of a careworn countenance; hurried in gait and action, like one
who had always a multiplicity of tasks on hand: she looked, indeed,
what I afterwards found she really was, an under-teacher. Led by her, I
passed from compartment to compartment, from passage to passage, of a
large and irregular building; till, emerging from the total and
somewhat dreary silence pervading that portion of the house we had
traversed, we came upon the hum of many voices, and presently entered a
wide, long room, with great deal tables, two at each end, on each of
which burnt a pair of candles, and seated all round on benches, a
congregation of girls of every age, from nine or ten to twenty. Seen by
the dim light of the dips, their number to me appeared countless,
though not in reality exceeding eighty; they were uniformly dressed in
brown stuff frocks of quaint fashion, and long holland pinafores. It
was the hour of study; they were engaged in conning over their
to-morrow’s task, and the hum I had heard was the combined result of
their whispered repetitions.

Miss Miller signed to me to sit on a bench near the door, then walking
up to the top of the long room she cried out—

“Monitors, collect the lesson-books and put them away!”

Four tall girls arose from different tables, and going round, gathered
the books and removed them. Miss Miller again gave the word of command—

“Monitors, fetch the supper-trays!”

The tall girls went out and returned presently, each bearing a tray,
with portions of something, I knew not what, arranged thereon, and a
pitcher of water and mug in the middle of each tray. The portions were
handed round; those who liked took a draught of the water, the mug
being common to all. When it came to my turn, I drank, for I was
thirsty, but did not touch the food, excitement and fatigue rendering
me incapable of eating: I now saw, however, that it was a thin oaten
cake shared into fragments.

The meal over, prayers were read by Miss Miller, and the classes filed
off, two and two, upstairs. Overpowered by this time with weariness, I
scarcely noticed what sort of a place the bedroom was, except that,
like the schoolroom, I saw it was very long. To-night I was to be Miss
Miller’s bed-fellow; she helped me to undress: when laid down I glanced
at the long rows of beds, each of which was quickly filled with two
occupants; in ten minutes the single light was extinguished, and amidst
silence and complete darkness I fell asleep.

The night passed rapidly: I was too tired even to dream; I only once
awoke to hear the wind rave in furious gusts, and the rain fall in
torrents, and to be sensible that Miss Miller had taken her place by my
side. When I again unclosed my eyes, a loud bell was ringing; the girls
were up and dressing; day had not yet begun to dawn, and a rushlight or
two burned in the room. I too rose reluctantly; it was bitter cold, and
I dressed as well as I could for shivering, and washed when there was a
basin at liberty, which did not occur soon, as there was but one basin
to six girls, on the stands down the middle of the room. Again the bell
rang: all formed in file, two and two, and in that order descended the
stairs and entered the cold and dimly lit schoolroom: here prayers were
read by Miss Miller; afterwards she called out—

“Form classes!”

A great tumult succeeded for some minutes, during which Miss Miller
repeatedly exclaimed, “Silence!” and “Order!” When it subsided, I saw
them all drawn up in four semicircles, before four chairs, placed at
the four tables; all held books in their hands, and a great book, like
a Bible, lay on each table, before the vacant seat. A pause of some
seconds succeeded, filled up by the low, vague hum of numbers; Miss
Miller walked from class to class, hushing this indefinite sound.

A distant bell tinkled: immediately three ladies entered the room, each
walked to a table and took her seat; Miss Miller assumed the fourth
vacant chair, which was that nearest the door, and around which the
smallest of the children were assembled: to this inferior class I was
called, and placed at the bottom of it.

Business now began: the day’s Collect was repeated, then certain texts
of Scripture were said, and to these succeeded a protracted reading of
chapters in the Bible, which lasted an hour. By the time that exercise
was terminated, day had fully dawned. The indefatigable bell now
sounded for the fourth time: the classes were marshalled and marched
into another room to breakfast: how glad I was to behold a prospect of
getting something to eat! I was now nearly sick from inanition, having
taken so little the day before.

The refectory was a great, low-ceiled, gloomy room; on two long tables
smoked basins of something hot, which, however, to my dismay, sent
forth an odour far from inviting. I saw a universal manifestation of
discontent when the fumes of the repast met the nostrils of those
destined to swallow it; from the van of the procession, the tall girls
of the first class, rose the whispered words—

“Disgusting! The porridge is burnt again!”

“Silence!” ejaculated a voice; not that of Miss Miller, but one of the
upper teachers, a little and dark personage, smartly dressed, but of
somewhat morose aspect, who installed herself at the top of one table,
while a more buxom lady presided at the other. I looked in vain for her
I had first seen the night before; she was not visible: Miss Miller
occupied the foot of the table where I sat, and a strange,
foreign-looking, elderly lady, the French teacher, as I afterwards
found, took the corresponding seat at the other board. A long grace was
said and a hymn sung; then a servant brought in some tea for the
teachers, and the meal began.

Ravenous, and now very faint, I devoured a spoonful or two of my
portion without thinking of its taste; but the first edge of hunger
blunted, I perceived I had got in hand a nauseous mess; burnt porridge
is almost as bad as rotten potatoes; famine itself soon sickens over
it. The spoons were moved slowly: I saw each girl taste her food and
try to swallow it; but in most cases the effort was soon relinquished.
Breakfast was over, and none had breakfasted. Thanks being returned for
what we had not got, and a second hymn chanted, the refectory was
evacuated for the schoolroom. I was one of the last to go out, and in
passing the tables, I saw one teacher take a basin of the porridge and
taste it; she looked at the others; all their countenances expressed
displeasure, and one of them, the stout one, whispered—

“Abominable stuff! How shameful!”

A quarter of an hour passed before lessons again began, during which
the schoolroom was in a glorious tumult; for that space of time it
seemed to be permitted to talk loud and more freely, and they used
their privilege. The whole conversation ran on the breakfast, which one
and all abused roundly. Poor things! it was the sole consolation they
had. Miss Miller was now the only teacher in the room: a group of great
girls standing about her spoke with serious and sullen gestures. I
heard the name of Mr. Brocklehurst pronounced by some lips; at which
Miss Miller shook her head disapprovingly; but she made no great effort
to check the general wrath; doubtless she shared in it.

A clock in the schoolroom struck nine; Miss Miller left her circle, and
standing in the middle of the room, cried—

“Silence! To your seats!”

Discipline prevailed: in five minutes the confused throng was resolved
into order, and comparative silence quelled the Babel clamour of
tongues. The upper teachers now punctually resumed their posts: but
still, all seemed to wait. Ranged on benches down the sides of the
room, the eighty girls sat motionless and erect; a quaint assemblage
they appeared, all with plain locks combed from their faces, not a curl
visible; in brown dresses, made high and surrounded by a narrow tucker
about the throat, with little pockets of holland (shaped something like
a Highlander’s purse) tied in front of their frocks, and destined to
serve the purpose of a work-bag: all, too, wearing woollen stockings
and country-made shoes, fastened with brass buckles. Above twenty of
those clad in this costume were full-grown girls, or rather young
women; it suited them ill, and gave an air of oddity even to the
prettiest.

I was still looking at them, and also at intervals examining the
teachers—none of whom precisely pleased me; for the stout one was a
little coarse, the dark one not a little fierce, the foreigner harsh
and grotesque, and Miss Miller, poor thing! looked purple,
weather-beaten, and over-worked—when, as my eye wandered from face to
face, the whole school rose simultaneously, as if moved by a common
spring.

What was the matter? I had heard no order given: I was puzzled. Ere I
had gathered my wits, the classes were again seated: but as all eyes
were now turned to one point, mine followed the general direction, and
encountered the personage who had received me last night. She stood at
the bottom of the long room, on the hearth; for there was a fire at
each end; she surveyed the two rows of girls silently and gravely. Miss
Miller approaching, seemed to ask her a question, and having received
her answer, went back to her place, and said aloud—

“Monitor of the first class, fetch the globes!”

While the direction was being executed, the lady consulted moved slowly
up the room. I suppose I have a considerable organ of veneration, for I
retain yet the sense of admiring awe with which my eyes traced her
steps. Seen now, in broad daylight, she looked tall, fair, and shapely;
brown eyes with a benignant light in their irids, and a fine pencilling
of long lashes round, relieved the whiteness of her large front; on
each of her temples her hair, of a very dark brown, was clustered in
round curls, according to the fashion of those times, when neither
smooth bands nor long ringlets were in vogue; her dress, also in the
mode of the day, was of purple cloth, relieved by a sort of Spanish
trimming of black velvet; a gold watch (watches were not so common then
as now) shone at her girdle. Let the reader add, to complete the
picture, refined features; a complexion, if pale, clear; and a stately
air and carriage, and he will have, at least, as clearly as words can
give it, a correct idea of the exterior of Miss Temple—Maria Temple, as
I afterwards saw the name written in a prayer-book intrusted to me to
carry to church.

The superintendent of Lowood (for such was this lady) having taken her
seat before a pair of globes placed on one of the tables, summoned the
first class round her, and commenced giving a lesson on geography; the
lower classes were called by the teachers: repetitions in history,
grammar, &c., went on for an hour; writing and arithmetic succeeded,
and music lessons were given by Miss Temple to some of the elder girls.
The duration of each lesson was measured by the clock, which at last
struck twelve. The superintendent rose—

“I have a word to address to the pupils,” said she.

The tumult of cessation from lessons was already breaking forth, but it
sank at her voice. She went on—

“You had this morning a breakfast which you could not eat; you must be
hungry:—I have ordered that a lunch of bread and cheese shall be served
to all.”

The teachers looked at her with a sort of surprise.

“It is to be done on my responsibility,” she added, in an explanatory
tone to them, and immediately afterwards left the room.

The bread and cheese was presently brought in and distributed, to the
high delight and refreshment of the whole school. The order was now
given “To the garden!” Each put on a coarse straw bonnet, with strings
of coloured calico, and a cloak of grey frieze. I was similarly
equipped, and, following the stream, I made my way into the open air.

The garden was a wide inclosure, surrounded with walls so high as to
exclude every glimpse of prospect; a covered verandah ran down one
side, and broad walks bordered a middle space divided into scores of
little beds: these beds were assigned as gardens for the pupils to
cultivate, and each bed had an owner. When full of flowers they would
doubtless look pretty; but now, at the latter end of January, all was
wintry blight and brown decay. I shuddered as I stood and looked round
me: it was an inclement day for outdoor exercise; not positively rainy,
but darkened by a drizzling yellow fog; all under foot was still
soaking wet with the floods of yesterday. The stronger among the girls
ran about and engaged in active games, but sundry pale and thin ones
herded together for shelter and warmth in the verandah; and amongst
these, as the dense mist penetrated to their shivering frames, I heard
frequently the sound of a hollow cough.

As yet I had spoken to no one, nor did anybody seem to take notice of
me; I stood lonely enough: but to that feeling of isolation I was
accustomed; it did not oppress me much. I leant against a pillar of the
verandah, drew my grey mantle close about me, and, trying to forget the
cold which nipped me without, and the unsatisfied hunger which gnawed
me within, delivered myself up to the employment of watching and
thinking. My reflections were too undefined and fragmentary to merit
record: I hardly yet knew where I was; Gateshead and my past life
seemed floated away to an immeasurable distance; the present was vague
and strange, and of the future I could form no conjecture. I looked
round the convent-like garden, and then up at the house—a large
building, half of which seemed grey and old, the other half quite new.
The new part, containing the schoolroom and dormitory, was lit by
mullioned and latticed windows, which gave it a church-like aspect; a
stone tablet over the door bore this inscription:—

LOWOOD INSTITUTION.

This portion was rebuilt A.D. ——, by Naomi Brocklehurst,
of Brocklehurst Hall, in this county.

“Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works,
and glorify your Father which is in heaven.”—St. Matt. v. 16.


I read these words over and over again: I felt that an explanation
belonged to them, and was unable fully to penetrate their import. I was
still pondering the signification of “Institution,” and endeavouring to
make out a connection between the first words and the verse of
Scripture, when the sound of a cough close behind me made me turn my
head. I saw a girl sitting on a stone bench near; she was bent over a
book, on the perusal of which she seemed intent: from where I stood I
could see the title—it was “Rasselas;” a name that struck me as
strange, and consequently attractive. In turning a leaf she happened to
look up, and I said to her directly—

“Is your book interesting?” I had already formed the intention of
asking her to lend it to me some day.

“I like it,” she answered, after a pause of a second or two, during
which she examined me.

“What is it about?” I continued. I hardly know where I found the
hardihood thus to open a conversation with a stranger; the step was
contrary to my nature and habits: but I think her occupation touched a
chord of sympathy somewhere; for I too liked reading, though of a
frivolous and childish kind; I could not digest or comprehend the
serious or substantial.

“You may look at it,” replied the girl, offering me the book.

I did so; a brief examination convinced me that the contents were less
taking than the title: “Rasselas” looked dull to my trifling taste; I
saw nothing about fairies, nothing about genii; no bright variety
seemed spread over the closely-printed pages. I returned it to her; she
received it quietly, and without saying anything she was about to
relapse into her former studious mood: again I ventured to disturb her—

“Can you tell me what the writing on that stone over the door means?
What is Lowood Institution?”

“This house where you are come to live.”

“And why do they call it Institution? Is it in any way different from
other schools?”

“It is partly a charity-school: you and I, and all the rest of us, are
charity-children. I suppose you are an orphan: are not either your
father or your mother dead?”

“Both died before I can remember.”

“Well, all the girls here have lost either one or both parents, and
this is called an institution for educating orphans.”

“Do we pay no money? Do they keep us for nothing?”

“We pay, or our friends pay, fifteen pounds a year for each.”

“Then why do they call us charity-children?”

“Because fifteen pounds is not enough for board and teaching, and the
deficiency is supplied by subscription.”

“Who subscribes?”

“Different benevolent-minded ladies and gentlemen in this neighbourhood
and in London.”

“Who was Naomi Brocklehurst?”

“The lady who built the new part of this house as that tablet records,
and whose son overlooks and directs everything here.”

“Why?”

“Because he is treasurer and manager of the establishment.”

“Then this house does not belong to that tall lady who wears a watch,
and who said we were to have some bread and cheese?”

“To Miss Temple? Oh, no! I wish it did: she has to answer to Mr.
Brocklehurst for all she does. Mr. Brocklehurst buys all our food and
all our clothes.”

“Does he live here?”

“No—two miles off, at a large hall.”

“Is he a good man?”

“He is a clergyman, and is said to do a great deal of good.”

“Did you say that tall lady was called Miss Temple?”

“Yes.”

“And what are the other teachers called?”

“The one with red cheeks is called Miss Smith; she attends to the work,
and cuts out—for we make our own clothes, our frocks, and pelisses, and
everything; the little one with black hair is Miss Scatcherd; she
teaches history and grammar, and hears the second class repetitions;
and the one who wears a shawl, and has a pocket-handkerchief tied to
her side with a yellow ribband, is Madame Pierrot: she comes from
Lisle, in France, and teaches French.”

“Do you like the teachers?”

“Well enough.”

“Do you like the little black one, and the Madame ——?—I cannot
pronounce her name as you do.”

“Miss Scatcherd is hasty—you must take care not to offend her; Madame
Pierrot is not a bad sort of person.”

“But Miss Temple is the best—isn’t she?”

“Miss Temple is very good and very clever; she is above the rest,
because she knows far more than they do.”

“Have you been long here?”

“Two years.”

“Are you an orphan?”

“My mother is dead.”

“Are you happy here?”

“You ask rather too many questions. I have given you answers enough for
the present: now I want to read.”

But at that moment the summons sounded for dinner; all re-entered the
house. The odour which now filled the refectory was scarcely more
appetising than that which had regaled our nostrils at breakfast: the
dinner was served in two huge tin-plated vessels, whence rose a strong
steam redolent of rancid fat. I found the mess to consist of
indifferent potatoes and strange shreds of rusty meat, mixed and cooked
together. Of this preparation a tolerably abundant plateful was
apportioned to each pupil. I ate what I could, and wondered within
myself whether every day’s fare would be like this.

After dinner, we immediately adjourned to the schoolroom: lessons
recommenced, and were continued till five o’clock.

The only marked event of the afternoon was, that I saw the girl with
whom I had conversed in the verandah dismissed in disgrace by Miss
Scatcherd from a history class, and sent to stand in the middle of the
large schoolroom. The punishment seemed to me in a high degree
ignominious, especially for so great a girl—she looked thirteen or
upwards. I expected she would show signs of great distress and shame;
but to my surprise she neither wept nor blushed: composed, though
grave, she stood, the central mark of all eyes. “How can she bear it so
quietly—so firmly?” I asked of myself. “Were I in her place, it seems
to me I should wish the earth to open and swallow me up. She looks as
if she were thinking of something beyond her punishment—beyond her
situation: of something not round her nor before her. I have heard of
day-dreams—is she in a day-dream now? Her eyes are fixed on the floor,
but I am sure they do not see it—her sight seems turned in, gone down
into her heart: she is looking at what she can remember, I believe; not
at what is really present. I wonder what sort of a girl she is—whether
good or naughty.”

Soon after five P.M. we had another meal, consisting of a small mug of
coffee, and half-a-slice of brown bread. I devoured my bread and drank
my coffee with relish; but I should have been glad of as much more—I
was still hungry. Half-an-hour’s recreation succeeded, then study; then
the glass of water and the piece of oat-cake, prayers, and bed. Such
was my first day at Lowood.




CHAPTER VI


The next day commenced as before, getting up and dressing by rushlight;
but this morning we were obliged to dispense with the ceremony of
washing; the water in the pitchers was frozen. A change had taken place
in the weather the preceding evening, and a keen north-east wind,
whistling through the crevices of our bedroom windows all night long,
had made us shiver in our beds, and turned the contents of the ewers to
ice.

Before the long hour and a half of prayers and Bible-reading was over,
I felt ready to perish with cold. Breakfast-time came at last, and this
morning the porridge was not burnt; the quality was eatable, the
quantity small. How small my portion seemed! I wished it had been
doubled.

In the course of the day I was enrolled a member of the fourth class,
and regular tasks and occupations were assigned me: hitherto, I had
only been a spectator of the proceedings at Lowood; I was now to become
an actor therein. At first, being little accustomed to learn by heart,
the lessons appeared to me both long and difficult; the frequent change
from task to task, too, bewildered me; and I was glad when, about three
o’clock in the afternoon, Miss Smith put into my hands a border of
muslin two yards long, together with needle, thimble, &c., and sent me
to sit in a quiet corner of the schoolroom, with directions to hem the
same. At that hour most of the others were sewing likewise; but one
class still stood round Miss Scatcherd’s chair reading, and as all was
quiet, the subject of their lessons could be heard, together with the
manner in which each girl acquitted herself, and the animadversions or
commendations of Miss Scatcherd on the performance. It was English
history: among the readers I observed my acquaintance of the verandah:
at the commencement of the lesson, her place had been at the top of the
class, but for some error of pronunciation, or some inattention to
stops, she was suddenly sent to the very bottom. Even in that obscure
position, Miss Scatcherd continued to make her an object of constant
notice: she was continually addressing to her such phrases as the
following:—

“Burns” (such it seems was her name: the girls here were all called by
their surnames, as boys are elsewhere), “Burns, you are standing on the
side of your shoe; turn your toes out immediately.” “Burns, you poke
your chin most unpleasantly; draw it in.” “Burns, I insist on your
holding your head up; I will not have you before me in that attitude,”
&c. &c.

A chapter having been read through twice, the books were closed and the
girls examined. The lesson had comprised part of the reign of Charles
I., and there were sundry questions about tonnage and poundage and
ship-money, which most of them appeared unable to answer; still, every
little difficulty was solved instantly when it reached Burns: her
memory seemed to have retained the substance of the whole lesson, and
she was ready with answers on every point. I kept expecting that Miss
Scatcherd would praise her attention; but, instead of that, she
suddenly cried out—

“You dirty, disagreeable girl! you have never cleaned your nails this
morning!”

Burns made no answer: I wondered at her silence.

“Why,” thought I, “does she not explain that she could neither clean
her nails nor wash her face, as the water was frozen?”

My attention was now called off by Miss Smith desiring me to hold a
skein of thread: while she was winding it, she talked to me from time
to time, asking whether I had ever been at school before, whether I
could mark, stitch, knit, &c.; till she dismissed me, I could not
pursue my observations on Miss Scatcherd’s movements. When I returned
to my seat, that lady was just delivering an order of which I did not
catch the import; but Burns immediately left the class, and going into
the small inner room where the books were kept, returned in half a
minute, carrying in her hand a bundle of twigs tied together at one
end. This ominous tool she presented to Miss Scatcherd with a
respectful curtesy; then she quietly, and without being told, unloosed
her pinafore, and the teacher instantly and sharply inflicted on her
neck a dozen strokes with the bunch of twigs. Not a tear rose to Burns’
eye; and, while I paused from my sewing, because my fingers quivered at
this spectacle with a sentiment of unavailing and impotent anger, not a
feature of her pensive face altered its ordinary expression.

“Hardened girl!” exclaimed Miss Scatcherd; “nothing can correct you of
your slatternly habits: carry the rod away.”

Burns obeyed: I looked at her narrowly as she emerged from the
book-closet; she was just putting back her handkerchief into her
pocket, and the trace of a tear glistened on her thin cheek.

The play-hour in the evening I thought the pleasantest fraction of the
day at Lowood: the bit of bread, the draught of coffee swallowed at
five o’clock had revived vitality, if it had not satisfied hunger: the
long restraint of the day was slackened; the schoolroom felt warmer
than in the morning—its fires being allowed to burn a little more
brightly, to supply, in some measure, the place of candles, not yet
introduced: the ruddy gloaming, the licensed uproar, the confusion of
many voices gave one a welcome sense of liberty.

On the evening of the day on which I had seen Miss Scatcherd flog her
pupil, Burns, I wandered as usual among the forms and tables and
laughing groups without a companion, yet not feeling lonely: when I
passed the windows, I now and then lifted a blind, and looked out; it
snowed fast, a drift was already forming against the lower panes;
putting my ear close to the window, I could distinguish from the
gleeful tumult within, the disconsolate moan of the wind outside.

Probably, if I had lately left a good home and kind parents, this would
have been the hour when I should most keenly have regretted the
separation; that wind would then have saddened my heart; this obscure
chaos would have disturbed my peace! as it was, I derived from both a
strange excitement, and reckless and feverish, I wished the wind to
howl more wildly, the gloom to deepen to darkness, and the confusion to
rise to clamour.

Jumping over forms, and creeping under tables, I made my way to one of
the fire-places; there, kneeling by the high wire fender, I found
Burns, absorbed, silent, abstracted from all round her by the
companionship of a book, which she read by the dim glare of the embers.

“Is it still ‘Rasselas’?” I asked, coming behind her.

“Yes,” she said, “and I have just finished it.”

And in five minutes more she shut it up. I was glad of this.

“Now,” thought I, “I can perhaps get her to talk.” I sat down by her on
the floor.

“What is your name besides Burns?”

“Helen.”

“Do you come a long way from here?”

“I come from a place farther north, quite on the borders of Scotland.”

“Will you ever go back?”

“I hope so; but nobody can be sure of the future.”

“You must wish to leave Lowood?”

“No! why should I? I was sent to Lowood to get an education; and it
would be of no use going away until I have attained that object.”

“But that teacher, Miss Scatcherd, is so cruel to you?”

“Cruel? Not at all! She is severe: she dislikes my faults.”

“And if I were in your place I should dislike her; I should resist her.
If she struck me with that rod, I should get it from her hand; I should
break it under her nose.”

“Probably you would do nothing of the sort: but if you did, Mr.
Brocklehurst would expel you from the school; that would be a great
grief to your relations. It is far better to endure patiently a smart
which nobody feels but yourself, than to commit a hasty action whose
evil consequences will extend to all connected with you; and besides,
the Bible bids us return good for evil.”

“But then it seems disgraceful to be flogged, and to be sent to stand
in the middle of a room full of people; and you are such a great girl:
I am far younger than you, and I could not bear it.”

“Yet it would be your duty to bear it, if you could not avoid it: it is
weak and silly to say you _cannot bear_ what it is your fate to be
required to bear.”

I heard her with wonder: I could not comprehend this doctrine of
endurance; and still less could I understand or sympathise with the
forbearance she expressed for her chastiser. Still I felt that Helen
Burns considered things by a light invisible to my eyes. I suspected
she might be right and I wrong; but I would not ponder the matter
deeply; like Felix, I put it off to a more convenient season.

“You say you have faults, Helen: what are they? To me you seem very
good.”

“Then learn from me, not to judge by appearances: I am, as Miss
Scatcherd said, slatternly; I seldom put, and never keep, things in
order; I am careless; I forget rules; I read when I should learn my
lessons; I have no method; and sometimes I say, like you, I cannot
_bear_ to be subjected to systematic arrangements. This is all very
provoking to Miss Scatcherd, who is naturally neat, punctual, and
particular.”

“And cross and cruel,” I added; but Helen Burns would not admit my
addition: she kept silence.

“Is Miss Temple as severe to you as Miss Scatcherd?”

At the utterance of Miss Temple’s name, a soft smile flitted over her
grave face.

“Miss Temple is full of goodness; it pains her to be severe to any one,
even the worst in the school: she sees my errors, and tells me of them
gently; and, if I do anything worthy of praise, she gives me my meed
liberally. One strong proof of my wretchedly defective nature is, that
even her expostulations, so mild, so rational, have not influence to
cure me of my faults; and even her praise, though I value it most
highly, cannot stimulate me to continued care and foresight.”

“That is curious,” said I, “it is so easy to be careful.”

“For _you_ I have no doubt it is. I observed you in your class this
morning, and saw you were closely attentive: your thoughts never seemed
to wander while Miss Miller explained the lesson and questioned you.
Now, mine continually rove away; when I should be listening to Miss
Scatcherd, and collecting all she says with assiduity, often I lose the
very sound of her voice; I fall into a sort of dream. Sometimes I think
I am in Northumberland, and that the noises I hear round me are the
bubbling of a little brook which runs through Deepden, near our
house;—then, when it comes to my turn to reply, I have to be awakened;
and having heard nothing of what was read for listening to the
visionary brook, I have no answer ready.”

“Yet how well you replied this afternoon.”

“It was mere chance; the subject on which we had been reading had
interested me. This afternoon, instead of dreaming of Deepden, I was
wondering how a man who wished to do right could act so unjustly and
unwisely as Charles the First sometimes did; and I thought what a pity
it was that, with his integrity and conscientiousness, he could see no
farther than the prerogatives of the crown. If he had but been able to
look to a distance, and see how what they call the spirit of the age
was tending! Still, I like Charles—I respect him—I pity him, poor
murdered king! Yes, his enemies were the worst: they shed blood they
had no right to shed. How dared they kill him!”

Helen was talking to herself now: she had forgotten I could not very
well understand her—that I was ignorant, or nearly so, of the subject
she discussed. I recalled her to my level.

“And when Miss Temple teaches you, do your thoughts wander then?”

“No, certainly, not often; because Miss Temple has generally something
to say which is newer than my own reflections; her language is
singularly agreeable to me, and the information she communicates is
often just what I wished to gain.”

“Well, then, with Miss Temple you are good?”

“Yes, in a passive way: I make no effort; I follow as inclination
guides me. There is no merit in such goodness.”

“A great deal: you are good to those who are good to you. It is all I
ever desire to be. If people were always kind and obedient to those who
are cruel and unjust, the wicked people would have it all their own
way: they would never feel afraid, and so they would never alter, but
would grow worse and worse. When we are struck at without a reason, we
should strike back again very hard; I am sure we should—so hard as to
teach the person who struck us never to do it again.”

“You will change your mind, I hope, when you grow older: as yet you are
but a little untaught girl.”

“But I feel this, Helen; I must dislike those who, whatever I do to
please them, persist in disliking me; I must resist those who punish me
unjustly. It is as natural as that I should love those who show me
affection, or submit to punishment when I feel it is deserved.”

“Heathens and savage tribes hold that doctrine, but Christians and
civilised nations disown it.”

“How? I don’t understand.”

“It is not violence that best overcomes hate—nor vengeance that most
certainly heals injury.”

“What then?”

“Read the New Testament, and observe what Christ says, and how He acts;
make His word your rule, and His conduct your example.”

“What does He say?”

“Love your enemies; bless them that curse you; do good to them that
hate you and despitefully use you.”

“Then I should love Mrs. Reed, which I cannot do; I should bless her
son John, which is impossible.”

In her turn, Helen Burns asked me to explain, and I proceeded forthwith
to pour out, in my own way, the tale of my sufferings and resentments.
Bitter and truculent when excited, I spoke as I felt, without reserve
or softening.

Helen heard me patiently to the end: I expected she would then make a
remark, but she said nothing.

“Well,” I asked impatiently, “is not Mrs. Reed a hard-hearted, bad
woman?”

“She has been unkind to you, no doubt; because you see, she dislikes
your cast of character, as Miss Scatcherd does mine; but how minutely
you remember all she has done and said to you! What a singularly deep
impression her injustice seems to have made on your heart! No ill-usage
so brands its record on my feelings. Would you not be happier if you
tried to forget her severity, together with the passionate emotions it
excited? Life appears to me too short to be spent in nursing animosity
or registering wrongs. We are, and must be, one and all, burdened with
faults in this world: but the time will soon come when, I trust, we
shall put them off in putting off our corruptible bodies; when
debasement and sin will fall from us with this cumbrous frame of flesh,
and only the spark of the spirit will remain,—the impalpable principle
of light and thought, pure as when it left the Creator to inspire the
creature: whence it came it will return; perhaps again to be
communicated to some being higher than man—perhaps to pass through
gradations of glory, from the pale human soul to brighten to the
seraph! Surely it will never, on the contrary, be suffered to
degenerate from man to fiend? No; I cannot believe that: I hold another
creed: which no one ever taught me, and which I seldom mention; but in
which I delight, and to which I cling: for it extends hope to all: it
makes Eternity a rest—a mighty home, not a terror and an abyss.
Besides, with this creed, I can so clearly distinguish between the
criminal and his crime; I can so sincerely forgive the first while I
abhor the last: with this creed revenge never worries my heart,
degradation never too deeply disgusts me, injustice never crushes me
too low: I live in calm, looking to the end.”

Helen’s head, always drooping, sank a little lower as she finished this
sentence. I saw by her look she wished no longer to talk to me, but
rather to converse with her own thoughts. She was not allowed much time
for meditation: a monitor, a great rough girl, presently came up,
exclaiming in a strong Cumberland accent—

“Helen Burns, if you don’t go and put your drawer in order, and fold up
your work this minute, I’ll tell Miss Scatcherd to come and look at
it!”

Helen sighed as her reverie fled, and getting up, obeyed the monitor
without reply as without delay.




CHAPTER VII


My first quarter at Lowood seemed an age; and not the golden age
either; it comprised an irksome struggle with difficulties in
habituating myself to new rules and unwonted tasks. The fear of failure
in these points harassed me worse than the physical hardships of my
lot; though these were no trifles.

During January, February, and part of March, the deep snows, and, after
their melting, the almost impassable roads, prevented our stirring
beyond the garden walls, except to go to church; but within these
limits we had to pass an hour every day in the open air. Our clothing
was insufficient to protect us from the severe cold: we had no boots,
the snow got into our shoes and melted there: our ungloved hands became
numbed and covered with chilblains, as were our feet: I remember well
the distracting irritation I endured from this cause every evening,
when my feet inflamed; and the torture of thrusting the swelled, raw,
and stiff toes into my shoes in the morning. Then the scanty supply of
food was distressing: with the keen appetites of growing children, we
had scarcely sufficient to keep alive a delicate invalid. From this
deficiency of nourishment resulted an abuse, which pressed hardly on
the younger pupils: whenever the famished great girls had an
opportunity, they would coax or menace the little ones out of their
portion. Many a time I have shared between two claimants the precious
morsel of brown bread distributed at tea-time; and after relinquishing
to a third half the contents of my mug of coffee, I have swallowed the
remainder with an accompaniment of secret tears, forced from me by the
exigency of hunger.

Sundays were dreary days in that wintry season. We had to walk two
miles to Brocklebridge Church, where our patron officiated. We set out
cold, we arrived at church colder: during the morning service we became
almost paralysed. It was too far to return to dinner, and an allowance
of cold meat and bread, in the same penurious proportion observed in
our ordinary meals, was served round between the services.

At the close of the afternoon service we returned by an exposed and
hilly road, where the bitter winter wind, blowing over a range of snowy
summits to the north, almost flayed the skin from our faces.

I can remember Miss Temple walking lightly and rapidly along our
drooping line, her plaid cloak, which the frosty wind fluttered,
gathered close about her, and encouraging us, by precept and example,
to keep up our spirits, and march forward, as she said, “like stalwart
soldiers.” The other teachers, poor things, were generally themselves
too much dejected to attempt the task of cheering others.

How we longed for the light and heat of a blazing fire when we got
back! But, to the little ones at least, this was denied: each hearth in
the schoolroom was immediately surrounded by a double row of great
girls, and behind them the younger children crouched in groups,
wrapping their starved arms in their pinafores.

A little solace came at tea-time, in the shape of a double ration of
bread—a whole, instead of a half, slice—with the delicious addition of
a thin scrape of butter: it was the hebdomadal treat to which we all
looked forward from Sabbath to Sabbath. I generally contrived to
reserve a moiety of this bounteous repast for myself; but the remainder
I was invariably obliged to part with.

The Sunday evening was spent in repeating, by heart, the Church
Catechism, and the fifth, sixth, and seventh chapters of St. Matthew;
and in listening to a long sermon, read by Miss Miller, whose
irrepressible yawns attested her weariness. A frequent interlude of
these performances was the enactment of the part of Eutychus by some
half-dozen of little girls, who, overpowered with sleep, would fall
down, if not out of the third loft, yet off the fourth form, and be
taken up half dead. The remedy was, to thrust them forward into the
centre of the schoolroom, and oblige them to stand there till the
sermon was finished. Sometimes their feet failed them, and they sank
together in a heap; they were then propped up with the monitors’ high
stools.

I have not yet alluded to the visits of Mr. Brocklehurst; and indeed
that gentleman was from home during the greater part of the first month
after my arrival; perhaps prolonging his stay with his friend the
archdeacon: his absence was a relief to me. I need not say that I had
my own reasons for dreading his coming: but come he did at last.

One afternoon (I had then been three weeks at Lowood), as I was sitting
with a slate in my hand, puzzling over a sum in long division, my eyes,
raised in abstraction to the window, caught sight of a figure just
passing: I recognised almost instinctively that gaunt outline; and
when, two minutes after, all the school, teachers included, rose _en
masse_, it was not necessary for me to look up in order to ascertain
whose entrance they thus greeted. A long stride measured the
schoolroom, and presently beside Miss Temple, who herself had risen,
stood the same black column which had frowned on me so ominously from
the hearthrug of Gateshead. I now glanced sideways at this piece of
architecture. Yes, I was right: it was Mr. Brocklehurst, buttoned up in
a surtout, and looking longer, narrower, and more rigid than ever.

I had my own reasons for being dismayed at this apparition; too well I
remembered the perfidious hints given by Mrs. Reed about my
disposition, &c.; the promise pledged by Mr. Brocklehurst to apprise
Miss Temple and the teachers of my vicious nature. All along I had been
dreading the fulfilment of this promise,—I had been looking out daily
for the “Coming Man,” whose information respecting my past life and
conversation was to brand me as a bad child for ever: now there he was.

He stood at Miss Temple’s side; he was speaking low in her ear: I did
not doubt he was making disclosures of my villainy; and I watched her
eye with painful anxiety, expecting every moment to see its dark orb
turn on me a glance of repugnance and contempt. I listened too; and as
I happened to be seated quite at the top of the room, I caught most of
what he said: its import relieved me from immediate apprehension.

“I suppose, Miss Temple, the thread I bought at Lowton will do; it
struck me that it would be just of the quality for the calico chemises,
and I sorted the needles to match. You may tell Miss Smith that I
forgot to make a memorandum of the darning needles, but she shall have
some papers sent in next week; and she is not, on any account, to give
out more than one at a time to each pupil: if they have more, they are
apt to be careless and lose them. And, O ma’am! I wish the woollen
stockings were better looked to!—when I was here last, I went into the
kitchen-garden and examined the clothes drying on the line; there was a
quantity of black hose in a very bad state of repair: from the size of
the holes in them I was sure they had not been well mended from time to
time.”

He paused.

“Your directions shall be attended to, sir,” said Miss Temple.

“And, ma’am,” he continued, “the laundress tells me some of the girls
have two clean tuckers in the week: it is too much; the rules limit
them to one.”

“I think I can explain that circumstance, sir. Agnes and Catherine
Johnstone were invited to take tea with some friends at Lowton last
Thursday, and I gave them leave to put on clean tuckers for the
occasion.”

Mr. Brocklehurst nodded.

“Well, for once it may pass; but please not to let the circumstance
occur too often. And there is another thing which surprised me; I find,
in settling accounts with the housekeeper, that a lunch, consisting of
bread and cheese, has twice been served out to the girls during the
past fortnight. How is this? I looked over the regulations, and I find
no such meal as lunch mentioned. Who introduced this innovation? and by
what authority?”

“I must be responsible for the circumstance, sir,” replied Miss Temple:
“the breakfast was so ill prepared that the pupils could not possibly
eat it; and I dared not allow them to remain fasting till dinner-time.”

“Madam, allow me an instant. You are aware that my plan in bringing up
these girls is, not to accustom them to habits of luxury and
indulgence, but to render them hardy, patient, self-denying. Should any
little accidental disappointment of the appetite occur, such as the
spoiling of a meal, the under or the over dressing of a dish, the
incident ought not to be neutralised by replacing with something more
delicate the comfort lost, thus pampering the body and obviating the
aim of this institution; it ought to be improved to the spiritual
edification of the pupils, by encouraging them to evince fortitude
under the temporary privation. A brief address on those occasions would
not be mistimed, wherein a judicious instructor would take the
opportunity of referring to the sufferings of the primitive Christians;
to the torments of martyrs; to the exhortations of our blessed Lord
Himself, calling upon His disciples to take up their cross and follow
Him; to His warnings that man shall not live by bread alone, but by
every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God; to His divine
consolations, ‘If ye suffer hunger or thirst for My sake, happy are
ye.’ Oh, madam, when you put bread and cheese, instead of burnt
porridge, into these children’s mouths, you may indeed feed their vile
bodies, but you little think how you starve their immortal souls!”

Mr. Brocklehurst again paused—perhaps overcome by his feelings. Miss
Temple had looked down when he first began to speak to her; but she now
gazed straight before her, and her face, naturally pale as marble,
appeared to be assuming also the coldness and fixity of that material;
especially her mouth, closed as if it would have required a sculptor’s
chisel to open it, and her brow settled gradually into petrified
severity.

Meantime, Mr. Brocklehurst, standing on the hearth with his hands
behind his back, majestically surveyed the whole school. Suddenly his
eye gave a blink, as if it had met something that either dazzled or
shocked its pupil; turning, he said in more rapid accents than he had
hitherto used—

“Miss Temple, Miss Temple, what—_what_ is that girl with curled hair?
Red hair, ma’am, curled—curled all over?” And extending his cane he
pointed to the awful object, his hand shaking as he did so.

“It is Julia Severn,” replied Miss Temple, very quietly.

“Julia Severn, ma’am! And why has she, or any other, curled hair? Why,
in defiance of every precept and principle of this house, does she
conform to the world so openly—here in an evangelical, charitable
establishment—as to wear her hair one mass of curls?”

“Julia’s hair curls naturally,” returned Miss Temple, still more
quietly.

“Naturally! Yes, but we are not to conform to nature; I wish these
girls to be the children of Grace: and why that abundance? I have again
and again intimated that I desire the hair to be arranged closely,
modestly, plainly. Miss Temple, that girl’s hair must be cut off
entirely; I will send a barber to-morrow: and I see others who have far
too much of the excrescence—that tall girl, tell her to turn round.
Tell all the first form to rise up and direct their faces to the wall.”

Miss Temple passed her handkerchief over her lips, as if to smooth away
the involuntary smile that curled them; she gave the order, however,
and when the first class could take in what was required of them, they
obeyed. Leaning a little back on my bench, I could see the looks and
grimaces with which they commented on this manoeuvre: it was a pity Mr.
Brocklehurst could not see them too; he would perhaps have felt that,
whatever he might do with the outside of the cup and platter, the
inside was further beyond his interference than he imagined.

He scrutinised the reverse of these living medals some five minutes,
then pronounced sentence. These words fell like the knell of doom—

“All those top-knots must be cut off.”

Miss Temple seemed to remonstrate.

“Madam,” he pursued, “I have a Master to serve whose kingdom is not of
this world: my mission is to mortify in these girls the lusts of the
flesh; to teach them to clothe themselves with shame-facedness and
sobriety, not with braided hair and costly apparel; and each of the
young persons before us has a string of hair twisted in plaits which
vanity itself might have woven; these, I repeat, must be cut off; think
of the time wasted, of—”

Mr. Brocklehurst was here interrupted: three other visitors, ladies,
now entered the room. They ought to have come a little sooner to have
heard his lecture on dress, for they were splendidly attired in velvet,
silk, and furs. The two younger of the trio (fine girls of sixteen and
seventeen) had grey beaver hats, then in fashion, shaded with ostrich
plumes, and from under the brim of this graceful head-dress fell a
profusion of light tresses, elaborately curled; the elder lady was
enveloped in a costly velvet shawl, trimmed with ermine, and she wore a
false front of French curls.

These ladies were deferentially received by Miss Temple, as Mrs. and
the Misses Brocklehurst, and conducted to seats of honour at the top of
the room. It seems they had come in the carriage with their reverend
relative, and had been conducting a rummaging scrutiny of the room
upstairs, while he transacted business with the housekeeper, questioned
the laundress, and lectured the superintendent. They now proceeded to
address divers remarks and reproofs to Miss Smith, who was charged with
the care of the linen and the inspection of the dormitories: but I had
no time to listen to what they said; other matters called off and
enchanted my attention.

Hitherto, while gathering up the discourse of Mr. Brocklehurst and Miss
Temple, I had not, at the same time, neglected precautions to secure my
personal safety; which I thought would be effected, if I could only
elude observation. To this end, I had sat well back on the form, and
while seeming to be busy with my sum, had held my slate in such a
manner as to conceal my face: I might have escaped notice, had not my
treacherous slate somehow happened to slip from my hand, and falling
with an obtrusive crash, directly drawn every eye upon me; I knew it
was all over now, and, as I stooped to pick up the two fragments of
slate, I rallied my forces for the worst. It came.

“A careless girl!” said Mr. Brocklehurst, and immediately after—“It is
the new pupil, I perceive.” And before I could draw breath, “I must not
forget I have a word to say respecting her.” Then aloud: how loud it
seemed to me! “Let the child who broke her slate come forward!”

Of my own accord I could not have stirred; I was paralysed: but the two
great girls who sat on each side of me, set me on my legs and pushed me
towards the dread judge, and then Miss Temple gently assisted me to his
very feet, and I caught her whispered counsel—

“Don’t be afraid, Jane, I saw it was an accident; you shall not be
punished.”

The kind whisper went to my heart like a dagger.

“Another minute, and she will despise me for a hypocrite,” thought I;
and an impulse of fury against Reed, Brocklehurst, and Co. bounded in
my pulses at the conviction. I was no Helen Burns.

“Fetch that stool,” said Mr. Brocklehurst, pointing to a very high one
from which a monitor had just risen: it was brought.

“Place the child upon it.”

And I was placed there, by whom I don’t know: I was in no condition to
note particulars; I was only aware that they had hoisted me up to the
height of Mr. Brocklehurst’s nose, that he was within a yard of me, and
that a spread of shot orange and purple silk pelisses and a cloud of
silvery plumage extended and waved below me.

Mr. Brocklehurst hemmed.

“Ladies,” said he, turning to his family, “Miss Temple, teachers, and
children, you all see this girl?”

Of course they did; for I felt their eyes directed like burning-glasses
against my scorched skin.

“You see she is yet young; you observe she possesses the ordinary form
of childhood; God has graciously given her the shape that He has given
to all of us; no signal deformity points her out as a marked character.
Who would think that the Evil One had already found a servant and agent
in her? Yet such, I grieve to say, is the case.”

A pause—in which I began to steady the palsy of my nerves, and to feel
that the Rubicon was passed; and that the trial, no longer to be
shirked, must be firmly sustained.

“My dear children,” pursued the black marble clergyman, with pathos,
“this is a sad, a melancholy occasion; for it becomes my duty to warn
you, that this girl, who might be one of God’s own lambs, is a little
castaway: not a member of the true flock, but evidently an interloper
and an alien. You must be on your guard against her; you must shun her
example; if necessary, avoid her company, exclude her from your sports,
and shut her out from your converse. Teachers, you must watch her: keep
your eyes on her movements, weigh well her words, scrutinise her
actions, punish her body to save her soul: if, indeed, such salvation
be possible, for (my tongue falters while I tell it) this girl, this
child, the native of a Christian land, worse than many a little heathen
who says its prayers to Brahma and kneels before Juggernaut—this girl
is—a liar!”

Now came a pause of ten minutes, during which I, by this time in
perfect possession of my wits, observed all the female Brocklehursts
produce their pocket-handkerchiefs and apply them to their optics,
while the elderly lady swayed herself to and fro, and the two younger
ones whispered, “How shocking!”

Mr. Brocklehurst resumed.

“This I learned from her benefactress; from the pious and charitable
lady who adopted her in her orphan state, reared her as her own
daughter, and whose kindness, whose generosity the unhappy girl repaid
by an ingratitude so bad, so dreadful, that at last her excellent
patroness was obliged to separate her from her own young ones, fearful
lest her vicious example should contaminate their purity: she has sent
her here to be healed, even as the Jews of old sent their diseased to
the troubled pool of Bethesda; and, teachers, superintendent, I beg of
you not to allow the waters to stagnate round her.”

With this sublime conclusion, Mr. Brocklehurst adjusted the top button
of his surtout, muttered something to his family, who rose, bowed to
Miss Temple, and then all the great people sailed in state from the
room. Turning at the door, my judge said—

“Let her stand half-an-hour longer on that stool, and let no one speak
to her during the remainder of the day.”

There was I, then, mounted aloft; I, who had said I could not bear the
shame of standing on my natural feet in the middle of the room, was now
exposed to general view on a pedestal of infamy. What my sensations
were, no language can describe; but just as they all rose, stifling my
breath and constricting my throat, a girl came up and passed me: in
passing, she lifted her eyes. What a strange light inspired them! What
an extraordinary sensation that ray sent through me! How the new
feeling bore me up! It was as if a martyr, a hero, had passed a slave
or victim, and imparted strength in the transit. I mastered the rising
hysteria, lifted up my head, and took a firm stand on the stool. Helen
Burns asked some slight question about her work of Miss Smith, was
chidden for the triviality of the inquiry, returned to her place, and
smiled at me as she again went by. What a smile! I remember it now, and
I know that it was the effluence of fine intellect, of true courage; it
lit up her marked lineaments, her thin face, her sunken grey eye, like
a reflection from the aspect of an angel. Yet at that moment Helen
Burns wore on her arm “the untidy badge;” scarcely an hour ago I had
heard her condemned by Miss Scatcherd to a dinner of bread and water on
the morrow because she had blotted an exercise in copying it out. Such
is the imperfect nature of man! such spots are there on the disc of the
clearest planet; and eyes like Miss Scatcherd’s can only see those
minute defects, and are blind to the full brightness of the orb.




CHAPTER VIII


Ere the half-hour ended, five o’clock struck; school was dismissed, and
all were gone into the refectory to tea. I now ventured to descend: it
was deep dusk; I retired into a corner and sat down on the floor. The
spell by which I had been so far supported began to dissolve; reaction
took place, and soon, so overwhelming was the grief that seized me, I
sank prostrate with my face to the ground. Now I wept: Helen Burns was
not here; nothing sustained me; left to myself I abandoned myself, and
my tears watered the boards. I had meant to be so good, and to do so
much at Lowood: to make so many friends, to earn respect and win
affection. Already I had made visible progress: that very morning I had
reached the head of my class; Miss Miller had praised me warmly; Miss
Temple had smiled approbation; she had promised to teach me drawing,
and to let me learn French, if I continued to make similar improvement
two months longer: and then I was well received by my fellow-pupils;
treated as an equal by those of my own age, and not molested by any;
now, here I lay again crushed and trodden on; and could I ever rise
more?

“Never,” I thought; and ardently I wished to die. While sobbing out
this wish in broken accents, some one approached: I started up—again
Helen Burns was near me; the fading fires just showed her coming up the
long, vacant room; she brought my coffee and bread.

“Come, eat something,” she said; but I put both away from me, feeling
as if a drop or a crumb would have choked me in my present condition.
Helen regarded me, probably with surprise: I could not now abate my
agitation, though I tried hard; I continued to weep aloud. She sat down
on the ground near me, embraced her knees with her arms, and rested her
head upon them; in that attitude she remained silent as an Indian. I
was the first who spoke—

“Helen, why do you stay with a girl whom everybody believes to be a
liar?”

“Everybody, Jane? Why, there are only eighty people who have heard you
called so, and the world contains hundreds of millions.”

“But what have I to do with millions? The eighty, I know, despise me.”

“Jane, you are mistaken: probably not one in the school either despises
or dislikes you: many, I am sure, pity you much.”

“How can they pity me after what Mr. Brocklehurst has said?”

“Mr. Brocklehurst is not a god: nor is he even a great and admired man:
he is little liked here; he never took steps to make himself liked. Had
he treated you as an especial favourite, you would have found enemies,
declared or covert, all around you; as it is, the greater number would
offer you sympathy if they dared. Teachers and pupils may look coldly
on you for a day or two, but friendly feelings are concealed in their
hearts; and if you persevere in doing well, these feelings will ere
long appear so much the more evidently for their temporary suppression.
Besides, Jane”—she paused.

“Well, Helen?” said I, putting my hand into hers: she chafed my fingers
gently to warm them, and went on—

“If all the world hated you, and believed you wicked, while your own
conscience approved you, and absolved you from guilt, you would not be
without friends.”

“No; I know I should think well of myself; but that is not enough: if
others don’t love me I would rather die than live—I cannot bear to be
solitary and hated, Helen. Look here; to gain some real affection from
you, or Miss Temple, or any other whom I truly love, I would willingly
submit to have the bone of my arm broken, or to let a bull toss me, or
to stand behind a kicking horse, and let it dash its hoof at my chest—”

“Hush, Jane! you think too much of the love of human beings; you are
too impulsive, too vehement; the sovereign hand that created your
frame, and put life into it, has provided you with other resources than
your feeble self, or than creatures feeble as you. Besides this earth,
and besides the race of men, there is an invisible world and a kingdom
of spirits: that world is round us, for it is everywhere; and those
spirits watch us, for they are commissioned to guard us; and if we were
dying in pain and shame, if scorn smote us on all sides, and hatred
crushed us, angels see our tortures, recognise our innocence (if
innocent we be: as I know you are of this charge which Mr. Brocklehurst
has weakly and pompously repeated at second-hand from Mrs. Reed; for I
read a sincere nature in your ardent eyes and on your clear front), and
God waits only the separation of spirit from flesh to crown us with a
full reward. Why, then, should we ever sink overwhelmed with distress,
when life is so soon over, and death is so certain an entrance to
happiness—to glory?”

I was silent; Helen had calmed me; but in the tranquillity she imparted
there was an alloy of inexpressible sadness. I felt the impression of
woe as she spoke, but I could not tell whence it came; and when, having
done speaking, she breathed a little fast and coughed a short cough, I
momentarily forgot my own sorrows to yield to a vague concern for her.

Resting my head on Helen’s shoulder, I put my arms round her waist; she
drew me to her, and we reposed in silence. We had not sat long thus,
when another person came in. Some heavy clouds, swept from the sky by a
rising wind, had left the moon bare; and her light, streaming in
through a window near, shone full both on us and on the approaching
figure, which we at once recognised as Miss Temple.

“I came on purpose to find you, Jane Eyre,” said she; “I want you in my
room; and as Helen Burns is with you, she may come too.”

We went; following the superintendent’s guidance, we had to thread some
intricate passages, and mount a staircase before we reached her
apartment; it contained a good fire, and looked cheerful. Miss Temple
told Helen Burns to be seated in a low arm-chair on one side of the
hearth, and herself taking another, she called me to her side.

“Is it all over?” she asked, looking down at my face. “Have you cried
your grief away?”

“I am afraid I never shall do that.”

“Why?”

“Because I have been wrongly accused; and you, ma’am, and everybody
else, will now think me wicked.”

“We shall think you what you prove yourself to be, my child. Continue
to act as a good girl, and you will satisfy us.”

“Shall I, Miss Temple?”

“You will,” said she, passing her arm round me. “And now tell me who is
the lady whom Mr. Brocklehurst called your benefactress?”

“Mrs. Reed, my uncle’s wife. My uncle is dead, and he left me to her
care.”

“Did she not, then, adopt you of her own accord?”

“No, ma’am; she was sorry to have to do it: but my uncle, as I have
often heard the servants say, got her to promise before he died that
she would always keep me.”

“Well now, Jane, you know, or at least I will tell you, that when a
criminal is accused, he is always allowed to speak in his own defence.
You have been charged with falsehood; defend yourself to me as well as
you can. Say whatever your memory suggests is true; but add nothing and
exaggerate nothing.”

I resolved, in the depth of my heart, that I would be most
moderate—most correct; and, having reflected a few minutes in order to
arrange coherently what I had to say, I told her all the story of my
sad childhood. Exhausted by emotion, my language was more subdued than
it generally was when it developed that sad theme; and mindful of
Helen’s warnings against the indulgence of resentment, I infused into
the narrative far less of gall and wormwood than ordinary. Thus
restrained and simplified, it sounded more credible: I felt as I went
on that Miss Temple fully believed me.

In the course of the tale I had mentioned Mr. Lloyd as having come to
see me after the fit: for I never forgot the, to me, frightful episode
of the red-room: in detailing which, my excitement was sure, in some
degree, to break bounds; for nothing could soften in my recollection
the spasm of agony which clutched my heart when Mrs. Reed spurned my
wild supplication for pardon, and locked me a second time in the dark
and haunted chamber.

I had finished: Miss Temple regarded me a few minutes in silence; she
then said—

“I know something of Mr. Lloyd; I shall write to him; if his reply
agrees with your statement, you shall be publicly cleared from every
imputation; to me, Jane, you are clear now.”

She kissed me, and still keeping me at her side (where I was well
contented to stand, for I derived a child’s pleasure from the
contemplation of her face, her dress, her one or two ornaments, her
white forehead, her clustered and shining curls, and beaming dark
eyes), she proceeded to address Helen Burns.

“How are you to-night, Helen? Have you coughed much to-day?”

“Not quite so much, I think, ma’am.”

“And the pain in your chest?”

“It is a little better.”

Miss Temple got up, took her hand and examined her pulse; then she
returned to her own seat: as she resumed it, I heard her sigh low. She
was pensive a few minutes, then rousing herself, she said cheerfully—

“But you two are my visitors to-night; I must treat you as such.” She
rang her bell.

“Barbara,” she said to the servant who answered it, “I have not yet had
tea; bring the tray and place cups for these two young ladies.”

And a tray was soon brought. How pretty, to my eyes, did the china cups
and bright teapot look, placed on the little round table near the fire!
How fragrant was the steam of the beverage, and the scent of the toast!
of which, however, I, to my dismay (for I was beginning to be hungry)
discerned only a very small portion: Miss Temple discerned it too.

“Barbara,” said she, “can you not bring a little more bread and butter?
There is not enough for three.”

Barbara went out: she returned soon—

“Madam, Mrs. Harden says she has sent up the usual quantity.”

Mrs. Harden, be it observed, was the housekeeper: a woman after Mr.
Brocklehurst’s own heart, made up of equal parts of whalebone and iron.

“Oh, very well!” returned Miss Temple; “we must make it do, Barbara, I
suppose.” And as the girl withdrew she added, smiling, “Fortunately, I
have it in my power to supply deficiencies for this once.”

Having invited Helen and me to approach the table, and placed before
each of us a cup of tea with one delicious but thin morsel of toast,
she got up, unlocked a drawer, and taking from it a parcel wrapped in
paper, disclosed presently to our eyes a good-sized seed-cake.

“I meant to give each of you some of this to take with you,” said she,
“but as there is so little toast, you must have it now,” and she
proceeded to cut slices with a generous hand.

We feasted that evening as on nectar and ambrosia; and not the least
delight of the entertainment was the smile of gratification with which
our hostess regarded us, as we satisfied our famished appetites on the
delicate fare she liberally supplied.

Tea over and the tray removed, she again summoned us to the fire; we
sat one on each side of her, and now a conversation followed between
her and Helen, which it was indeed a privilege to be admitted to hear.

Miss Temple had always something of serenity in her air, of state in
her mien, of refined propriety in her language, which precluded
deviation into the ardent, the excited, the eager: something which
chastened the pleasure of those who looked on her and listened to her,
by a controlling sense of awe; and such was my feeling now: but as to
Helen Burns, I was struck with wonder.

The refreshing meal, the brilliant fire, the presence and kindness of
her beloved instructress, or, perhaps, more than all these, something
in her own unique mind, had roused her powers within her. They woke,
they kindled: first, they glowed in the bright tint of her cheek, which
till this hour I had never seen but pale and bloodless; then they shone
in the liquid lustre of her eyes, which had suddenly acquired a beauty
more singular than that of Miss Temple’s—a beauty neither of fine
colour nor long eyelash, nor pencilled brow, but of meaning, of
movement, of radiance. Then her soul sat on her lips, and language
flowed, from what source I cannot tell. Has a girl of fourteen a heart
large enough, vigorous enough, to hold the swelling spring of pure,
full, fervid eloquence? Such was the characteristic of Helen’s
discourse on that, to me, memorable evening; her spirit seemed
hastening to live within a very brief span as much as many live during
a protracted existence.

They conversed of things I had never heard of; of nations and times
past; of countries far away; of secrets of nature discovered or guessed
at: they spoke of books: how many they had read! What stores of
knowledge they possessed! Then they seemed so familiar with French
names and French authors: but my amazement reached its climax when Miss
Temple asked Helen if she sometimes snatched a moment to recall the
Latin her father had taught her, and taking a book from a shelf, bade
her read and construe a page of Virgil; and Helen obeyed, my organ of
veneration expanding at every sounding line. She had scarcely finished
ere the bell announced bedtime! no delay could be admitted; Miss Temple
embraced us both, saying, as she drew us to her heart—

“God bless you, my children!”

Helen she held a little longer than me: she let her go more
reluctantly; it was Helen her eye followed to the door; it was for her
she a second time breathed a sad sigh; for her she wiped a tear from
her cheek.

On reaching the bedroom, we heard the voice of Miss Scatcherd: she was
examining drawers; she had just pulled out Helen Burns’s, and when we
entered Helen was greeted with a sharp reprimand, and told that
to-morrow she should have half-a-dozen of untidily folded articles
pinned to her shoulder.

“My things were indeed in shameful disorder,” murmured Helen to me, in
a low voice: “I intended to have arranged them, but I forgot.”

Next morning, Miss Scatcherd wrote in conspicuous characters on a piece
of pasteboard the word “Slattern,” and bound it like a phylactery round
Helen’s large, mild, intelligent, and benign-looking forehead. She wore
it till evening, patient, unresentful, regarding it as a deserved
punishment. The moment Miss Scatcherd withdrew after afternoon school,
I ran to Helen, tore it off, and thrust it into the fire: the fury of
which she was incapable had been burning in my soul all day, and tears,
hot and large, had continually been scalding my cheek; for the
spectacle of her sad resignation gave me an intolerable pain at the
heart.

About a week subsequently to the incidents above narrated, Miss Temple,
who had written to Mr. Lloyd, received his answer: it appeared that
what he said went to corroborate my account. Miss Temple, having
assembled the whole school, announced that inquiry had been made into
the charges alleged against Jane Eyre, and that she was most happy to
be able to pronounce her completely cleared from every imputation. The
teachers then shook hands with me and kissed me, and a murmur of
pleasure ran through the ranks of my companions.

Thus relieved of a grievous load, I from that hour set to work afresh,
resolved to pioneer my way through every difficulty: I toiled hard, and
my success was proportionate to my efforts; my memory, not naturally
tenacious, improved with practice; exercise sharpened my wits; in a few
weeks I was promoted to a higher class; in less than two months I was
allowed to commence French and drawing. I learned the first two tenses
of the verb _Etre_, and sketched my first cottage (whose walls,
by-the-bye, outrivalled in slope those of the leaning tower of Pisa),
on the same day. That night, on going to bed, I forgot to prepare in
imagination the Barmecide supper of hot roast potatoes, or white bread
and new milk, with which I was wont to amuse my inward cravings: I
feasted instead on the spectacle of ideal drawings, which I saw in the
dark; all the work of my own hands: freely pencilled houses and trees,
picturesque rocks and ruins, Cuyp-like groups of cattle, sweet
paintings of butterflies hovering over unblown roses, of birds picking
at ripe cherries, of wren’s nests enclosing pearl-like eggs, wreathed
about with young ivy sprays. I examined, too, in thought, the
possibility of my ever being able to translate currently a certain
little French story which Madame Pierrot had that day shown me; nor was
that problem solved to my satisfaction ere I fell sweetly asleep.

Well has Solomon said—“Better is a dinner of herbs where love is, than
a stalled ox and hatred therewith.”

I would not now have exchanged Lowood with all its privations for
Gateshead and its daily luxuries.




CHAPTER IX


But the privations, or rather the hardships, of Lowood lessened. Spring
drew on: she was indeed already come; the frosts of winter had ceased;
its snows were melted, its cutting winds ameliorated. My wretched feet,
flayed and swollen to lameness by the sharp air of January, began to
heal and subside under the gentler breathings of April; the nights and
mornings no longer by their Canadian temperature froze the very blood
in our veins; we could now endure the play-hour passed in the garden:
sometimes on a sunny day it began even to be pleasant and genial, and a
greenness grew over those brown beds, which, freshening daily,
suggested the thought that Hope traversed them at night, and left each
morning brighter traces of her steps. Flowers peeped out amongst the
leaves; snow-drops, crocuses, purple auriculas, and golden-eyed
pansies. On Thursday afternoons (half-holidays) we now took walks, and
found still sweeter flowers opening by the wayside, under the hedges.

I discovered, too, that a great pleasure, an enjoyment which the
horizon only bounded, lay all outside the high and spike-guarded walls
of our garden: this pleasure consisted in prospect of noble summits
girdling a great hill-hollow, rich in verdure and shadow; in a bright
beck, full of dark stones and sparkling eddies. How different had this
scene looked when I viewed it laid out beneath the iron sky of winter,
stiffened in frost, shrouded with snow!—when mists as chill as death
wandered to the impulse of east winds along those purple peaks, and
rolled down “ing” and holm till they blended with the frozen fog of the
beck! That beck itself was then a torrent, turbid and curbless: it tore
asunder the wood, and sent a raving sound through the air, often
thickened with wild rain or whirling sleet; and for the forest on its
banks, _that_ showed only ranks of skeletons.

April advanced to May: a bright serene May it was; days of blue sky,
placid sunshine, and soft western or southern gales filled up its
duration. And now vegetation matured with vigour; Lowood shook loose
its tresses; it became all green, all flowery; its great elm, ash, and
oak skeletons were restored to majestic life; woodland plants sprang up
profusely in its recesses; unnumbered varieties of moss filled its
hollows, and it made a strange ground-sunshine out of the wealth of its
wild primrose plants: I have seen their pale gold gleam in overshadowed
spots like scatterings of the sweetest lustre. All this I enjoyed often
and fully, free, unwatched, and almost alone: for this unwonted liberty
and pleasure there was a cause, to which it now becomes my task to
advert.

Have I not described a pleasant site for a dwelling, when I speak of it
as bosomed in hill and wood, and rising from the verge of a stream?
Assuredly, pleasant enough: but whether healthy or not is another
question.

That forest-dell, where Lowood lay, was the cradle of fog and fog-bred
pestilence; which, quickening with the quickening spring, crept into
the Orphan Asylum, breathed typhus through its crowded schoolroom and
dormitory, and, ere May arrived, transformed the seminary into an
hospital.

Semi-starvation and neglected colds had predisposed most of the pupils
to receive infection: forty-five out of the eighty girls lay ill at one
time. Classes were broken up, rules relaxed. The few who continued well
were allowed almost unlimited license; because the medical attendant
insisted on the necessity of frequent exercise to keep them in health:
and had it been otherwise, no one had leisure to watch or restrain
them. Miss Temple’s whole attention was absorbed by the patients: she
lived in the sick-room, never quitting it except to snatch a few hours’
rest at night. The teachers were fully occupied with packing up and
making other necessary preparations for the departure of those girls
who were fortunate enough to have friends and relations able and
willing to remove them from the seat of contagion. Many, already
smitten, went home only to die: some died at the school, and were
buried quietly and quickly, the nature of the malady forbidding delay.

While disease had thus become an inhabitant of Lowood, and death its
frequent visitor; while there was gloom and fear within its walls;
while its rooms and passages steamed with hospital smells, the drug and
the pastille striving vainly to overcome the effluvia of mortality,
that bright May shone unclouded over the bold hills and beautiful
woodland out of doors. Its garden, too, glowed with flowers: hollyhocks
had sprung up tall as trees, lilies had opened, tulips and roses were
in bloom; the borders of the little beds were gay with pink thrift and
crimson double daisies; the sweetbriars gave out, morning and evening,
their scent of spice and apples; and these fragrant treasures were all
useless for most of the inmates of Lowood, except to furnish now and
then a handful of herbs and blossoms to put in a coffin.

But I, and the rest who continued well, enjoyed fully the beauties of
the scene and season; they let us ramble in the wood, like gipsies,
from morning till night; we did what we liked, went where we liked: we
lived better too. Mr. Brocklehurst and his family never came near
Lowood now: household matters were not scrutinised into; the cross
housekeeper was gone, driven away by the fear of infection; her
successor, who had been matron at the Lowton Dispensary, unused to the
ways of her new abode, provided with comparative liberality. Besides,
there were fewer to feed; the sick could eat little; our
breakfast-basins were better filled; when there was no time to prepare
a regular dinner, which often happened, she would give us a large piece
of cold pie, or a thick slice of bread and cheese, and this we carried
away with us to the wood, where we each chose the spot we liked best,
and dined sumptuously.

My favourite seat was a smooth and broad stone, rising white and dry
from the very middle of the beck, and only to be got at by wading
through the water; a feat I accomplished barefoot. The stone was just
broad enough to accommodate, comfortably, another girl and me, at that
time my chosen comrade—one Mary Ann Wilson; a shrewd, observant
personage, whose society I took pleasure in, partly because she was
witty and original, and partly because she had a manner which set me at
my ease. Some years older than I, she knew more of the world, and could
tell me many things I liked to hear: with her my curiosity found
gratification: to my faults also she gave ample indulgence, never
imposing curb or rein on anything I said. She had a turn for narrative,
I for analysis; she liked to inform, I to question; so we got on
swimmingly together, deriving much entertainment, if not much
improvement, from our mutual intercourse.

And where, meantime, was Helen Burns? Why did I not spend these sweet
days of liberty with her? Had I forgotten her? or was I so worthless as
to have grown tired of her pure society? Surely the Mary Ann Wilson I
have mentioned was inferior to my first acquaintance: she could only
tell me amusing stories, and reciprocate any racy and pungent gossip I
chose to indulge in; while, if I have spoken truth of Helen, she was
qualified to give those who enjoyed the privilege of her converse a
taste of far higher things.

True, reader; and I knew and felt this: and though I am a defective
being, with many faults and few redeeming points, yet I never tired of
Helen Burns; nor ever ceased to cherish for her a sentiment of
attachment, as strong, tender, and respectful as any that ever animated
my heart. How could it be otherwise, when Helen, at all times and under
all circumstances, evinced for me a quiet and faithful friendship,
which ill-humour never soured, nor irritation never troubled? But Helen
was ill at present: for some weeks she had been removed from my sight
to I knew not what room upstairs. She was not, I was told, in the
hospital portion of the house with the fever patients; for her
complaint was consumption, not typhus: and by consumption I, in my
ignorance, understood something mild, which time and care would be sure
to alleviate.

I was confirmed in this idea by the fact of her once or twice coming
downstairs on very warm sunny afternoons, and being taken by Miss
Temple into the garden; but, on these occasions, I was not allowed to
go and speak to her; I only saw her from the schoolroom window, and
then not distinctly; for she was much wrapped up, and sat at a distance
under the verandah.

One evening, in the beginning of June, I had stayed out very late with
Mary Ann in the wood; we had, as usual, separated ourselves from the
others, and had wandered far; so far that we lost our way, and had to
ask it at a lonely cottage, where a man and woman lived, who looked
after a herd of half-wild swine that fed on the mast in the wood. When
we got back, it was after moonrise: a pony, which we knew to be the
surgeon’s, was standing at the garden door. Mary Ann remarked that she
supposed some one must be very ill, as Mr. Bates had been sent for at
that time of the evening. She went into the house; I stayed behind a
few minutes to plant in my garden a handful of roots I had dug up in
the forest, and which I feared would wither if I left them till the
morning. This done, I lingered yet a little longer: the flowers smelt
so sweet as the dew fell; it was such a pleasant evening, so serene, so
warm; the still glowing west promised so fairly another fine day on the
morrow; the moon rose with such majesty in the grave east. I was noting
these things and enjoying them as a child might, when it entered my
mind as it had never done before:—

“How sad to be lying now on a sick bed, and to be in danger of dying!
This world is pleasant—it would be dreary to be called from it, and to
have to go who knows where?”

And then my mind made its first earnest effort to comprehend what had
been infused into it concerning heaven and hell; and for the first time
it recoiled, baffled; and for the first time glancing behind, on each
side, and before it, it saw all round an unfathomed gulf: it felt the
one point where it stood—the present; all the rest was formless cloud
and vacant depth; and it shuddered at the thought of tottering, and
plunging amid that chaos. While pondering this new idea, I heard the
front door open; Mr. Bates came out, and with him was a nurse. After
she had seen him mount his horse and depart, she was about to close the
door, but I ran up to her.

“How is Helen Burns?”

“Very poorly,” was the answer.

“Is it her Mr. Bates has been to see?”

“Yes.”

“And what does he say about her?”

“He says she’ll not be here long.”

This phrase, uttered in my hearing yesterday, would have only conveyed
the notion that she was about to be removed to Northumberland, to her
own home. I should not have suspected that it meant she was dying; but
I knew instantly now! It opened clear on my comprehension that Helen
Burns was numbering her last days in this world, and that she was going
to be taken to the region of spirits, if such region there were. I
experienced a shock of horror, then a strong thrill of grief, then a
desire—a necessity to see her; and I asked in what room she lay.

“She is in Miss Temple’s room,” said the nurse.

“May I go up and speak to her?”

“Oh no, child! It is not likely; and now it is time for you to come in;
you’ll catch the fever if you stop out when the dew is falling.”

The nurse closed the front door; I went in by the side entrance which
led to the schoolroom: I was just in time; it was nine o’clock, and
Miss Miller was calling the pupils to go to bed.

It might be two hours later, probably near eleven, when I—not having
been able to fall asleep, and deeming, from the perfect silence of the
dormitory, that my companions were all wrapt in profound repose—rose
softly, put on my frock over my night-dress, and, without shoes, crept
from the apartment, and set off in quest of Miss Temple’s room. It was
quite at the other end of the house; but I knew my way; and the light
of the unclouded summer moon, entering here and there at passage
windows, enabled me to find it without difficulty. An odour of camphor
and burnt vinegar warned me when I came near the fever room: and I
passed its door quickly, fearful lest the nurse who sat up all night
should hear me. I dreaded being discovered and sent back; for I _must_
see Helen,—I must embrace her before she died,—I must give her one last
kiss, exchange with her one last word.

Having descended a staircase, traversed a portion of the house below,
and succeeded in opening and shutting, without noise, two doors, I
reached another flight of steps; these I mounted, and then just
opposite to me was Miss Temple’s room. A light shone through the
keyhole and from under the door; a profound stillness pervaded the
vicinity. Coming near, I found the door slightly ajar; probably to
admit some fresh air into the close abode of sickness. Indisposed to
hesitate, and full of impatient impulses—soul and senses quivering with
keen throes—I put it back and looked in. My eye sought Helen, and
feared to find death.

Close by Miss Temple’s bed, and half covered with its white curtains,
there stood a little crib. I saw the outline of a form under the
clothes, but the face was hid by the hangings: the nurse I had spoken
to in the garden sat in an easy-chair asleep; an unsnuffed candle burnt
dimly on the table. Miss Temple was not to be seen: I knew afterwards
that she had been called to a delirious patient in the fever-room. I
advanced; then paused by the crib side: my hand was on the curtain, but
I preferred speaking before I withdrew it. I still recoiled at the
dread of seeing a corpse.

“Helen!” I whispered softly, “are you awake?”

She stirred herself, put back the curtain, and I saw her face, pale,
wasted, but quite composed: she looked so little changed that my fear
was instantly dissipated.

“Can it be you, Jane?” she asked, in her own gentle voice.

“Oh!” I thought, “she is not going to die; they are mistaken: she could
not speak and look so calmly if she were.”

I got on to her crib and kissed her: her forehead was cold, and her
cheek both cold and thin, and so were her hand and wrist; but she
smiled as of old.

“Why are you come here, Jane? It is past eleven o’clock: I heard it
strike some minutes since.”

“I came to see you, Helen: I heard you were very ill, and I could not
sleep till I had spoken to you.”

“You came to bid me good-bye, then: you are just in time probably.”

“Are you going somewhere, Helen? Are you going home?”

“Yes; to my long home—my last home.”

“No, no, Helen!” I stopped, distressed. While I tried to devour my
tears, a fit of coughing seized Helen; it did not, however, wake the
nurse; when it was over, she lay some minutes exhausted; then she
whispered—

“Jane, your little feet are bare; lie down and cover yourself with my
quilt.”

I did so: she put her arm over me, and I nestled close to her. After a
long silence, she resumed, still whispering—

“I am very happy, Jane; and when you hear that I am dead, you must be
sure and not grieve: there is nothing to grieve about. We all must die
one day, and the illness which is removing me is not painful; it is
gentle and gradual: my mind is at rest. I leave no one to regret me
much: I have only a father; and he is lately married, and will not miss
me. By dying young, I shall escape great sufferings. I had not
qualities or talents to make my way very well in the world: I should
have been continually at fault.”

“But where are you going to, Helen? Can you see? Do you know?”

“I believe; I have faith: I am going to God.”

“Where is God? What is God?”

“My Maker and yours, who will never destroy what He created. I rely
implicitly on His power, and confide wholly in His goodness: I count
the hours till that eventful one arrives which shall restore me to Him,
reveal Him to me.”

“You are sure, then, Helen, that there is such a place as heaven, and
that our souls can get to it when we die?”

“I am sure there is a future state; I believe God is good; I can resign
my immortal part to Him without any misgiving. God is my father; God is
my friend: I love Him; I believe He loves me.”

“And shall I see you again, Helen, when I die?”

“You will come to the same region of happiness: be received by the same
mighty, universal Parent, no doubt, dear Jane.”

Again I questioned, but this time only in thought. “Where is that
region? Does it exist?” And I clasped my arms closer round Helen; she
seemed dearer to me than ever; I felt as if I could not let her go; I
lay with my face hidden on her neck. Presently she said, in the
sweetest tone—

“How comfortable I am! That last fit of coughing has tired me a little;
I feel as if I could sleep: but don’t leave me, Jane; I like to have
you near me.”

“I’ll stay with you, _dear_ Helen: no one shall take me away.”

“Are you warm, darling?”

“Yes.”

“Good-night, Jane.”

“Good-night, Helen.”

She kissed me, and I her, and we both soon slumbered.

When I awoke it was day: an unusual movement roused me; I looked up; I
was in somebody’s arms; the nurse held me; she was carrying me through
the passage back to the dormitory. I was not reprimanded for leaving my
bed; people had something else to think about; no explanation was
afforded then to my many questions; but a day or two afterwards I
learned that Miss Temple, on returning to her own room at dawn, had
found me laid in the little crib; my face against Helen Burns’s
shoulder, my arms round her neck. I was asleep, and Helen was—dead.

Her grave is in Brocklebridge churchyard: for fifteen years after her
death it was only covered by a grassy mound; but now a grey marble
tablet marks the spot, inscribed with her name, and the word
“Resurgam.”




CHAPTER X


Hitherto I have recorded in detail the events of my insignificant
existence: to the first ten years of my life I have given almost as
many chapters. But this is not to be a regular autobiography: I am only
bound to invoke Memory where I know her responses will possess some
degree of interest; therefore I now pass a space of eight years almost
in silence: a few lines only are necessary to keep up the links of
connection.

When the typhus fever had fulfilled its mission of devastation at
Lowood, it gradually disappeared from thence; but not till its
virulence and the number of its victims had drawn public attention on
the school. Inquiry was made into the origin of the scourge, and by
degrees various facts came out which excited public indignation in a
high degree. The unhealthy nature of the site; the quantity and quality
of the children’s food; the brackish, fetid water used in its
preparation; the pupils’ wretched clothing and accommodations—all these
things were discovered, and the discovery produced a result mortifying
to Mr. Brocklehurst, but beneficial to the institution.

Several wealthy and benevolent individuals in the county subscribed
largely for the erection of a more convenient building in a better
situation; new regulations were made; improvements in diet and clothing
introduced; the funds of the school were intrusted to the management of
a committee. Mr. Brocklehurst, who, from his wealth and family
connections, could not be overlooked, still retained the post of
treasurer; but he was aided in the discharge of his duties by gentlemen
of rather more enlarged and sympathising minds: his office of
inspector, too, was shared by those who knew how to combine reason with
strictness, comfort with economy, compassion with uprightness. The
school, thus improved, became in time a truly useful and noble
institution. I remained an inmate of its walls, after its regeneration,
for eight years: six as pupil, and two as teacher; and in both
capacities I bear my testimony to its value and importance.

During these eight years my life was uniform: but not unhappy, because
it was not inactive. I had the means of an excellent education placed
within my reach; a fondness for some of my studies, and a desire to
excel in all, together with a great delight in pleasing my teachers,
especially such as I loved, urged me on: I availed myself fully of the
advantages offered me. In time I rose to be the first girl of the first
class; then I was invested with the office of teacher; which I
discharged with zeal for two years: but at the end of that time I
altered.

Miss Temple, through all changes, had thus far continued superintendent
of the seminary: to her instruction I owed the best part of my
acquirements; her friendship and society had been my continual solace;
she had stood me in the stead of mother, governess, and, latterly,
companion. At this period she married, removed with her husband (a
clergyman, an excellent man, almost worthy of such a wife) to a distant
county, and consequently was lost to me.

From the day she left I was no longer the same: with her was gone every
settled feeling, every association that had made Lowood in some degree
a home to me. I had imbibed from her something of her nature and much
of her habits: more harmonious thoughts: what seemed better regulated
feelings had become the inmates of my mind. I had given in allegiance
to duty and order; I was quiet; I believed I was content: to the eyes
of others, usually even to my own, I appeared a disciplined and subdued
character.

But destiny, in the shape of the Rev. Mr. Nasmyth, came between me and
Miss Temple: I saw her in her travelling dress step into a post-chaise,
shortly after the marriage ceremony; I watched the chaise mount the
hill and disappear beyond its brow; and then retired to my own room,
and there spent in solitude the greatest part of the half-holiday
granted in honour of the occasion.

I walked about the chamber most of the time. I imagined myself only to
be regretting my loss, and thinking how to repair it; but when my
reflections were concluded, and I looked up and found that the
afternoon was gone, and evening far advanced, another discovery dawned
on me, namely, that in the interval I had undergone a transforming
process; that my mind had put off all it had borrowed of Miss Temple—or
rather that she had taken with her the serene atmosphere I had been
breathing in her vicinity—and that now I was left in my natural
element, and beginning to feel the stirring of old emotions. It did not
seem as if a prop were withdrawn, but rather as if a motive were gone:
it was not the power to be tranquil which had failed me, but the reason
for tranquillity was no more. My world had for some years been in
Lowood: my experience had been of its rules and systems; now I
remembered that the real world was wide, and that a varied field of
hopes and fears, of sensations and excitements, awaited those who had
courage to go forth into its expanse, to seek real knowledge of life
amidst its perils.

I went to my window, opened it, and looked out. There were the two
wings of the building; there was the garden; there were the skirts of
Lowood; there was the hilly horizon. My eye passed all other objects to
rest on those most remote, the blue peaks; it was those I longed to
surmount; all within their boundary of rock and heath seemed
prison-ground, exile limits. I traced the white road winding round the
base of one mountain, and vanishing in a gorge between two; how I
longed to follow it farther! I recalled the time when I had travelled
that very road in a coach; I remembered descending that hill at
twilight; an age seemed to have elapsed since the day which brought me
first to Lowood, and I had never quitted it since. My vacations had all
been spent at school: Mrs. Reed had never sent for me to Gateshead;
neither she nor any of her family had ever been to visit me. I had had
no communication by letter or message with the outer world:
school-rules, school-duties, school-habits and notions, and voices, and
faces, and phrases, and costumes, and preferences, and antipathies—such
was what I knew of existence. And now I felt that it was not enough; I
tired of the routine of eight years in one afternoon. I desired
liberty; for liberty I gasped; for liberty I uttered a prayer; it
seemed scattered on the wind then faintly blowing. I abandoned it and
framed a humbler supplication; for change, stimulus: that petition,
too, seemed swept off into vague space: “Then,” I cried, half
desperate, “grant me at least a new servitude!”

Here a bell, ringing the hour of supper, called me downstairs.

I was not free to resume the interrupted chain of my reflections till
bedtime: even then a teacher who occupied the same room with me kept me
from the subject to which I longed to recur, by a prolonged effusion of
small talk. How I wished sleep would silence her. It seemed as if,
could I but go back to the idea which had last entered my mind as I
stood at the window, some inventive suggestion would rise for my
relief.

Miss Gryce snored at last; she was a heavy Welshwoman, and till now her
habitual nasal strains had never been regarded by me in any other light
than as a nuisance; to-night I hailed the first deep notes with
satisfaction; I was debarrassed of interruption; my half-effaced
thought instantly revived.

“A new servitude! There is something in that,” I soliloquised
(mentally, be it understood; I did not talk aloud), “I know there is,
because it does not sound too sweet; it is not like such words as
Liberty, Excitement, Enjoyment: delightful sounds truly; but no more
than sounds for me; and so hollow and fleeting that it is mere waste of
time to listen to them. But Servitude! That must be matter of fact. Any
one may serve: I have served here eight years; now all I want is to
serve elsewhere. Can I not get so much of my own will? Is not the thing
feasible? Yes—yes—the end is not so difficult; if I had only a brain
active enough to ferret out the means of attaining it.”

I sat up in bed by way of arousing this said brain: it was a chilly
night; I covered my shoulders with a shawl, and then I proceeded _to
think_ again with all my might.

“What do I want? A new place, in a new house, amongst new faces, under
new circumstances: I want this because it is of no use wanting anything
better. How do people do to get a new place? They apply to friends, I
suppose: I have no friends. There are many others who have no friends,
who must look about for themselves and be their own helpers; and what
is their resource?”

I could not tell: nothing answered me; I then ordered my brain to find
a response, and quickly. It worked and worked faster: I felt the pulses
throb in my head and temples; but for nearly an hour it worked in
chaos; and no result came of its efforts. Feverish with vain labour, I
got up and took a turn in the room; undrew the curtain, noted a star or
two, shivered with cold, and again crept to bed.

A kind fairy, in my absence, had surely dropped the required suggestion
on my pillow; for as I lay down, it came quietly and naturally to my
mind:—“Those who want situations advertise; you must advertise in the
_——shire Herald_.”

“How? I know nothing about advertising.”

Replies rose smooth and prompt now:—

“You must enclose the advertisement and the money to pay for it under a
cover directed to the editor of the _Herald_; you must put it, the
first opportunity you have, into the post at Lowton; answers must be
addressed to J.E., at the post-office there; you can go and inquire in
about a week after you send your letter, if any are come, and act
accordingly.”

This scheme I went over twice, thrice; it was then digested in my mind;
I had it in a clear practical form: I felt satisfied, and fell asleep.

With earliest day, I was up: I had my advertisement written, enclosed,
and directed before the bell rang to rouse the school; it ran thus:—

“A young lady accustomed to tuition” (had I not been a teacher two
years?) “is desirous of meeting with a situation in a private family
where the children are under fourteen” (I thought that as I was barely
eighteen, it would not do to undertake the guidance of pupils nearer my
own age). “She is qualified to teach the usual branches of a good
English education, together with French, Drawing, and Music” (in those
days, reader, this now narrow catalogue of accomplishments, would have
been held tolerably comprehensive). “Address, J.E., Post-office,
Lowton, ——shire.”

This document remained locked in my drawer all day: after tea, I asked
leave of the new superintendent to go to Lowton, in order to perform
some small commissions for myself and one or two of my fellow-teachers;
permission was readily granted; I went. It was a walk of two miles, and
the evening was wet, but the days were still long; I visited a shop or
two, slipped the letter into the post-office, and came back through
heavy rain, with streaming garments, but with a relieved heart.

The succeeding week seemed long: it came to an end at last, however,
like all sublunary things, and once more, towards the close of a
pleasant autumn day, I found myself afoot on the road to Lowton. A
picturesque track it was, by the way; lying along the side of the beck
and through the sweetest curves of the dale: but that day I thought
more of the letters, that might or might not be awaiting me at the
little burgh whither I was bound, than of the charms of lea and water.

My ostensible errand on this occasion was to get measured for a pair of
shoes; so I discharged that business first, and when it was done, I
stepped across the clean and quiet little street from the shoemaker’s
to the post-office: it was kept by an old dame, who wore horn
spectacles on her nose, and black mittens on her hands.

“Are there any letters for J.E.?” I asked.

She peered at me over her spectacles, and then she opened a drawer and
fumbled among its contents for a long time, so long that my hopes began
to falter. At last, having held a document before her glasses for
nearly five minutes, she presented it across the counter, accompanying
the act by another inquisitive and mistrustful glance—it was for J.E.

“Is there only one?” I demanded.

“There are no more,” said she; and I put it in my pocket and turned my
face homeward: I could not open it then; rules obliged me to be back by
eight, and it was already half-past seven.

Various duties awaited me on my arrival: I had to sit with the girls
during their hour of study; then it was my turn to read prayers; to see
them to bed: afterwards I supped with the other teachers. Even when we
finally retired for the night, the inevitable Miss Gryce was still my
companion: we had only a short end of candle in our candlestick, and I
dreaded lest she should talk till it was all burnt out; fortunately,
however, the heavy supper she had eaten produced a soporific effect:
she was already snoring before I had finished undressing. There still
remained an inch of candle: I now took out my letter; the seal was an
initial F.; I broke it; the contents were brief.

“If J.E., who advertised in the _——shire Herald_ of last Thursday,
possesses the acquirements mentioned, and if she is in a position to
give satisfactory references as to character and competency, a
situation can be offered her where there is but one pupil, a little
girl, under ten years of age; and where the salary is thirty pounds per
annum. J.E. is requested to send references, name, address, and all
particulars to the direction:—

“Mrs. Fairfax, Thornfield, near Millcote, ——shire.”

I examined the document long: the writing was old-fashioned and rather
uncertain, like that of an elderly lady. This circumstance was
satisfactory: a private fear had haunted me, that in thus acting for
myself, and by my own guidance, I ran the risk of getting into some
scrape; and, above all things, I wished the result of my endeavours to
be respectable, proper, _en règle_. I now felt that an elderly lady was
no bad ingredient in the business I had on hand. Mrs. Fairfax! I saw
her in a black gown and widow’s cap; frigid, perhaps, but not uncivil:
a model of elderly English respectability. Thornfield! that, doubtless,
was the name of her house: a neat orderly spot, I was sure; though I
failed in my efforts to conceive a correct plan of the premises.
Millcote, ——shire; I brushed up my recollections of the map of England;
yes, I saw it; both the shire and the town. ——shire was seventy miles
nearer London than the remote county where I now resided: that was a
recommendation to me. I longed to go where there was life and movement:
Millcote was a large manufacturing town on the banks of the A——: a busy
place enough, doubtless: so much the better; it would be a complete
change at least. Not that my fancy was much captivated by the idea of
long chimneys and clouds of smoke—“but,” I argued, “Thornfield will,
probably, be a good way from the town.”

Here the socket of the candle dropped, and the wick went out.

Next day new steps were to be taken; my plans could no longer be
confined to my own breast; I must impart them in order to achieve their
success. Having sought and obtained an audience of the superintendent
during the noontide recreation, I told her I had a prospect of getting
a new situation where the salary would be double what I now received
(for at Lowood I only got £15 per annum); and requested she would break
the matter for me to Mr. Brocklehurst, or some of the committee, and
ascertain whether they would permit me to mention them as references.
She obligingly consented to act as mediatrix in the matter. The next
day she laid the affair before Mr. Brocklehurst, who said that Mrs.
Reed must be written to, as she was my natural guardian. A note was
accordingly addressed to that lady, who returned for answer, that “I
might do as I pleased: she had long relinquished all interference in my
affairs.” This note went the round of the committee, and at last, after
what appeared to me most tedious delay, formal leave was given me to
better my condition if I could; and an assurance added, that as I had
always conducted myself well, both as teacher and pupil, at Lowood, a
testimonial of character and capacity, signed by the inspectors of that
institution, should forthwith be furnished me.

This testimonial I accordingly received in about a month, forwarded a
copy of it to Mrs. Fairfax, and got that lady’s reply, stating that she
was satisfied, and fixing that day fortnight as the period for my
assuming the post of governess in her house.

I now busied myself in preparations: the fortnight passed rapidly. I
had not a very large wardrobe, though it was adequate to my wants; and
the last day sufficed to pack my trunk,—the same I had brought with me
eight years ago from Gateshead.

The box was corded, the card nailed on. In half-an-hour the carrier was
to call for it to take it to Lowton, whither I myself was to repair at
an early hour the next morning to meet the coach. I had brushed my
black stuff travelling-dress, prepared my bonnet, gloves, and muff;
sought in all my drawers to see that no article was left behind; and
now having nothing more to do, I sat down and tried to rest. I could
not; though I had been on foot all day, I could not now repose an
instant; I was too much excited. A phase of my life was closing
to-night, a new one opening to-morrow: impossible to slumber in the
interval; I must watch feverishly while the change was being
accomplished.

“Miss,” said a servant who met me in the lobby, where I was wandering
like a troubled spirit, “a person below wishes to see you.”

“The carrier, no doubt,” I thought, and ran downstairs without inquiry.
I was passing the back-parlour or teachers’ sitting-room, the door of
which was half open, to go to the kitchen, when some one ran out—

“It’s her, I am sure!—I could have told her anywhere!” cried the
individual who stopped my progress and took my hand.

I looked: I saw a woman attired like a well-dressed servant, matronly,
yet still young; very good-looking, with black hair and eyes, and
lively complexion.

“Well, who is it?” she asked, in a voice and with a smile I half
recognised; “you’ve not quite forgotten me, I think, Miss Jane?”

In another second I was embracing and kissing her rapturously: “Bessie!
Bessie! Bessie!” that was all I said; whereat she half laughed, half
cried, and we both went into the parlour. By the fire stood a little
fellow of three years old, in plaid frock and trousers.

“That is my little boy,” said Bessie directly.

“Then you are married, Bessie?”

“Yes; nearly five years since to Robert Leaven, the coachman; and I’ve
a little girl besides Bobby there, that I’ve christened Jane.”

“And you don’t live at Gateshead?”

“I live at the lodge: the old porter has left.”

“Well, and how do they all get on? Tell me everything about them,
Bessie: but sit down first; and, Bobby, come and sit on my knee, will
you?” but Bobby preferred sidling over to his mother.

“You’re not grown so very tall, Miss Jane, nor so very stout,”
continued Mrs. Leaven. “I dare say they’ve not kept you too well at
school: Miss Reed is the head and shoulders taller than you are; and
Miss Georgiana would make two of you in breadth.”

“Georgiana is handsome, I suppose, Bessie?”

“Very. She went up to London last winter with her mama, and there
everybody admired her, and a young lord fell in love with her: but his
relations were against the match; and—what do you think?—he and Miss
Georgiana made it up to run away; but they were found out and stopped.
It was Miss Reed that found them out: I believe she was envious; and
now she and her sister lead a cat and dog life together; they are
always quarrelling—”

“Well, and what of John Reed?”

“Oh, he is not doing so well as his mama could wish. He went to
college, and he got—plucked, I think they call it: and then his uncles
wanted him to be a barrister, and study the law: but he is such a
dissipated young man, they will never make much of him, I think.”

“What does he look like?”

“He is very tall: some people call him a fine-looking young man; but he
has such thick lips.”

“And Mrs. Reed?”

“Missis looks stout and well enough in the face, but I think she’s not
quite easy in her mind: Mr. John’s conduct does not please her—he
spends a deal of money.”

“Did she send you here, Bessie?”

“No, indeed: but I have long wanted to see you, and when I heard that
there had been a letter from you, and that you were going to another
part of the country, I thought I’d just set off, and get a look at you
before you were quite out of my reach.”

“I am afraid you are disappointed in me, Bessie.” I said this laughing:
I perceived that Bessie’s glance, though it expressed regard, did in no
shape denote admiration.

“No, Miss Jane, not exactly: you are genteel enough; you look like a
lady, and it is as much as ever I expected of you: you were no beauty
as a child.”

I smiled at Bessie’s frank answer: I felt that it was correct, but I
confess I was not quite indifferent to its import: at eighteen most
people wish to please, and the conviction that they have not an
exterior likely to second that desire brings anything but
gratification.

“I dare say you are clever, though,” continued Bessie, by way of
solace. “What can you do? Can you play on the piano?”

“A little.”

There was one in the room; Bessie went and opened it, and then asked me
to sit down and give her a tune: I played a waltz or two, and she was
charmed.

“The Miss Reeds could not play as well!” said she exultingly. “I always
said you would surpass them in learning: and can you draw?”

“That is one of my paintings over the chimney-piece.” It was a
landscape in water colours, of which I had made a present to the
superintendent, in acknowledgment of her obliging mediation with the
committee on my behalf, and which she had framed and glazed.

“Well, that is beautiful, Miss Jane! It is as fine a picture as any
Miss Reed’s drawing-master could paint, let alone the young ladies
themselves, who could not come near it: and have you learnt French?”

“Yes, Bessie, I can both read it and speak it.”

“And you can work on muslin and canvas?”

“I can.”

“Oh, you are quite a lady, Miss Jane! I knew you would be: you will get
on whether your relations notice you or not. There was something I
wanted to ask you. Have you ever heard anything from your father’s
kinsfolk, the Eyres?”

“Never in my life.”

“Well, you know Missis always said they were poor and quite despicable:
and they may be poor; but I believe they are as much gentry as the
Reeds are; for one day, nearly seven years ago, a Mr. Eyre came to
Gateshead and wanted to see you; Missis said you were at school fifty
miles off; he seemed so much disappointed, for he could not stay: he
was going on a voyage to a foreign country, and the ship was to sail
from London in a day or two. He looked quite a gentleman, and I believe
he was your father’s brother.”

“What foreign country was he going to, Bessie?”

“An island thousands of miles off, where they make wine—the butler did
tell me—”

“Madeira?” I suggested.

“Yes, that is it—that is the very word.”

“So he went?”

“Yes; he did not stay many minutes in the house: Missis was very high
with him; she called him afterwards a ‘sneaking tradesman.’ My Robert
believes he was a wine-merchant.”

“Very likely,” I returned; “or perhaps clerk or agent to a
wine-merchant.”

Bessie and I conversed about old times an hour longer, and then she was
obliged to leave me: I saw her again for a few minutes the next morning
at Lowton, while I was waiting for the coach. We parted finally at the
door of the Brocklehurst Arms there: each went her separate way; she
set off for the brow of Lowood Fell to meet the conveyance which was to
take her back to Gateshead, I mounted the vehicle which was to bear me
to new duties and a new life in the unknown environs of Millcote.




CHAPTER XI


A new chapter in a novel is something like a new scene in a play; and
when I draw up the curtain this time, reader, you must fancy you see a
room in the George Inn at Millcote, with such large figured papering on
the walls as inn rooms have; such a carpet, such furniture, such
ornaments on the mantelpiece, such prints, including a portrait of
George the Third, and another of the Prince of Wales, and a
representation of the death of Wolfe. All this is visible to you by the
light of an oil lamp hanging from the ceiling, and by that of an
excellent fire, near which I sit in my cloak and bonnet; my muff and
umbrella lie on the table, and I am warming away the numbness and chill
contracted by sixteen hours’ exposure to the rawness of an October day:
I left Lowton at four o’clock A.M., and the Millcote town clock is now
just striking eight.

Reader, though I look comfortably accommodated, I am not very tranquil
in my mind. I thought when the coach stopped here there would be some
one to meet me; I looked anxiously round as I descended the wooden
steps the “boots” placed for my convenience, expecting to hear my name
pronounced, and to see some description of carriage waiting to convey
me to Thornfield. Nothing of the sort was visible; and when I asked a
waiter if any one had been to inquire after a Miss Eyre, I was answered
in the negative: so I had no resource but to request to be shown into a
private room: and here I am waiting, while all sorts of doubts and
fears are troubling my thoughts.

It is a very strange sensation to inexperienced youth to feel itself
quite alone in the world, cut adrift from every connection, uncertain
whether the port to which it is bound can be reached, and prevented by
many impediments from returning to that it has quitted. The charm of
adventure sweetens that sensation, the glow of pride warms it; but then
the throb of fear disturbs it; and fear with me became predominant when
half-an-hour elapsed and still I was alone. I bethought myself to ring
the bell.

“Is there a place in this neighbourhood called Thornfield?” I asked of
the waiter who answered the summons.

“Thornfield? I don’t know, ma’am; I’ll inquire at the bar.” He
vanished, but reappeared instantly—

“Is your name Eyre, Miss?”

“Yes.”

“Person here waiting for you.”

I jumped up, took my muff and umbrella, and hastened into the
inn-passage: a man was standing by the open door, and in the lamp-lit
street I dimly saw a one-horse conveyance.

“This will be your luggage, I suppose?” said the man rather abruptly
when he saw me, pointing to my trunk in the passage.

“Yes.” He hoisted it on to the vehicle, which was a sort of car, and
then I got in; before he shut me up, I asked him how far it was to
Thornfield.

“A matter of six miles.”

“How long shall we be before we get there?”

“Happen an hour and a half.”

He fastened the car door, climbed to his own seat outside, and we set
off. Our progress was leisurely, and gave me ample time to reflect; I
was content to be at length so near the end of my journey; and as I
leaned back in the comfortable though not elegant conveyance, I
meditated much at my ease.

“I suppose,” thought I, “judging from the plainness of the servant and
carriage, Mrs. Fairfax is not a very dashing person: so much the
better; I never lived amongst fine people but once, and I was very
miserable with them. I wonder if she lives alone except this little
girl; if so, and if she is in any degree amiable, I shall surely be
able to get on with her; I will do my best; it is a pity that doing
one’s best does not always answer. At Lowood, indeed, I took that
resolution, kept it, and succeeded in pleasing; but with Mrs. Reed, I
remember my best was always spurned with scorn. I pray God Mrs. Fairfax
may not turn out a second Mrs. Reed; but if she does, I am not bound to
stay with her! let the worst come to the worst, I can advertise again.
How far are we on our road now, I wonder?”

I let down the window and looked out; Millcote was behind us; judging
by the number of its lights, it seemed a place of considerable
magnitude, much larger than Lowton. We were now, as far as I could see,
on a sort of common; but there were houses scattered all over the
district; I felt we were in a different region to Lowood, more
populous, less picturesque; more stirring, less romantic.

The roads were heavy, the night misty; my conductor let his horse walk
all the way, and the hour and a half extended, I verily believe, to two
hours; at last he turned in his seat and said—

“You’re noan so far fro’ Thornfield now.”

Again I looked out: we were passing a church; I saw its low broad tower
against the sky, and its bell was tolling a quarter; I saw a narrow
galaxy of lights too, on a hillside, marking a village or hamlet. About
ten minutes after, the driver got down and opened a pair of gates: we
passed through, and they clashed to behind us. We now slowly ascended a
drive, and came upon the long front of a house: candlelight gleamed
from one curtained bow-window; all the rest were dark. The car stopped
at the front door; it was opened by a maid-servant; I alighted and went
in.

“Will you walk this way, ma’am?” said the girl; and I followed her
across a square hall with high doors all round: she ushered me into a
room whose double illumination of fire and candle at first dazzled me,
contrasting as it did with the darkness to which my eyes had been for
two hours inured; when I could see, however, a cosy and agreeable
picture presented itself to my view.

A snug small room; a round table by a cheerful fire; an arm-chair
high-backed and old-fashioned, wherein sat the neatest imaginable
little elderly lady, in widow’s cap, black silk gown, and snowy muslin
apron; exactly like what I had fancied Mrs. Fairfax, only less stately
and milder looking. She was occupied in knitting; a large cat sat
demurely at her feet; nothing in short was wanting to complete the
beau-ideal of domestic comfort. A more reassuring introduction for a
new governess could scarcely be conceived; there was no grandeur to
overwhelm, no stateliness to embarrass; and then, as I entered, the old
lady got up and promptly and kindly came forward to meet me.

“How do you do, my dear? I am afraid you have had a tedious ride; John
drives so slowly; you must be cold, come to the fire.”

“Mrs. Fairfax, I suppose?” said I.

“Yes, you are right: do sit down.”

She conducted me to her own chair, and then began to remove my shawl
and untie my bonnet-strings; I begged she would not give herself so
much trouble.

“Oh, it is no trouble; I dare say your own hands are almost numbed with
cold. Leah, make a little hot negus and cut a sandwich or two: here are
the keys of the storeroom.”

And she produced from her pocket a most housewifely bunch of keys, and
delivered them to the servant.

“Now, then, draw nearer to the fire,” she continued. “You’ve brought
your luggage with you, haven’t you, my dear?”

“Yes, ma’am.”

“I’ll see it carried into your room,” she said, and bustled out.

“She treats me like a visitor,” thought I. “I little expected such a
reception; I anticipated only coldness and stiffness: this is not like
what I have heard of the treatment of governesses; but I must not exult
too soon.”

She returned; with her own hands cleared her knitting apparatus and a
book or two from the table, to make room for the tray which Leah now
brought, and then herself handed me the refreshments. I felt rather
confused at being the object of more attention than I had ever before
received, and, that too, shown by my employer and superior; but as she
did not herself seem to consider she was doing anything out of her
place, I thought it better to take her civilities quietly.

“Shall I have the pleasure of seeing Miss Fairfax to-night?” I asked,
when I had partaken of what she offered me.

“What did you say, my dear? I am a little deaf,” returned the good
lady, approaching her ear to my mouth.

I repeated the question more distinctly.

“Miss Fairfax? Oh, you mean Miss Varens! Varens is the name of your
future pupil.”

“Indeed! Then she is not your daughter?”

“No,—I have no family.”

I should have followed up my first inquiry, by asking in what way Miss
Varens was connected with her; but I recollected it was not polite to
ask too many questions: besides, I was sure to hear in time.

“I am so glad,” she continued, as she sat down opposite to me, and took
the cat on her knee; “I am so glad you are come; it will be quite
pleasant living here now with a companion. To be sure it is pleasant at
any time; for Thornfield is a fine old hall, rather neglected of late
years perhaps, but still it is a respectable place; yet you know in
winter-time one feels dreary quite alone in the best quarters. I say
alone—Leah is a nice girl to be sure, and John and his wife are very
decent people; but then you see they are only servants, and one can’t
converse with them on terms of equality: one must keep them at due
distance, for fear of losing one’s authority. I’m sure last winter (it
was a very severe one, if you recollect, and when it did not snow, it
rained and blew), not a creature but the butcher and postman came to
the house, from November till February; and I really got quite
melancholy with sitting night after night alone; I had Leah in to read
to me sometimes; but I don’t think the poor girl liked the task much:
she felt it confining. In spring and summer one got on better: sunshine
and long days make such a difference; and then, just at the
commencement of this autumn, little Adela Varens came and her nurse: a
child makes a house alive all at once; and now you are here I shall be
quite gay.”

My heart really warmed to the worthy lady as I heard her talk; and I
drew my chair a little nearer to her, and expressed my sincere wish
that she might find my company as agreeable as she anticipated.

“But I’ll not keep you sitting up late to-night,” said she; “it is on
the stroke of twelve now, and you have been travelling all day: you
must feel tired. If you have got your feet well warmed, I’ll show you
your bedroom. I’ve had the room next to mine prepared for you; it is
only a small apartment, but I thought you would like it better than one
of the large front chambers: to be sure they have finer furniture, but
they are so dreary and solitary, I never sleep in them myself.”

I thanked her for her considerate choice, and as I really felt fatigued
with my long journey, expressed my readiness to retire. She took her
candle, and I followed her from the room. First she went to see if the
hall-door was fastened; having taken the key from the lock, she led the
way upstairs. The steps and banisters were of oak; the staircase window
was high and latticed; both it and the long gallery into which the
bedroom doors opened looked as if they belonged to a church rather than
a house. A very chill and vault-like air pervaded the stairs and
gallery, suggesting cheerless ideas of space and solitude; and I was
glad, when finally ushered into my chamber, to find it of small
dimensions, and furnished in ordinary, modern style.

When Mrs. Fairfax had bidden me a kind good-night, and I had fastened
my door, gazed leisurely round, and in some measure effaced the eerie
impression made by that wide hall, that dark and spacious staircase,
and that long, cold gallery, by the livelier aspect of my little room,
I remembered that, after a day of bodily fatigue and mental anxiety, I
was now at last in safe haven. The impulse of gratitude swelled my
heart, and I knelt down at the bedside, and offered up thanks where
thanks were due; not forgetting, ere I rose, to implore aid on my
further path, and the power of meriting the kindness which seemed so
frankly offered me before it was earned. My couch had no thorns in it
that night; my solitary room no fears. At once weary and content, I
slept soon and soundly: when I awoke it was broad day.

The chamber looked such a bright little place to me as the sun shone in
between the gay blue chintz window curtains, showing papered walls and
a carpeted floor, so unlike the bare planks and stained plaster of
Lowood, that my spirits rose at the view. Externals have a great effect
on the young: I thought that a fairer era of life was beginning for me,
one that was to have its flowers and pleasures, as well as its thorns
and toils. My faculties, roused by the change of scene, the new field
offered to hope, seemed all astir. I cannot precisely define what they
expected, but it was something pleasant: not perhaps that day or that
month, but at an indefinite future period.

I rose; I dressed myself with care: obliged to be plain—for I had no
article of attire that was not made with extreme simplicity—I was still
by nature solicitous to be neat. It was not my habit to be disregardful
of appearance or careless of the impression I made: on the contrary, I
ever wished to look as well as I could, and to please as much as my
want of beauty would permit. I sometimes regretted that I was not
handsomer; I sometimes wished to have rosy cheeks, a straight nose, and
small cherry mouth; I desired to be tall, stately, and finely developed
in figure; I felt it a misfortune that I was so little, so pale, and
had features so irregular and so marked. And why had I these
aspirations and these regrets? It would be difficult to say: I could
not then distinctly say it to myself; yet I had a reason, and a
logical, natural reason too. However, when I had brushed my hair very
smooth, and put on my black frock—which, Quakerlike as it was, at least
had the merit of fitting to a nicety—and adjusted my clean white
tucker, I thought I should do respectably enough to appear before Mrs.
Fairfax, and that my new pupil would not at least recoil from me with
antipathy. Having opened my chamber window, and seen that I left all
things straight and neat on the toilet table, I ventured forth.

Traversing the long and matted gallery, I descended the slippery steps
of oak; then I gained the hall: I halted there a minute; I looked at
some pictures on the walls (one, I remember, represented a grim man in
a cuirass, and one a lady with powdered hair and a pearl necklace), at
a bronze lamp pendent from the ceiling, at a great clock whose case was
of oak curiously carved, and ebon black with time and rubbing.
Everything appeared very stately and imposing to me; but then I was so
little accustomed to grandeur. The hall-door, which was half of glass,
stood open; I stepped over the threshold. It was a fine autumn morning;
the early sun shone serenely on embrowned groves and still green
fields; advancing on to the lawn, I looked up and surveyed the front of
the mansion. It was three storeys high, of proportions not vast, though
considerable: a gentleman’s manor-house, not a nobleman’s seat:
battlements round the top gave it a picturesque look. Its grey front
stood out well from the background of a rookery, whose cawing tenants
were now on the wing: they flew over the lawn and grounds to alight in
a great meadow, from which these were separated by a sunk fence, and
where an array of mighty old thorn trees, strong, knotty, and broad as
oaks, at once explained the etymology of the mansion’s designation.
Farther off were hills: not so lofty as those round Lowood, nor so
craggy, nor so like barriers of separation from the living world; but
yet quiet and lonely hills enough, and seeming to embrace Thornfield
with a seclusion I had not expected to find existent so near the
stirring locality of Millcote. A little hamlet, whose roofs were blent
with trees, straggled up the side of one of these hills; the church of
the district stood nearer Thornfield: its old tower-top looked over a
knoll between the house and gates.

I was yet enjoying the calm prospect and pleasant fresh air, yet
listening with delight to the cawing of the rooks, yet surveying the
wide, hoary front of the hall, and thinking what a great place it was
for one lonely little dame like Mrs. Fairfax to inhabit, when that lady
appeared at the door.

“What! out already?” said she. “I see you are an early riser.” I went
up to her, and was received with an affable kiss and shake of the hand.

“How do you like Thornfield?” she asked. I told her I liked it very
much.

“Yes,” she said, “it is a pretty place; but I fear it will be getting
out of order, unless Mr. Rochester should take it into his head to come
and reside here permanently; or, at least, visit it rather oftener:
great houses and fine grounds require the presence of the proprietor.”

“Mr. Rochester!” I exclaimed. “Who is he?”

“The owner of Thornfield,” she responded quietly. “Did you not know he
was called Rochester?”

Of course I did not—I had never heard of him before; but the old lady
seemed to regard his existence as a universally understood fact, with
which everybody must be acquainted by instinct.

“I thought,” I continued, “Thornfield belonged to you.”

“To me? Bless you, child; what an idea! To me! I am only the
housekeeper—the manager. To be sure I am distantly related to the
Rochesters by the mother’s side, or at least my husband was; he was a
clergyman, incumbent of Hay—that little village yonder on the hill—and
that church near the gates was his. The present Mr. Rochester’s mother
was a Fairfax, and second cousin to my husband: but I never presume on
the connection—in fact, it is nothing to me; I consider myself quite in
the light of an ordinary housekeeper: my employer is always civil, and
I expect nothing more.”

“And the little girl—my pupil!”

“She is Mr. Rochester’s ward; he commissioned me to find a governess
for her. He intended to have her brought up in ——shire, I believe. Here
she comes, with her ‘bonne,’ as she calls her nurse.” The enigma then
was explained: this affable and kind little widow was no great dame;
but a dependent like myself. I did not like her the worse for that; on
the contrary, I felt better pleased than ever. The equality between her
and me was real; not the mere result of condescension on her part: so
much the better—my position was all the freer.

As I was meditating on this discovery, a little girl, followed by her
attendant, came running up the lawn. I looked at my pupil, who did not
at first appear to notice me: she was quite a child, perhaps seven or
eight years old, slightly built, with a pale, small-featured face, and
a redundancy of hair falling in curls to her waist.

“Good morning, Miss Adela,” said Mrs. Fairfax. “Come and speak to the
lady who is to teach you, and to make you a clever woman some day.” She
approached.

“C’est là ma gouvernante!” said she, pointing to me, and addressing her
nurse; who answered—

“Mais oui, certainement.”

“Are they foreigners?” I inquired, amazed at hearing the French
language.

“The nurse is a foreigner, and Adela was born on the Continent; and, I
believe, never left it till within six months ago. When she first came
here she could speak no English; now she can make shift to talk it a
little: I don’t understand her, she mixes it so with French; but you
will make out her meaning very well, I dare say.”

Fortunately I had had the advantage of being taught French by a French
lady; and as I had always made a point of conversing with Madame
Pierrot as often as I could, and had besides, during the last seven
years, learnt a portion of French by heart daily—applying myself to
take pains with my accent, and imitating as closely as possible the
pronunciation of my teacher, I had acquired a certain degree of
readiness and correctness in the language, and was not likely to be
much at a loss with Mademoiselle Adela. She came and shook hands with
me when she heard that I was her governess; and as I led her in to
breakfast, I addressed some phrases to her in her own tongue: she
replied briefly at first, but after we were seated at the table, and
she had examined me some ten minutes with her large hazel eyes, she
suddenly commenced chattering fluently.

“Ah!” cried she, in French, “you speak my language as well as Mr.
Rochester does: I can talk to you as I can to him, and so can Sophie.
She will be glad: nobody here understands her: Madame Fairfax is all
English. Sophie is my nurse; she came with me over the sea in a great
ship with a chimney that smoked—how it did smoke!—and I was sick, and
so was Sophie, and so was Mr. Rochester. Mr. Rochester lay down on a
sofa in a pretty room called the salon, and Sophie and I had little
beds in another place. I nearly fell out of mine; it was like a shelf.
And Mademoiselle—what is your name?”

“Eyre—Jane Eyre.”

“Aire? Bah! I cannot say it. Well, our ship stopped in the morning,
before it was quite daylight, at a great city—a huge city, with very
dark houses and all smoky; not at all like the pretty clean town I came
from; and Mr. Rochester carried me in his arms over a plank to the
land, and Sophie came after, and we all got into a coach, which took us
to a beautiful large house, larger than this and finer, called an
hotel. We stayed there nearly a week: I and Sophie used to walk every
day in a great green place full of trees, called the Park; and there
were many children there besides me, and a pond with beautiful birds in
it, that I fed with crumbs.”

“Can you understand her when she runs on so fast?” asked Mrs. Fairfax.

I understood her very well, for I had been accustomed to the fluent
tongue of Madame Pierrot.

“I wish,” continued the good lady, “you would ask her a question or two
about her parents: I wonder if she remembers them?”

“Adèle,” I inquired, “with whom did you live when you were in that
pretty clean town you spoke of?”

“I lived long ago with mama; but she is gone to the Holy Virgin. Mama
used to teach me to dance and sing, and to say verses. A great many
gentlemen and ladies came to see mama, and I used to dance before them,
or to sit on their knees and sing to them: I liked it. Shall I let you
hear me sing now?”

She had finished her breakfast, so I permitted her to give a specimen
of her accomplishments. Descending from her chair, she came and placed
herself on my knee; then, folding her little hands demurely before her,
shaking back her curls and lifting her eyes to the ceiling, she
commenced singing a song from some opera. It was the strain of a
forsaken lady, who, after bewailing the perfidy of her lover, calls
pride to her aid; desires her attendant to deck her in her brightest
jewels and richest robes, and resolves to meet the false one that night
at a ball, and prove to him, by the gaiety of her demeanour, how little
his desertion has affected her.

The subject seemed strangely chosen for an infant singer; but I suppose
the point of the exhibition lay in hearing the notes of love and
jealousy warbled with the lisp of childhood; and in very bad taste that
point was: at least I thought so.

Adèle sang the canzonette tunefully enough, and with the _naïveté_ of
her age. This achieved, she jumped from my knee and said, “Now,
Mademoiselle, I will repeat you some poetry.”

Assuming an attitude, she began, “La Ligue des Rats: fable de La
Fontaine.” She then declaimed the little piece with an attention to
punctuation and emphasis, a flexibility of voice and an appropriateness
of gesture, very unusual indeed at her age, and which proved she had
been carefully trained.

“Was it your mama who taught you that piece?” I asked.

“Yes, and she just used to say it in this way: ‘Qu’avez vous donc? lui
dit un de ces rats; parlez!’ She made me lift my hand—so—to remind me
to raise my voice at the question. Now shall I dance for you?”

“No, that will do: but after your mama went to the Holy Virgin, as you
say, with whom did you live then?”

“With Madame Frédéric and her husband: she took care of me, but she is
nothing related to me. I think she is poor, for she had not so fine a
house as mama. I was not long there. Mr. Rochester asked me if I would
like to go and live with him in England, and I said yes; for I knew Mr.
Rochester before I knew Madame Frédéric, and he was always kind to me
and gave me pretty dresses and toys: but you see he has not kept his
word, for he has brought me to England, and now he is gone back again
himself, and I never see him.”

After breakfast, Adèle and I withdrew to the library, which room, it
appears, Mr. Rochester had directed should be used as the schoolroom.
Most of the books were locked up behind glass doors; but there was one
bookcase left open containing everything that could be needed in the
way of elementary works, and several volumes of light literature,
poetry, biography, travels, a few romances, &c. I suppose he had
considered that these were all the governess would require for her
private perusal; and, indeed, they contented me amply for the present;
compared with the scanty pickings I had now and then been able to glean
at Lowood, they seemed to offer an abundant harvest of entertainment
and information. In this room, too, there was a cabinet piano, quite
new and of superior tone; also an easel for painting and a pair of
globes.

I found my pupil sufficiently docile, though disinclined to apply: she
had not been used to regular occupation of any kind. I felt it would be
injudicious to confine her too much at first; so, when I had talked to
her a great deal, and got her to learn a little, and when the morning
had advanced to noon, I allowed her to return to her nurse. I then
proposed to occupy myself till dinner-time in drawing some little
sketches for her use.

As I was going upstairs to fetch my portfolio and pencils, Mrs. Fairfax
called to me: “Your morning school-hours are over now, I suppose,” said
she. She was in a room the folding-doors of which stood open: I went in
when she addressed me. It was a large, stately apartment, with purple
chairs and curtains, a Turkey carpet, walnut-panelled walls, one vast
window rich in stained glass, and a lofty ceiling, nobly moulded. Mrs.
Fairfax was dusting some vases of fine purple spar, which stood on a
sideboard.

“What a beautiful room!” I exclaimed, as I looked round; for I had
never before seen any half so imposing.

“Yes; this is the dining-room. I have just opened the window, to let in
a little air and sunshine; for everything gets so damp in apartments
that are seldom inhabited; the drawing-room yonder feels like a vault.”

She pointed to a wide arch corresponding to the window, and hung like
it with a Tyrian-dyed curtain, now looped up. Mounting to it by two
broad steps, and looking through, I thought I caught a glimpse of a
fairy place, so bright to my novice-eyes appeared the view beyond. Yet
it was merely a very pretty drawing-room, and within it a boudoir, both
spread with white carpets, on which seemed laid brilliant garlands of
flowers; both ceiled with snowy mouldings of white grapes and
vine-leaves, beneath which glowed in rich contrast crimson couches and
ottomans; while the ornaments on the pale Parian mantelpiece were of
sparkling Bohemian glass, ruby red; and between the windows large
mirrors repeated the general blending of snow and fire.

“In what order you keep these rooms, Mrs. Fairfax!” said I. “No dust,
no canvas coverings: except that the air feels chilly, one would think
they were inhabited daily.”

“Why, Miss Eyre, though Mr. Rochester’s visits here are rare, they are
always sudden and unexpected; and as I observed that it put him out to
find everything swathed up, and to have a bustle of arrangement on his
arrival, I thought it best to keep the rooms in readiness.”

“Is Mr. Rochester an exacting, fastidious sort of man?”

“Not particularly so; but he has a gentleman’s tastes and habits, and
he expects to have things managed in conformity to them.”

“Do you like him? Is he generally liked?”

“Oh, yes; the family have always been respected here. Almost all the
land in this neighbourhood, as far as you can see, has belonged to the
Rochesters time out of mind.”

“Well, but, leaving his land out of the question, do you like him? Is
he liked for himself?”

“_I_ have no cause to do otherwise than like him; and I believe he is
considered a just and liberal landlord by his tenants: but he has never
lived much amongst them.”

“But has he no peculiarities? What, in short, is his character?”

“Oh! his character is unimpeachable, I suppose. He is rather peculiar,
perhaps: he has travelled a great deal, and seen a great deal of the
world, I should think. I dare say he is clever, but I never had much
conversation with him.”

“In what way is he peculiar?”

“I don’t know—it is not easy to describe—nothing striking, but you feel
it when he speaks to you; you cannot be always sure whether he is in
jest or earnest, whether he is pleased or the contrary; you don’t
thoroughly understand him, in short—at least, I don’t: but it is of no
consequence, he is a very good master.”

This was all the account I got from Mrs. Fairfax of her employer and
mine. There are people who seem to have no notion of sketching a
character, or observing and describing salient points, either in
persons or things: the good lady evidently belonged to this class; my
queries puzzled, but did not draw her out. Mr. Rochester was Mr.
Rochester in her eyes; a gentleman, a landed proprietor—nothing more:
she inquired and searched no further, and evidently wondered at my wish
to gain a more definite notion of his identity.

When we left the dining-room, she proposed to show me over the rest of
the house; and I followed her upstairs and downstairs, admiring as I
went; for all was well arranged and handsome. The large front chambers
I thought especially grand: and some of the third-storey rooms, though
dark and low, were interesting from their air of antiquity. The
furniture once appropriated to the lower apartments had from time to
time been removed here, as fashions changed: and the imperfect light
entering by their narrow casement showed bedsteads of a hundred years
old; chests in oak or walnut, looking, with their strange carvings of
palm branches and cherubs’ heads, like types of the Hebrew ark; rows of
venerable chairs, high-backed and narrow; stools still more antiquated,
on whose cushioned tops were yet apparent traces of half-effaced
embroideries, wrought by fingers that for two generations had been
coffin-dust. All these relics gave to the third storey of Thornfield
Hall the aspect of a home of the past: a shrine of memory. I liked the
hush, the gloom, the quaintness of these retreats in the day; but I by
no means coveted a night’s repose on one of those wide and heavy beds:
shut in, some of them, with doors of oak; shaded, others, with wrought
old English hangings crusted with thick work, portraying effigies of
strange flowers, and stranger birds, and strangest human beings,—all
which would have looked strange, indeed, by the pallid gleam of
moonlight.

“Do the servants sleep in these rooms?” I asked.

“No; they occupy a range of smaller apartments to the back; no one ever
sleeps here: one would almost say that, if there were a ghost at
Thornfield Hall, this would be its haunt.”

“So I think: you have no ghost, then?”

“None that I ever heard of,” returned Mrs. Fairfax, smiling.

“Nor any traditions of one? no legends or ghost stories?”

“I believe not. And yet it is said the Rochesters have been rather a
violent than a quiet race in their time: perhaps, though, that is the
reason they rest tranquilly in their graves now.”

“Yes—‘after life’s fitful fever they sleep well,’” I muttered. “Where
are you going now, Mrs. Fairfax?” for she was moving away.

“On to the leads; will you come and see the view from thence?” I
followed still, up a very narrow staircase to the attics, and thence by
a ladder and through a trap-door to the roof of the hall. I was now on
a level with the crow colony, and could see into their nests. Leaning
over the battlements and looking far down, I surveyed the grounds laid
out like a map: the bright and velvet lawn closely girdling the grey
base of the mansion; the field, wide as a park, dotted with its ancient
timber; the wood, dun and sere, divided by a path visibly overgrown,
greener with moss than the trees were with foliage; the church at the
gates, the road, the tranquil hills, all reposing in the autumn day’s
sun; the horizon bounded by a propitious sky, azure, marbled with
pearly white. No feature in the scene was extraordinary, but all was
pleasing. When I turned from it and repassed the trap-door, I could
scarcely see my way down the ladder; the attic seemed black as a vault
compared with that arch of blue air to which I had been looking up, and
to that sunlit scene of grove, pasture, and green hill, of which the
hall was the centre, and over which I had been gazing with delight.

Mrs. Fairfax stayed behind a moment to fasten the trap-door; I, by dint
of groping, found the outlet from the attic, and proceeded to descend
the narrow garret staircase. I lingered in the long passage to which
this led, separating the front and back rooms of the third storey:
narrow, low, and dim, with only one little window at the far end, and
looking, with its two rows of small black doors all shut, like a
corridor in some Bluebeard’s castle.

While I paced softly on, the last sound I expected to hear in so still
a region, a laugh, struck my ear. It was a curious laugh; distinct,
formal, mirthless. I stopped: the sound ceased, only for an instant; it
began again, louder: for at first, though distinct, it was very low. It
passed off in a clamorous peal that seemed to wake an echo in every
lonely chamber; though it originated but in one, and I could have
pointed out the door whence the accents issued.

“Mrs. Fairfax!” I called out: for I now heard her descending the great
stairs. “Did you hear that loud laugh? Who is it?”

“Some of the servants, very likely,” she answered: “perhaps Grace
Poole.”

“Did you hear it?” I again inquired.

“Yes, plainly: I often hear her: she sews in one of these rooms.
Sometimes Leah is with her; they are frequently noisy together.”

The laugh was repeated in its low, syllabic tone, and terminated in an
odd murmur.

“Grace!” exclaimed Mrs. Fairfax.

I really did not expect any Grace to answer; for the laugh was as
tragic, as preternatural a laugh as any I ever heard; and, but that it
was high noon, and that no circumstance of ghostliness accompanied the
curious cachinnation; but that neither scene nor season favoured fear,
I should have been superstitiously afraid. However, the event showed me
I was a fool for entertaining a sense even of surprise.

The door nearest me opened, and a servant came out,—a woman of between
thirty and forty; a set, square-made figure, red-haired, and with a
hard, plain face: any apparition less romantic or less ghostly could
scarcely be conceived.

“Too much noise, Grace,” said Mrs. Fairfax. “Remember directions!”
Grace curtseyed silently and went in.

“She is a person we have to sew and assist Leah in her housemaid’s
work,” continued the widow; “not altogether unobjectionable in some
points, but she does well enough. By-the-bye, how have you got on with
your new pupil this morning?”

The conversation, thus turned on Adèle, continued till we reached the
light and cheerful region below. Adèle came running to meet us in the
hall, exclaiming—

“Mesdames, vous êtes servies!” adding, “J’ai bien faim, moi!”

We found dinner ready, and waiting for us in Mrs. Fairfax’s room.




CHAPTER XII


The promise of a smooth career, which my first calm introduction to
Thornfield Hall seemed to pledge, was not belied on a longer
acquaintance with the place and its inmates. Mrs. Fairfax turned out to
be what she appeared, a placid-tempered, kind-natured woman, of
competent education and average intelligence. My pupil was a lively
child, who had been spoilt and indulged, and therefore was sometimes
wayward; but as she was committed entirely to my care, and no
injudicious interference from any quarter ever thwarted my plans for
her improvement, she soon forgot her little freaks, and became obedient
and teachable. She had no great talents, no marked traits of character,
no peculiar development of feeling or taste which raised her one inch
above the ordinary level of childhood; but neither had she any
deficiency or vice which sunk her below it. She made reasonable
progress, entertained for me a vivacious, though perhaps not very
profound, affection; and by her simplicity, gay prattle, and efforts to
please, inspired me, in return, with a degree of attachment sufficient
to make us both content in each other’s society.

This, _par parenthèse_, will be thought cool language by persons who
entertain solemn doctrines about the angelic nature of children, and
the duty of those charged with their education to conceive for them an
idolatrous devotion: but I am not writing to flatter parental egotism,
to echo cant, or prop up humbug; I am merely telling the truth. I felt
a conscientious solicitude for Adèle’s welfare and progress, and a
quiet liking for her little self: just as I cherished towards Mrs.
Fairfax a thankfulness for her kindness, and a pleasure in her society
proportionate to the tranquil regard she had for me, and the moderation
of her mind and character.

Anybody may blame me who likes, when I add further, that, now and then,
when I took a walk by myself in the grounds; when I went down to the
gates and looked through them along the road; or when, while Adèle
played with her nurse, and Mrs. Fairfax made jellies in the storeroom,
I climbed the three staircases, raised the trap-door of the attic, and
having reached the leads, looked out afar over sequestered field and
hill, and along dim sky-line—that then I longed for a power of vision
which might overpass that limit; which might reach the busy world,
towns, regions full of life I had heard of but never seen—that then I
desired more of practical experience than I possessed; more of
intercourse with my kind, of acquaintance with variety of character,
than was here within my reach. I valued what was good in Mrs. Fairfax,
and what was good in Adèle; but I believed in the existence of other
and more vivid kinds of goodness, and what I believed in I wished to
behold.

Who blames me? Many, no doubt; and I shall be called discontented. I
could not help it: the restlessness was in my nature; it agitated me to
pain sometimes. Then my sole relief was to walk along the corridor of
the third storey, backwards and forwards, safe in the silence and
solitude of the spot, and allow my mind’s eye to dwell on whatever
bright visions rose before it—and, certainly, they were many and
glowing; to let my heart be heaved by the exultant movement, which,
while it swelled it in trouble, expanded it with life; and, best of
all, to open my inward ear to a tale that was never ended—a tale my
imagination created, and narrated continuously; quickened with all of
incident, life, fire, feeling, that I desired and had not in my actual
existence.

It is in vain to say human beings ought to be satisfied with
tranquillity: they must have action; and they will make it if they
cannot find it. Millions are condemned to a stiller doom than mine, and
millions are in silent revolt against their lot. Nobody knows how many
rebellions besides political rebellions ferment in the masses of life
which people earth. Women are supposed to be very calm generally: but
women feel just as men feel; they need exercise for their faculties,
and a field for their efforts, as much as their brothers do; they
suffer from too rigid a restraint, too absolute a stagnation, precisely
as men would suffer; and it is narrow-minded in their more privileged
fellow-creatures to say that they ought to confine themselves to making
puddings and knitting stockings, to playing on the piano and
embroidering bags. It is thoughtless to condemn them, or laugh at them,
if they seek to do more or learn more than custom has pronounced
necessary for their sex.

When thus alone, I not unfrequently heard Grace Poole’s laugh: the same
peal, the same low, slow ha! ha! which, when first heard, had thrilled
me: I heard, too, her eccentric murmurs; stranger than her laugh. There
were days when she was quite silent; but there were others when I could
not account for the sounds she made. Sometimes I saw her: she would
come out of her room with a basin, or a plate, or a tray in her hand,
go down to the kitchen and shortly return, generally (oh, romantic
reader, forgive me for telling the plain truth!) bearing a pot of
porter. Her appearance always acted as a damper to the curiosity raised
by her oral oddities: hard-featured and staid, she had no point to
which interest could attach. I made some attempts to draw her into
conversation, but she seemed a person of few words: a monosyllabic
reply usually cut short every effort of that sort.

The other members of the household, viz., John and his wife, Leah the
housemaid, and Sophie the French nurse, were decent people; but in no
respect remarkable; with Sophie I used to talk French, and sometimes I
asked her questions about her native country; but she was not of a
descriptive or narrative turn, and generally gave such vapid and
confused answers as were calculated rather to check than encourage
inquiry.

October, November, December passed away. One afternoon in January, Mrs.
Fairfax had begged a holiday for Adèle, because she had a cold; and, as
Adèle seconded the request with an ardour that reminded me how precious
occasional holidays had been to me in my own childhood, I accorded it,
deeming that I did well in showing pliability on the point. It was a
fine, calm day, though very cold; I was tired of sitting still in the
library through a whole long morning: Mrs. Fairfax had just written a
letter which was waiting to be posted, so I put on my bonnet and cloak
and volunteered to carry it to Hay; the distance, two miles, would be a
pleasant winter afternoon walk. Having seen Adèle comfortably seated in
her little chair by Mrs. Fairfax’s parlour fireside, and given her her
best wax doll (which I usually kept enveloped in silver paper in a
drawer) to play with, and a story-book for change of amusement; and
having replied to her “Revenez bientôt, ma bonne amie, ma chère Mdlle.
Jeannette,” with a kiss I set out.

The ground was hard, the air was still, my road was lonely; I walked
fast till I got warm, and then I walked slowly to enjoy and analyse the
species of pleasure brooding for me in the hour and situation. It was
three o’clock; the church bell tolled as I passed under the belfry: the
charm of the hour lay in its approaching dimness, in the low-gliding
and pale-beaming sun. I was a mile from Thornfield, in a lane noted for
wild roses in summer, for nuts and blackberries in autumn, and even now
possessing a few coral treasures in hips and haws, but whose best
winter delight lay in its utter solitude and leafless repose. If a
breath of air stirred, it made no sound here; for there was not a
holly, not an evergreen to rustle, and the stripped hawthorn and hazel
bushes were as still as the white, worn stones which causewayed the
middle of the path. Far and wide, on each side, there were only fields,
where no cattle now browsed; and the little brown birds, which stirred
occasionally in the hedge, looked like single russet leaves that had
forgotten to drop.

This lane inclined up-hill all the way to Hay; having reached the
middle, I sat down on a stile which led thence into a field. Gathering
my mantle about me, and sheltering my hands in my muff, I did not feel
the cold, though it froze keenly; as was attested by a sheet of ice
covering the causeway, where a little brooklet, now congealed, had
overflowed after a rapid thaw some days since. From my seat I could
look down on Thornfield: the grey and battlemented hall was the
principal object in the vale below me; its woods and dark rookery rose
against the west. I lingered till the sun went down amongst the trees,
and sank crimson and clear behind them. I then turned eastward.

On the hill-top above me sat the rising moon; pale yet as a cloud, but
brightening momentarily, she looked over Hay, which, half lost in
trees, sent up a blue smoke from its few chimneys: it was yet a mile
distant, but in the absolute hush I could hear plainly its thin murmurs
of life. My ear, too, felt the flow of currents; in what dales and
depths I could not tell: but there were many hills beyond Hay, and
doubtless many becks threading their passes. That evening calm betrayed
alike the tinkle of the nearest streams, the sough of the most remote.

A rude noise broke on these fine ripplings and whisperings, at once so
far away and so clear: a positive tramp, tramp, a metallic clatter,
which effaced the soft wave-wanderings; as, in a picture, the solid
mass of a crag, or the rough boles of a great oak, drawn in dark and
strong on the foreground, efface the aërial distance of azure hill,
sunny horizon, and blended clouds where tint melts into tint.

The din was on the causeway: a horse was coming; the windings of the
lane yet hid it, but it approached. I was just leaving the stile; yet,
as the path was narrow, I sat still to let it go by. In those days I
was young, and all sorts of fancies bright and dark tenanted my mind:
the memories of nursery stories were there amongst other rubbish; and
when they recurred, maturing youth added to them a vigour and vividness
beyond what childhood could give. As this horse approached, and as I
watched for it to appear through the dusk, I remembered certain of
Bessie’s tales, wherein figured a North-of-England spirit called a
“Gytrash,” which, in the form of horse, mule, or large dog, haunted
solitary ways, and sometimes came upon belated travellers, as this
horse was now coming upon me.

It was very near, but not yet in sight; when, in addition to the tramp,
tramp, I heard a rush under the hedge, and close down by the hazel
stems glided a great dog, whose black and white colour made him a
distinct object against the trees. It was exactly one form of Bessie’s
Gytrash—a lion-like creature with long hair and a huge head: it passed
me, however, quietly enough; not staying to look up, with strange
pretercanine eyes, in my face, as I half expected it would. The horse
followed,—a tall steed, and on its back a rider. The man, the human
being, broke the spell at once. Nothing ever rode the Gytrash: it was
always alone; and goblins, to my notions, though they might tenant the
dumb carcasses of beasts, could scarce covet shelter in the commonplace
human form. No Gytrash was this,—only a traveller taking the short cut
to Millcote. He passed, and I went on; a few steps, and I turned: a
sliding sound and an exclamation of “What the deuce is to do now?” and
a clattering tumble, arrested my attention. Man and horse were down;
they had slipped on the sheet of ice which glazed the causeway. The dog
came bounding back, and seeing his master in a predicament, and hearing
the horse groan, barked till the evening hills echoed the sound, which
was deep in proportion to his magnitude. He snuffed round the prostrate
group, and then he ran up to me; it was all he could do,—there was no
other help at hand to summon. I obeyed him, and walked down to the
traveller, by this time struggling himself free of his steed. His
efforts were so vigorous, I thought he could not be much hurt; but I
asked him the question—

“Are you injured, sir?”

I think he was swearing, but am not certain; however, he was
pronouncing some formula which prevented him from replying to me
directly.

“Can I do anything?” I asked again.

“You must just stand on one side,” he answered as he rose, first to his
knees, and then to his feet. I did; whereupon began a heaving,
stamping, clattering process, accompanied by a barking and baying which
removed me effectually some yards’ distance; but I would not be driven
quite away till I saw the event. This was finally fortunate; the horse
was re-established, and the dog was silenced with a “Down, Pilot!” The
traveller now, stooping, felt his foot and leg, as if trying whether
they were sound; apparently something ailed them, for he halted to the
stile whence I had just risen, and sat down.

I was in the mood for being useful, or at least officious, I think, for
I now drew near him again.

“If you are hurt, and want help, sir, I can fetch some one either from
Thornfield Hall or from Hay.”

“Thank you: I shall do: I have no broken bones,—only a sprain;” and
again he stood up and tried his foot, but the result extorted an
involuntary “Ugh!”

Something of daylight still lingered, and the moon was waxing bright: I
could see him plainly. His figure was enveloped in a riding cloak, fur
collared and steel clasped; its details were not apparent, but I traced
the general points of middle height and considerable breadth of chest.
He had a dark face, with stern features and a heavy brow; his eyes and
gathered eyebrows looked ireful and thwarted just now; he was past
youth, but had not reached middle-age; perhaps he might be thirty-five.
I felt no fear of him, and but little shyness. Had he been a handsome,
heroic-looking young gentleman, I should not have dared to stand thus
questioning him against his will, and offering my services unasked. I
had hardly ever seen a handsome youth; never in my life spoken to one.
I had a theoretical reverence and homage for beauty, elegance,
gallantry, fascination; but had I met those qualities incarnate in
masculine shape, I should have known instinctively that they neither
had nor could have sympathy with anything in me, and should have
shunned them as one would fire, lightning, or anything else that is
bright but antipathetic.

If even this stranger had smiled and been good-humoured to me when I
addressed him; if he had put off my offer of assistance gaily and with
thanks, I should have gone on my way and not felt any vocation to renew
inquiries: but the frown, the roughness of the traveller, set me at my
ease: I retained my station when he waved to me to go, and announced—

“I cannot think of leaving you, sir, at so late an hour, in this
solitary lane, till I see you are fit to mount your horse.”

He looked at me when I said this; he had hardly turned his eyes in my
direction before.

“I should think you ought to be at home yourself,” said he, “if you
have a home in this neighbourhood: where do you come from?”

“From just below; and I am not at all afraid of being out late when it
is moonlight: I will run over to Hay for you with pleasure, if you wish
it: indeed, I am going there to post a letter.”

“You live just below—do you mean at that house with the battlements?”
pointing to Thornfield Hall, on which the moon cast a hoary gleam,
bringing it out distinct and pale from the woods that, by contrast with
the western sky, now seemed one mass of shadow.

“Yes, sir.”

“Whose house is it?”

“Mr. Rochester’s.”

“Do you know Mr. Rochester?”

“No, I have never seen him.”

“He is not resident, then?”

“No.”

“Can you tell me where he is?”

“I cannot.”

“You are not a servant at the hall, of course. You are—” He stopped,
ran his eye over my dress, which, as usual, was quite simple: a black
merino cloak, a black beaver bonnet; neither of them half fine enough
for a lady’s-maid. He seemed puzzled to decide what I was; I helped
him.

“I am the governess.”

“Ah, the governess!” he repeated; “deuce take me, if I had not
forgotten! The governess!” and again my raiment underwent scrutiny. In
two minutes he rose from the stile: his face expressed pain when he
tried to move.

“I cannot commission you to fetch help,” he said; “but you may help me
a little yourself, if you will be so kind.”

“Yes, sir.”

“You have not an umbrella that I can use as a stick?”

“No.”

“Try to get hold of my horse’s bridle and lead him to me: you are not
afraid?”

I should have been afraid to touch a horse when alone, but when told to
do it, I was disposed to obey. I put down my muff on the stile, and
went up to the tall steed; I endeavoured to catch the bridle, but it
was a spirited thing, and would not let me come near its head; I made
effort on effort, though in vain: meantime, I was mortally afraid of
its trampling fore-feet. The traveller waited and watched for some
time, and at last he laughed.


I was mortally afraid of its trampling forefeet

“I see,” he said, “the mountain will never be brought to Mahomet, so
all you can do is to aid Mahomet to go to the mountain; I must beg of
you to come here.”

I came. “Excuse me,” he continued: “necessity compels me to make you
useful.” He laid a heavy hand on my shoulder, and leaning on me with
some stress, limped to his horse. Having once caught the bridle, he
mastered it directly and sprang to his saddle; grimacing grimly as he
made the effort, for it wrenched his sprain.

“Now,” said he, releasing his under lip from a hard bite, “just hand me
my whip; it lies there under the hedge.”

I sought it and found it.

“Thank you; now make haste with the letter to Hay, and return as fast
as you can.”

A touch of a spurred heel made his horse first start and rear, and then
bound away; the dog rushed in his traces; all three vanished,

“Like heath that, in the wilderness,
    The wild wind whirls away.”


I took up my muff and walked on. The incident had occurred and was gone
for me: it _was_ an incident of no moment, no romance, no interest in a
sense; yet it marked with change one single hour of a monotonous life.
My help had been needed and claimed; I had given it: I was pleased to
have done something; trivial, transitory though the deed was, it was
yet an active thing, and I was weary of an existence all passive. The
new face, too, was like a new picture introduced to the gallery of
memory; and it was dissimilar to all the others hanging there: firstly,
because it was masculine; and, secondly, because it was dark, strong,
and stern. I had it still before me when I entered Hay, and slipped the
letter into the post-office; I saw it as I walked fast down-hill all
the way home. When I came to the stile, I stopped a minute, looked
round and listened, with an idea that a horse’s hoofs might ring on the
causeway again, and that a rider in a cloak, and a Gytrash-like
Newfoundland dog, might be again apparent: I saw only the hedge and a
pollard willow before me, rising up still and straight to meet the
moonbeams; I heard only the faintest waft of wind roaming fitful among
the trees round Thornfield, a mile distant; and when I glanced down in
the direction of the murmur, my eye, traversing the hall-front, caught
a light kindling in a window: it reminded me that I was late, and I
hurried on.

I did not like re-entering Thornfield. To pass its threshold was to
return to stagnation; to cross the silent hall, to ascend the darksome
staircase, to seek my own lonely little room, and then to meet tranquil
Mrs. Fairfax, and spend the long winter evening with her, and her only,
was to quell wholly the faint excitement wakened by my walk,—to slip
again over my faculties the viewless fetters of an uniform and too
still existence; of an existence whose very privileges of security and
ease I was becoming incapable of appreciating. What good it would have
done me at that time to have been tossed in the storms of an uncertain
struggling life, and to have been taught by rough and bitter experience
to long for the calm amidst which I now repined! Yes, just as much good
as it would do a man tired of sitting still in a “too easy chair” to
take a long walk: and just as natural was the wish to stir, under my
circumstances, as it would be under his.

I lingered at the gates; I lingered on the lawn; I paced backwards and
forwards on the pavement; the shutters of the glass door were closed; I
could not see into the interior; and both my eyes and spirit seemed
drawn from the gloomy house—from the grey hollow filled with rayless
cells, as it appeared to me—to that sky expanded before me,—a blue sea
absolved from taint of cloud; the moon ascending it in solemn march;
her orb seeming to look up as she left the hill-tops, from behind which
she had come, far and farther below her, and aspired to the zenith,
midnight dark in its fathomless depth and measureless distance; and for
those trembling stars that followed her course; they made my heart
tremble, my veins glow when I viewed them. Little things recall us to
earth; the clock struck in the hall; that sufficed; I turned from moon
and stars, opened a side-door, and went in.

The hall was not dark, nor yet was it lit, only by the high-hung bronze
lamp; a warm glow suffused both it and the lower steps of the oak
staircase. This ruddy shine issued from the great dining-room, whose
two-leaved door stood open, and showed a genial fire in the grate,
glancing on marble hearth and brass fire-irons, and revealing purple
draperies and polished furniture, in the most pleasant radiance. It
revealed, too, a group near the mantelpiece: I had scarcely caught it,
and scarcely become aware of a cheerful mingling of voices, amongst
which I seemed to distinguish the tones of Adèle, when the door closed.

I hastened to Mrs. Fairfax’s room; there was a fire there too, but no
candle, and no Mrs. Fairfax. Instead, all alone, sitting upright on the
rug, and gazing with gravity at the blaze, I beheld a great black and
white long-haired dog, just like the Gytrash of the lane. It was so
like it that I went forward and said—“Pilot,” and the thing got up and
came to me and snuffed me. I caressed him, and he wagged his great
tail; but he looked an eerie creature to be alone with, and I could not
tell whence he had come. I rang the bell, for I wanted a candle; and I
wanted, too, to get an account of this visitant. Leah entered.

“What dog is this?”

“He came with master.”

“With whom?”

“With master—Mr. Rochester—he is just arrived.”

“Indeed! and is Mrs. Fairfax with him?”

“Yes, and Miss Adèle; they are in the dining-room, and John is gone for
a surgeon; for master has had an accident; his horse fell and his ankle
is sprained.”

“Did the horse fall in Hay Lane?”

“Yes, coming down-hill; it slipped on some ice.”

“Ah! Bring me a candle will you Leah?”

Leah brought it; she entered, followed by Mrs. Fairfax, who repeated
the news; adding that Mr. Carter the surgeon was come, and was now with
Mr. Rochester: then she hurried out to give orders about tea, and I
went upstairs to take off my things.




CHAPTER XIII


Mr. Rochester, it seems, by the surgeon’s orders, went to bed early
that night; nor did he rise soon next morning. When he did come down,
it was to attend to business: his agent and some of his tenants were
arrived, and waiting to speak with him.

Adèle and I had now to vacate the library: it would be in daily
requisition as a reception-room for callers. A fire was lit in an
apartment upstairs, and there I carried our books, and arranged it for
the future schoolroom. I discerned in the course of the morning that
Thornfield Hall was a changed place: no longer silent as a church, it
echoed every hour or two to a knock at the door, or a clang of the
bell; steps, too, often traversed the hall, and new voices spoke in
different keys below; a rill from the outer world was flowing through
it; it had a master: for my part, I liked it better.

Adèle was not easy to teach that day; she could not apply: she kept
running to the door and looking over the banisters to see if she could
get a glimpse of Mr. Rochester; then she coined pretexts to go
downstairs, in order, as I shrewdly suspected, to visit the library,
where I knew she was not wanted; then, when I got a little angry, and
made her sit still, she continued to talk incessantly of her “ami,
Monsieur Edouard Fairfax _de_ Rochester,” as she dubbed him (I had not
before heard his prenomens), and to conjecture what presents he had
brought her: for it appears he had intimated the night before, that
when his luggage came from Millcote, there would be found amongst it a
little box in whose contents she had an interest.

“Et cela doit signifier,” said she, “qu’il y aura là dedans un cadeau
pour moi, et peut-être pour vous aussi, mademoiselle. Monsieur a parlé
de vous: il m’a demandé le nom de ma gouvernante, et si elle n’était
pas une petite personne, assez mince et un peu pâle. J’ai dit qu’oui:
car c’est vrai, n’est-ce pas, mademoiselle?”

I and my pupil dined as usual in Mrs. Fairfax’s parlour; the afternoon
was wild and snowy, and we passed it in the schoolroom. At dark I
allowed Adèle to put away books and work, and to run downstairs; for,
from the comparative silence below, and from the cessation of appeals
to the door-bell, I conjectured that Mr. Rochester was now at liberty.
Left alone, I walked to the window; but nothing was to be seen thence:
twilight and snowflakes together thickened the air, and hid the very
shrubs on the lawn. I let down the curtain and went back to the
fireside.

In the clear embers I was tracing a view, not unlike a picture I
remembered to have seen of the castle of Heidelberg, on the Rhine, when
Mrs. Fairfax came in, breaking up by her entrance the fiery mosaic I
had been piercing together, and scattering too some heavy unwelcome
thoughts that were beginning to throng on my solitude.

“Mr. Rochester would be glad if you and your pupil would take tea with
him in the drawing-room this evening,” said she: “he has been so much
engaged all day that he could not ask to see you before.”

“When is his tea-time?” I inquired.

“Oh, at six o’clock: he keeps early hours in the country. You had
better change your frock now; I will go with you and fasten it. Here is
a candle.”

“Is it necessary to change my frock?”

“Yes, you had better: I always dress for the evening when Mr. Rochester
is here.”

This additional ceremony seemed somewhat stately; however, I repaired
to my room, and, with Mrs. Fairfax’s aid, replaced my black stuff dress
by one of black silk; the best and the only additional one I had,
except one of light grey, which, in my Lowood notions of the toilette,
I thought too fine to be worn, except on first-rate occasions.

“You want a brooch,” said Mrs. Fairfax. I had a single little pearl
ornament which Miss Temple gave me as a parting keepsake: I put it on,
and then we went downstairs. Unused as I was to strangers, it was
rather a trial to appear thus formally summoned in Mr. Rochester’s
presence. I let Mrs. Fairfax precede me into the dining-room, and kept
in her shade as we crossed that apartment; and, passing the arch, whose
curtain was now dropped, entered the elegant recess beyond.

Two wax candles stood lighted on the table, and two on the mantelpiece;
basking in the light and heat of a superb fire, lay Pilot—Adèle knelt
near him. Half reclined on a couch appeared Mr. Rochester, his foot
supported by the cushion; he was looking at Adèle and the dog: the fire
shone full on his face. I knew my traveller with his broad and jetty
eyebrows; his square forehead, made squarer by the horizontal sweep of
his black hair. I recognised his decisive nose, more remarkable for
character than beauty; his full nostrils, denoting, I thought, choler;
his grim mouth, chin, and jaw—yes, all three were very grim, and no
mistake. His shape, now divested of cloak, I perceived harmonised in
squareness with his physiognomy: I suppose it was a good figure in the
athletic sense of the term—broad chested and thin flanked, though
neither tall nor graceful.

Mr. Rochester must have been aware of the entrance of Mrs. Fairfax and
myself; but it appeared he was not in the mood to notice us, for he
never lifted his head as we approached.

“Here is Miss Eyre, sir,” said Mrs. Fairfax, in her quiet way. He
bowed, still not taking his eyes from the group of the dog and child.

“Let Miss Eyre be seated,” said he: and there was something in the
forced stiff bow, in the impatient yet formal tone, which seemed
further to express, “What the deuce is it to me whether Miss Eyre be
there or not? At this moment I am not disposed to accost her.”

I sat down quite disembarrassed. A reception of finished politeness
would probably have confused me: I could not have returned or repaid it
by answering grace and elegance on my part; but harsh caprice laid me
under no obligation; on the contrary, a decent quiescence, under the
freak of manner, gave me the advantage. Besides, the eccentricity of
the proceeding was piquant: I felt interested to see how he would go
on.

He went on as a statue would, that is, he neither spoke nor moved. Mrs.
Fairfax seemed to think it necessary that some one should be amiable,
and she began to talk. Kindly, as usual—and, as usual, rather trite—she
condoled with him on the pressure of business he had had all day; on
the annoyance it must have been to him with that painful sprain: then
she commended his patience and perseverance in going through with it.

“Madam, I should like some tea,” was the sole rejoinder she got. She
hastened to ring the bell; and when the tray came, she proceeded to
arrange the cups, spoons, &c., with assiduous celerity. I and Adèle
went to the table; but the master did not leave his couch.

“Will you hand Mr. Rochester’s cup?” said Mrs. Fairfax to me; “Adèle
might perhaps spill it.”

I did as requested. As he took the cup from my hand, Adèle, thinking
the moment propitious for making a request in my favour, cried out—

“N’est-ce pas, monsieur, qu’il y a un cadeau pour Mademoiselle Eyre
dans votre petit coffre?”

“Who talks of cadeaux?” said he gruffly. “Did you expect a present,
Miss Eyre? Are you fond of presents?” and he searched my face with eyes
that I saw were dark, irate, and piercing.

“I hardly know, sir; I have little experience of them: they are
generally thought pleasant things.”

“Generally thought? But what do _you_ think?”

“I should be obliged to take time, sir, before I could give you an
answer worthy of your acceptance: a present has many faces to it, has
it not? and one should consider all, before pronouncing an opinion as
to its nature.”

“Miss Eyre, you are not so unsophisticated as Adèle: she demands a
‘cadeau,’ clamorously, the moment she sees me: you beat about the
bush.”

“Because I have less confidence in my deserts than Adèle has: she can
prefer the claim of old acquaintance, and the right too of custom; for
she says you have always been in the habit of giving her playthings;
but if I had to make out a case I should be puzzled, since I am a
stranger, and have done nothing to entitle me to an acknowledgment.”

“Oh, don’t fall back on over-modesty! I have examined Adèle, and find
you have taken great pains with her: she is not bright, she has no
talents; yet in a short time she has made much improvement.”

“Sir, you have now given me my ‘cadeau;’ I am obliged to you: it is the
meed teachers most covet—praise of their pupils’ progress.”

“Humph!” said Mr. Rochester, and he took his tea in silence.

“Come to the fire,” said the master, when the tray was taken away, and
Mrs. Fairfax had settled into a corner with her knitting; while Adèle
was leading me by the hand round the room, showing me the beautiful
books and ornaments on the consoles and chiffonnières. We obeyed, as in
duty bound; Adèle wanted to take a seat on my knee, but she was ordered
to amuse herself with Pilot.

“You have been resident in my house three months?”

“Yes, sir.”

“And you came from—?”

“From Lowood school, in ——shire.”

“Ah! a charitable concern. How long were you there?”

“Eight years.”

“Eight years! you must be tenacious of life. I thought half the time in
such a place would have done up any constitution! No wonder you have
rather the look of another world. I marvelled where you had got that
sort of face. When you came on me in Hay Lane last night, I thought
unaccountably of fairy tales, and had half a mind to demand whether you
had bewitched my horse: I am not sure yet. Who are your parents?”

“I have none.”

“Nor ever had, I suppose: do you remember them?”

“No.”

“I thought not. And so you were waiting for your people when you sat on
that stile?”

“For whom, sir?”

“For the men in green: it was a proper moonlight evening for them. Did
I break through one of your rings, that you spread that damned ice on
the causeway?”

I shook my head. “The men in green all forsook England a hundred years
ago,” said I, speaking as seriously as he had done. “And not even in
Hay Lane, or the fields about it, could you find a trace of them. I
don’t think either summer or harvest, or winter moon, will ever shine
on their revels more.”

Mrs. Fairfax had dropped her knitting, and, with raised eyebrows,
seemed wondering what sort of talk this was.

“Well,” resumed Mr. Rochester, “if you disown parents, you must have
some sort of kinsfolk: uncles and aunts?”

“No; none that I ever saw.”

“And your home?”

“I have none.”

“Where do your brothers and sisters live?”

“I have no brothers or sisters.”

“Who recommended you to come here?”

“I advertised, and Mrs. Fairfax answered my advertisement.”

“Yes,” said the good lady, who now knew what ground we were upon, “and
I am daily thankful for the choice Providence led me to make. Miss Eyre
has been an invaluable companion to me, and a kind and careful teacher
to Adèle.”

“Don’t trouble yourself to give her a character,” returned Mr.
Rochester: “eulogiums will not bias me; I shall judge for myself. She
began by felling my horse.”

“Sir?” said Mrs. Fairfax.

“I have to thank her for this sprain.”

The widow looked bewildered.

“Miss Eyre, have you ever lived in a town?”

“No, sir.”

“Have you seen much society?”

“None but the pupils and teachers of Lowood, and now the inmates of
Thornfield.”

“Have you read much?”

“Only such books as came in my way; and they have not been numerous or
very learned.”

“You have lived the life of a nun: no doubt you are well drilled in
religious forms;—Brocklehurst, who I understand directs Lowood, is a
parson, is he not?”

“Yes, sir.”

“And you girls probably worshipped him, as a convent full of
religieuses would worship their director.”

“Oh, no.”

“You are very cool! No! What! a novice not worship her priest! That
sounds blasphemous.”

“I disliked Mr. Brocklehurst; and I was not alone in the feeling. He is
a harsh man; at once pompous and meddling; he cut off our hair; and for
economy’s sake bought us bad needles and thread, with which we could
hardly sew.”

“That was very false economy,” remarked Mrs. Fairfax, who now again
caught the drift of the dialogue.

“And was that the head and front of his offending?” demanded Mr.
Rochester.

“He starved us when he had the sole superintendence of the provision
department, before the committee was appointed; and he bored us with
long lectures once a week, and with evening readings from books of his
own inditing, about sudden deaths and judgments, which made us afraid
to go to bed.”

“What age were you when you went to Lowood?”

“About ten.”

“And you stayed there eight years: you are now, then, eighteen?”

I assented.

“Arithmetic, you see, is useful; without its aid, I should hardly have
been able to guess your age. It is a point difficult to fix where the
features and countenance are so much at variance as in your case. And
now what did you learn at Lowood? Can you play?”

“A little.”

“Of course: that is the established answer. Go into the library—I mean,
if you please.—(Excuse my tone of command; I am used to say, ‘Do this,’
and it is done: I cannot alter my customary habits for one new
inmate.)—Go, then, into the library; take a candle with you; leave the
door open; sit down to the piano, and play a tune.”

I departed, obeying his directions.

“Enough!” he called out in a few minutes. “You play _a little_, I see;
like any other English school-girl; perhaps rather better than some,
but not well.”

I closed the piano and returned. Mr. Rochester continued—

“Adèle showed me some sketches this morning, which she said were yours.
I don’t know whether they were entirely of your doing; probably a
master aided you?”

“No, indeed!” I interjected.

“Ah! that pricks pride. Well, fetch me your portfolio, if you can vouch
for its contents being original; but don’t pass your word unless you
are certain: I can recognise patchwork.”

“Then I will say nothing, and you shall judge for yourself, sir.”

I brought the portfolio from the library.

“Approach the table,” said he; and I wheeled it to his couch. Adèle and
Mrs. Fairfax drew near to see the pictures.

“No crowding,” said Mr. Rochester: “take the drawings from my hand as I
finish with them; but don’t push your faces up to mine.”

He deliberately scrutinised each sketch and painting. Three he laid
aside; the others, when he had examined them, he swept from him.

“Take them off to the other table, Mrs. Fairfax,” said he, “and look at
them with Adèle;—you” (glancing at me) “resume your seat, and answer my
questions. I perceive those pictures were done by one hand: was that
hand yours?”

“Yes.”

“And when did you find time to do them? They have taken much time, and
some thought.”

“I did them in the last two vacations I spent at Lowood, when I had no
other occupation.”

“Where did you get your copies?”

“Out of my head.”

“That head I see now on your shoulders?”

“Yes, sir.”

“Has it other furniture of the same kind within?”

“I should think it may have: I should hope—better.”

He spread the pictures before him, and again surveyed them alternately.

While he is so occupied, I will tell you, reader, what they are: and
first, I must premise that they are nothing wonderful. The subjects
had, indeed, risen vividly on my mind. As I saw them with the spiritual
eye, before I attempted to embody them, they were striking; but my hand
would not second my fancy, and in each case it had wrought out but a
pale portrait of the thing I had conceived.

These pictures were in water-colours. The first represented clouds low
and livid, rolling over a swollen sea: all the distance was in eclipse;
so, too, was the foreground; or rather, the nearest billows, for there
was no land. One gleam of light lifted into relief a half-submerged
mast, on which sat a cormorant, dark and large, with wings flecked with
foam; its beak held a gold bracelet set with gems, that I had touched
with as brilliant tints as my palette could yield, and as glittering
distinctness as my pencil could impart. Sinking below the bird and
mast, a drowned corpse glanced through the green water; a fair arm was
the only limb clearly visible, whence the bracelet had been washed or
torn.

The second picture contained for foreground only the dim peak of a
hill, with grass and some leaves slanting as if by a breeze. Beyond and
above spread an expanse of sky, dark blue as at twilight: rising into
the sky was a woman’s shape to the bust, portrayed in tints as dusk and
soft as I could combine. The dim forehead was crowned with a star; the
lineaments below were seen as through the suffusion of vapour; the eyes
shone dark and wild; the hair streamed shadowy, like a beamless cloud
torn by storm or by electric travail. On the neck lay a pale reflection
like moonlight; the same faint lustre touched the train of thin clouds
from which rose and bowed this vision of the Evening Star.

The third showed the pinnacle of an iceberg piercing a polar winter
sky: a muster of northern lights reared their dim lances, close
serried, along the horizon. Throwing these into distance, rose, in the
foreground, a head,—a colossal head, inclined towards the iceberg, and
resting against it. Two thin hands, joined under the forehead, and
supporting it, drew up before the lower features a sable veil; a brow
quite bloodless, white as bone, and an eye hollow and fixed, blank of
meaning but for the glassiness of despair, alone were visible. Above
the temples, amidst wreathed turban folds of black drapery, vague in
its character and consistency as cloud, gleamed a ring of white flame,
gemmed with sparkles of a more lurid tinge. This pale crescent was “the
likeness of a kingly crown;” what it diademed was “the shape which
shape had none.”

“Were you happy when you painted these pictures?” asked Mr. Rochester
presently.

“I was absorbed, sir: yes, and I was happy. To paint them, in short,
was to enjoy one of the keenest pleasures I have ever known.”

“That is not saying much. Your pleasures, by your own account, have
been few; but I daresay you did exist in a kind of artist’s dreamland
while you blent and arranged these strange tints. Did you sit at them
long each day?”

“I had nothing else to do, because it was the vacation, and I sat at
them from morning till noon, and from noon till night: the length of
the midsummer days favoured my inclination to apply.”

“And you felt self-satisfied with the result of your ardent labours?”

“Far from it. I was tormented by the contrast between my idea and my
handiwork: in each case I had imagined something which I was quite
powerless to realise.”

“Not quite: you have secured the shadow of your thought; but no more,
probably. You had not enough of the artist’s skill and science to give
it full being: yet the drawings are, for a school-girl, peculiar. As to
the thoughts, they are elfish. These eyes in the Evening Star you must
have seen in a dream. How could you make them look so clear, and yet
not at all brilliant? for the planet above quells their rays. And what
meaning is that in their solemn depth? And who taught you to paint
wind? There is a high gale in that sky, and on this hill-top. Where did
you see Latmos? For that is Latmos. There! put the drawings away!”

I had scarce tied the strings of the portfolio, when, looking at his
watch, he said abruptly—

“It is nine o’clock: what are you about, Miss Eyre, to let Adèle sit up
so long? Take her to bed.”

Adèle went to kiss him before quitting the room: he endured the caress,
but scarcely seemed to relish it more than Pilot would have done, nor
so much.

“I wish you all good-night, now,” said he, making a movement of the
hand towards the door, in token that he was tired of our company, and
wished to dismiss us. Mrs. Fairfax folded up her knitting: I took my
portfolio: we curtseyed to him, received a frigid bow in return, and so
withdrew.

“You said Mr. Rochester was not strikingly peculiar, Mrs. Fairfax,” I
observed, when I rejoined her in her room, after putting Adèle to bed.

“Well, is he?”

“I think so: he is very changeful and abrupt.”

“True: no doubt he may appear so to a stranger, but I am so accustomed
to his manner, I never think of it; and then, if he has peculiarities
of temper, allowance should be made.”

“Why?”

“Partly because it is his nature—and we can none of us help our nature;
and partly because he has painful thoughts, no doubt, to harass him,
and make his spirits unequal.”

“What about?”

“Family troubles, for one thing.”

“But he has no family.”

“Not now, but he has had—or, at least, relatives. He lost his elder
brother a few years since.”

“His _elder_ brother?”

“Yes. The present Mr. Rochester has not been very long in possession of
the property; only about nine years.”

“Nine years is a tolerable time. Was he so very fond of his brother as
to be still inconsolable for his loss?”

“Why, no—perhaps not. I believe there were some misunderstandings
between them. Mr. Rowland Rochester was not quite just to Mr. Edward;
and perhaps he prejudiced his father against him. The old gentleman was
fond of money, and anxious to keep the family estate together. He did
not like to diminish the property by division, and yet he was anxious
that Mr. Edward should have wealth, too, to keep up the consequence of
the name; and, soon after he was of age, some steps were taken that
were not quite fair, and made a great deal of mischief. Old Mr.
Rochester and Mr. Rowland combined to bring Mr. Edward into what he
considered a painful position, for the sake of making his fortune: what
the precise nature of that position was I never clearly knew, but his
spirit could not brook what he had to suffer in it. He is not very
forgiving: he broke with his family, and now for many years he has led
an unsettled kind of life. I don’t think he has ever been resident at
Thornfield for a fortnight together, since the death of his brother
without a will left him master of the estate; and, indeed, no wonder he
shuns the old place.”

“Why should he shun it?”

“Perhaps he thinks it gloomy.”

The answer was evasive. I should have liked something clearer; but Mrs.
Fairfax either could not, or would not, give me more explicit
information of the origin and nature of Mr. Rochester’s trials. She
averred they were a mystery to herself, and that what she knew was
chiefly from conjecture. It was evident, indeed, that she wished me to
drop the subject, which I did accordingly.




CHAPTER XIV


For several subsequent days I saw little of Mr. Rochester. In the
mornings he seemed much engaged with business, and, in the afternoon,
gentlemen from Millcote or the neighbourhood called, and sometimes
stayed to dine with him. When his sprain was well enough to admit of
horse exercise, he rode out a good deal; probably to return these
visits, as he generally did not come back till late at night.

During this interval, even Adèle was seldom sent for to his presence,
and all my acquaintance with him was confined to an occasional
rencontre in the hall, on the stairs, or in the gallery, when he would
sometimes pass me haughtily and coldly, just acknowledging my presence
by a distant nod or a cool glance, and sometimes bow and smile with
gentlemanlike affability. His changes of mood did not offend me,
because I saw that I had nothing to do with their alternation; the ebb
and flow depended on causes quite disconnected with me.

One day he had had company to dinner, and had sent for my portfolio; in
order, doubtless, to exhibit its contents: the gentlemen went away
early, to attend a public meeting at Millcote, as Mrs. Fairfax informed
me; but the night being wet and inclement, Mr. Rochester did not
accompany them. Soon after they were gone he rang the bell: a message
came that I and Adèle were to go downstairs. I brushed Adèle’s hair and
made her neat, and having ascertained that I was myself in my usual
Quaker trim, where there was nothing to retouch—all being too close and
plain, braided locks included, to admit of disarrangement—we descended,
Adèle wondering whether the _petit coffre_ was at length come; for,
owing to some mistake, its arrival had hitherto been delayed. She was
gratified: there it stood, a little carton, on the table when we
entered the dining-room. She appeared to know it by instinct.

“Ma boite! ma boite!” exclaimed she, running towards it.

“Yes, there is your ‘boite’ at last: take it into a corner, you genuine
daughter of Paris, and amuse yourself with disembowelling it,” said the
deep and rather sarcastic voice of Mr. Rochester, proceeding from the
depths of an immense easy-chair at the fireside. “And mind,” he
continued, “don’t bother me with any details of the anatomical process,
or any notice of the condition of the entrails: let your operation be
conducted in silence: tiens-toi tranquille, enfant; comprends-tu?”

Adèle seemed scarcely to need the warning; she had already retired to a
sofa with her treasure, and was busy untying the cord which secured the
lid. Having removed this impediment, and lifted certain silvery
envelopes of tissue paper, she merely exclaimed—

“Oh ciel! Que c’est beau!” and then remained absorbed in ecstatic
contemplation.

“Is Miss Eyre there?” now demanded the master, half rising from his
seat to look round to the door, near which I still stood.

“Ah! well, come forward; be seated here.” He drew a chair near his own.
“I am not fond of the prattle of children,” he continued; “for, old
bachelor as I am, I have no pleasant associations connected with their
lisp. It would be intolerable to me to pass a whole evening
_tête-à-tête_ with a brat. Don’t draw that chair farther off, Miss
Eyre; sit down exactly where I placed it—if you please, that is.
Confound these civilities! I continually forget them. Nor do I
particularly affect simple-minded old ladies. By-the-bye, I must have
mine in mind; it won’t do to neglect her; she is a Fairfax, or wed to
one; and blood is said to be thicker than water.”

He rang, and despatched an invitation to Mrs. Fairfax, who soon
arrived, knitting-basket in hand.

“Good evening, madam; I sent to you for a charitable purpose. I have
forbidden Adèle to talk to me about her presents, and she is bursting
with repletion; have the goodness to serve her as auditress and
interlocutrice; it will be one of the most benevolent acts you ever
performed.”

Adèle, indeed, no sooner saw Mrs. Fairfax, than she summoned her to her
sofa, and there quickly filled her lap with the porcelain, the ivory,
the waxen contents of her “boite;” pouring out, meantime, explanations
and raptures in such broken English as she was mistress of.

“Now I have performed the part of a good host,” pursued Mr. Rochester,
“put my guests into the way of amusing each other, I ought to be at
liberty to attend to my own pleasure. Miss Eyre, draw your chair still
a little farther forward: you are yet too far back; I cannot see you
without disturbing my position in this comfortable chair, which I have
no mind to do.”

I did as I was bid, though I would much rather have remained somewhat
in the shade; but Mr. Rochester had such a direct way of giving orders,
it seemed a matter of course to obey him promptly.

We were, as I have said, in the dining-room: the lustre, which had been
lit for dinner, filled the room with a festal breadth of light; the
large fire was all red and clear; the purple curtains hung rich and
ample before the lofty window and loftier arch; everything was still,
save the subdued chat of Adèle (she dared not speak loud), and, filling
up each pause, the beating of winter rain against the panes.

Mr. Rochester, as he sat in his damask-covered chair, looked different
to what I had seen him look before; not quite so stern—much less
gloomy. There was a smile on his lips, and his eyes sparkled, whether
with wine or not, I am not sure; but I think it very probable. He was,
in short, in his after-dinner mood; more expanded and genial, and also
more self-indulgent than the frigid and rigid temper of the morning;
still he looked preciously grim, cushioning his massive head against
the swelling back of his chair, and receiving the light of the fire on
his granite-hewn features, and in his great, dark eyes; for he had
great, dark eyes, and very fine eyes, too—not without a certain change
in their depths sometimes, which, if it was not softness, reminded you,
at least, of that feeling.

He had been looking two minutes at the fire, and I had been looking the
same length of time at him, when, turning suddenly, he caught my gaze
fastened on his physiognomy.

“You examine me, Miss Eyre,” said he: “do you think me handsome?”

I should, if I had deliberated, have replied to this question by
something conventionally vague and polite; but the answer somehow
slipped from my tongue before I was aware—“No, sir.”

“Ah! By my word! there is something singular about you,” said he: “you
have the air of a little _nonnette_; quaint, quiet, grave, and simple,
as you sit with your hands before you, and your eyes generally bent on
the carpet (except, by-the-bye, when they are directed piercingly to my
face; as just now, for instance); and when one asks you a question, or
makes a remark to which you are obliged to reply, you rap out a round
rejoinder, which, if not blunt, is at least brusque. What do you mean
by it?”

“Sir, I was too plain; I beg your pardon. I ought to have replied that
it was not easy to give an impromptu answer to a question about
appearances; that tastes mostly differ; and that beauty is of little
consequence, or something of that sort.”

“You ought to have replied no such thing. Beauty of little consequence,
indeed! And so, under pretence of softening the previous outrage, of
stroking and soothing me into placidity, you stick a sly penknife under
my ear! Go on: what fault do you find with me, pray? I suppose I have
all my limbs and all my features like any other man?”

“Mr. Rochester, allow me to disown my first answer: I intended no
pointed repartee: it was only a blunder.”

“Just so: I think so: and you shall be answerable for it. Criticise me:
does my forehead not please you?”

He lifted up the sable waves of hair which lay horizontally over his
brow, and showed a solid enough mass of intellectual organs, but an
abrupt deficiency where the suave sign of benevolence should have
risen.

“Now, ma’am, am I a fool?”

“Far from it, sir. You would, perhaps, think me rude if I inquired in
return whether you are a philanthropist?”

“There again! Another stick of the penknife, when she pretended to pat
my head: and that is because I said I did not like the society of
children and old women (low be it spoken!). No, young lady, I am not a
general philanthropist; but I bear a conscience;” and he pointed to the
prominences which are said to indicate that faculty, and which,
fortunately for him, were sufficiently conspicuous; giving, indeed, a
marked breadth to the upper part of his head: “and, besides, I once had
a kind of rude tenderness of heart. When I was as old as you, I was a
feeling fellow enough; partial to the unfledged, unfostered, and
unlucky; but Fortune has knocked me about since: she has even kneaded
me with her knuckles, and now I flatter myself I am hard and tough as
an India-rubber ball; pervious, though, through a chink or two still,
and with one sentient point in the middle of the lump. Yes: does that
leave hope for me?”

“Hope of what, sir?”

“Of my final re-transformation from India-rubber back to flesh?”

“Decidedly he has had too much wine,” I thought; and I did not know
what answer to make to his queer question: how could I tell whether he
was capable of being re-transformed?

“You looked very much puzzled, Miss Eyre; and though you are not pretty
any more than I am handsome, yet a puzzled air becomes you; besides, it
is convenient, for it keeps those searching eyes of yours away from my
physiognomy, and busies them with the worsted flowers of the rug; so
puzzle on. Young lady, I am disposed to be gregarious and communicative
to-night.”

With this announcement he rose from his chair, and stood, leaning his
arm on the marble mantelpiece: in that attitude his shape was seen
plainly as well as his face; his unusual breadth of chest,
disproportionate almost to his length of limb. I am sure most people
would have thought him an ugly man; yet there was so much unconscious
pride in his port; so much ease in his demeanour; such a look of
complete indifference to his own external appearance; so haughty a
reliance on the power of other qualities, intrinsic or adventitious, to
atone for the lack of mere personal attractiveness, that, in looking at
him, one inevitably shared the indifference, and, even in a blind,
imperfect sense, put faith in the confidence.

“I am disposed to be gregarious and communicative to-night,” he
repeated, “and that is why I sent for you: the fire and the chandelier
were not sufficient company for me; nor would Pilot have been, for none
of these can talk. Adèle is a degree better, but still far below the
mark; Mrs. Fairfax ditto; you, I am persuaded, can suit me if you will:
you puzzled me the first evening I invited you down here. I have almost
forgotten you since: other ideas have driven yours from my head; but
to-night I am resolved to be at ease; to dismiss what importunes, and
recall what pleases. It would please me now to draw you out—to learn
more of you—therefore speak.”

Instead of speaking, I smiled; and not a very complacent or submissive
smile either.

“Speak,” he urged.

“What about, sir?”

“Whatever you like. I leave both the choice of subject and the manner
of treating it entirely to yourself.”

Accordingly I sat and said nothing: “If he expects me to talk for the
mere sake of talking and showing off, he will find he has addressed
himself to the wrong person,” I thought.

“You are dumb, Miss Eyre.”

I was dumb still. He bent his head a little towards me, and with a
single hasty glance seemed to dive into my eyes.

“Stubborn?” he said, “and annoyed. Ah! it is consistent. I put my
request in an absurd, almost insolent form. Miss Eyre, I beg your
pardon. The fact is, once for all, I don’t wish to treat you like an
inferior: that is” (correcting himself), “I claim only such superiority
as must result from twenty years’ difference in age and a century’s
advance in experience. This is legitimate, _et j’y tiens_, as Adèle
would say; and it is by virtue of this superiority, and this alone,
that I desire you to have the goodness to talk to me a little now, and
divert my thoughts, which are galled with dwelling on one
point—cankering as a rusty nail.”

He had deigned an explanation, almost an apology, and I did not feel
insensible to his condescension, and would not seem so.

“I am willing to amuse you, if I can, sir—quite willing; but I cannot
introduce a topic, because how do I know what will interest you? Ask me
questions, and I will do my best to answer them.”

“Then, in the first place, do you agree with me that I have a right to
be a little masterful, abrupt, perhaps exacting, sometimes, on the
grounds I stated, namely, that I am old enough to be your father, and
that I have battled through a varied experience with many men of many
nations, and roamed over half the globe, while you have lived quietly
with one set of people in one house?”

“Do as you please, sir.”

“That is no answer; or rather it is a very irritating, because a very
evasive one. Reply clearly.”

“I don’t think, sir, you have a right to command me, merely because you
are older than I, or because you have seen more of the world than I
have; your claim to superiority depends on the use you have made of
your time and experience.”

“Humph! Promptly spoken. But I won’t allow that, seeing that it would
never suit my case, as I have made an indifferent, not to say a bad,
use of both advantages. Leaving superiority out of the question, then,
you must still agree to receive my orders now and then, without being
piqued or hurt by the tone of command. Will you?”

I smiled: I thought to myself Mr. Rochester _is_ peculiar—he seems to
forget that he pays me £30 per annum for receiving his orders.

“The smile is very well,” said he, catching instantly the passing
expression; “but speak too.”

“I was thinking, sir, that very few masters would trouble themselves to
inquire whether or not their paid subordinates were piqued and hurt by
their orders.”

“Paid subordinates! What! you are my paid subordinate, are you? Oh yes,
I had forgotten the salary! Well then, on that mercenary ground, will
you agree to let me hector a little?”

“No, sir, not on that ground; but, on the ground that you did forget
it, and that you care whether or not a dependent is comfortable in his
dependency, I agree heartily.”

“And will you consent to dispense with a great many conventional forms
and phrases, without thinking that the omission arises from insolence?”

“I am sure, sir, I should never mistake informality for insolence: one
I rather like, the other nothing free-born would submit to, even for a
salary.”

“Humbug! Most things free-born will submit to anything for a salary;
therefore, keep to yourself, and don’t venture on generalities of which
you are intensely ignorant. However, I mentally shake hands with you
for your answer, despite its inaccuracy; and as much for the manner in
which it was said, as for the substance of the speech; the manner was
frank and sincere; one does not often see such a manner: no, on the
contrary, affectation, or coldness, or stupid, coarse-minded
misapprehension of one’s meaning are the usual rewards of candour. Not
three in three thousand raw school-girl-governesses would have answered
me as you have just done. But I don’t mean to flatter you: if you are
cast in a different mould to the majority, it is no merit of yours:
Nature did it. And then, after all, I go too fast in my conclusions:
for what I yet know, you may be no better than the rest; you may have
intolerable defects to counterbalance your few good points.”

“And so may you,” I thought. My eye met his as the idea crossed my
mind: he seemed to read the glance, answering as if its import had been
spoken as well as imagined—

“Yes, yes, you are right,” said he; “I have plenty of faults of my own:
I know it, and I don’t wish to palliate them, I assure you. God wot I
need not be too severe about others; I have a past existence, a series
of deeds, a colour of life to contemplate within my own breast, which
might well call my sneers and censures from my neighbours to myself. I
started, or rather (for like other defaulters, I like to lay half the
blame on ill fortune and adverse circumstances) was thrust on to a
wrong tack at the age of one-and-twenty, and have never recovered the
right course since: but I might have been very different; I might have
been as good as you—wiser—almost as stainless. I envy you your peace of
mind, your clean conscience, your unpolluted memory. Little girl, a
memory without blot or contamination must be an exquisite treasure—an
inexhaustible source of pure refreshment: is it not?”

“How was your memory when you were eighteen, sir?”

“All right then; limpid, salubrious: no gush of bilge water had turned
it to fetid puddle. I was your equal at eighteen—quite your equal.
Nature meant me to be, on the whole, a good man, Miss Eyre; one of the
better kind, and you see I am not so. You would say you don’t see it;
at least I flatter myself I read as much in your eye (beware,
by-the-bye, what you express with that organ; I am quick at
interpreting its language). Then take my word for it,—I am not a
villain: you are not to suppose that—not to attribute to me any such
bad eminence; but, owing, I verily believe, rather to circumstances
than to my natural bent, I am a trite commonplace sinner, hackneyed in
all the poor petty dissipations with which the rich and worthless try
to put on life. Do you wonder that I avow this to you? Know, that in
the course of your future life you will often find yourself elected the
involuntary confidant of your acquaintances’ secrets: people will
instinctively find out, as I have done, that it is not your forte to
tell of yourself, but to listen while others talk of themselves; they
will feel, too, that you listen with no malevolent scorn of their
indiscretion, but with a kind of innate sympathy; not the less
comforting and encouraging because it is very unobtrusive in its
manifestations.”

“How do you know?—how can you guess all this, sir?”

“I know it well; therefore I proceed almost as freely as if I were
writing my thoughts in a diary. You would say, I should have been
superior to circumstances; so I should—so I should; but you see I was
not. When fate wronged me, I had not the wisdom to remain cool: I
turned desperate; then I degenerated. Now, when any vicious simpleton
excites my disgust by his paltry ribaldry, I cannot flatter myself that
I am better than he: I am forced to confess that he and I are on a
level. I wish I had stood firm—God knows I do! Dread remorse when you
are tempted to err, Miss Eyre; remorse is the poison of life.”

“Repentance is said to be its cure, sir.”

“It is not its cure. Reformation may be its cure; and I could reform—I
have strength yet for that—if—but where is the use of thinking of it,
hampered, burdened, cursed as I am? Besides, since happiness is
irrevocably denied me, I have a right to get pleasure out of life: and
I _will_ get it, cost what it may.”

“Then you will degenerate still more, sir.”

“Possibly: yet why should I, if I can get sweet, fresh pleasure? And I
may get it as sweet and fresh as the wild honey the bee gathers on the
moor.”

“It will sting—it will taste bitter, sir.”

“How do you know?—you never tried it. How very serious—how very solemn
you look: and you are as ignorant of the matter as this cameo head”
(taking one from the mantelpiece). “You have no right to preach to me,
you neophyte, that have not passed the porch of life, and are
absolutely unacquainted with its mysteries.”

“I only remind you of your own words, sir: you said error brought
remorse, and you pronounced remorse the poison of existence.”

“And who talks of error now? I scarcely think the notion that flittered
across my brain was an error. I believe it was an inspiration rather
than a temptation: it was very genial, very soothing—I know that. Here
it comes again! It is no devil, I assure you; or if it be, it has put
on the robes of an angel of light. I think I must admit so fair a guest
when it asks entrance to my heart.”

“Distrust it, sir; it is not a true angel.”

“Once more, how do you know? By what instinct do you pretend to
distinguish between a fallen seraph of the abyss and a messenger from
the eternal throne—between a guide and a seducer?”

“I judged by your countenance, sir, which was troubled when you said
the suggestion had returned upon you. I feel sure it will work you more
misery if you listen to it.”

“Not at all—it bears the most gracious message in the world: for the
rest, you are not my conscience-keeper, so don’t make yourself uneasy.
Here, come in, bonny wanderer!”

He said this as if he spoke to a vision, viewless to any eye but his
own; then, folding his arms, which he had half extended, on his chest,
he seemed to enclose in their embrace the invisible being.

“Now,” he continued, again addressing me, “I have received the
pilgrim—a disguised deity, as I verily believe. Already it has done me
good: my heart was a sort of charnel; it will now be a shrine.”

“To speak truth, sir, I don’t understand you at all: I cannot keep up
the conversation, because it has got out of my depth. Only one thing, I
know: you said you were not as good as you should like to be, and that
you regretted your own imperfection;—one thing I can comprehend: you
intimated that to have a sullied memory was a perpetual bane. It seems
to me, that if you tried hard, you would in time find it possible to
become what you yourself would approve; and that if from this day you
began with resolution to correct your thoughts and actions, you would
in a few years have laid up a new and stainless store of recollections,
to which you might revert with pleasure.”

“Justly thought; rightly said, Miss Eyre; and, at this moment, I am
paving hell with energy.”

“Sir?”

“I am laying down good intentions, which I believe durable as flint.
Certainly, my associates and pursuits shall be other than they have
been.”

“And better?”

“And better—so much better as pure ore is than foul dross. You seem to
doubt me; I don’t doubt myself: I know what my aim is, what my motives
are; and at this moment I pass a law, unalterable as that of the Medes
and Persians, that both are right.”

“They cannot be, sir, if they require a new statute to legalise them.”

“They are, Miss Eyre, though they absolutely require a new statute:
unheard-of combinations of circumstances demand unheard-of rules.”

“That sounds a dangerous maxim, sir; because one can see at once that
it is liable to abuse.”

“Sententious sage! so it is: but I swear by my household gods not to
abuse it.”

“You are human and fallible.”

“I am: so are you—what then?”

“The human and fallible should not arrogate a power with which the
divine and perfect alone can be safely intrusted.”

“What power?”

“That of saying of any strange, unsanctioned line of action,—‘Let it be
right.’”

“‘Let it be right’—the very words: you have pronounced them.”

“_May_ it be right then,” I said, as I rose, deeming it useless to
continue a discourse which was all darkness to me; and, besides,
sensible that the character of my interlocutor was beyond my
penetration; at least, beyond its present reach; and feeling the
uncertainty, the vague sense of insecurity, which accompanies a
conviction of ignorance.

“Where are you going?”

“To put Adèle to bed: it is past her bedtime.”

“You are afraid of me, because I talk like a Sphynx.”

“Your language is enigmatical, sir: but though I am bewildered, I am
certainly not afraid.”

“You _are_ afraid—your self-love dreads a blunder.”

“In that sense I do feel apprehensive—I have no wish to talk nonsense.”

“If you did, it would be in such a grave, quiet manner, I should
mistake it for sense. Do you never laugh, Miss Eyre? Don’t trouble
yourself to answer—I see you laugh rarely; but you can laugh very
merrily: believe me, you are not naturally austere, any more than I am
naturally vicious. The Lowood constraint still clings to you somewhat;
controlling your features, muffling your voice, and restricting your
limbs; and you fear in the presence of a man and a brother—or father,
or master, or what you will—to smile too gaily, speak too freely, or
move too quickly: but, in time, I think you will learn to be natural
with me, as I find it impossible to be conventional with you; and then
your looks and movements will have more vivacity and variety than they
dare offer now. I see at intervals the glance of a curious sort of bird
through the close-set bars of a cage: a vivid, restless, resolute
captive is there; were it but free, it would soar cloud-high. You are
still bent on going?”

“It has struck nine, sir.”

“Never mind,—wait a minute: Adèle is not ready to go to bed yet. My
position, Miss Eyre, with my back to the fire, and my face to the room,
favours observation. While talking to you, I have also occasionally
watched Adèle (I have my own reasons for thinking her a curious
study,—reasons that I may, nay, that I shall, impart to you some day).
She pulled out of her box, about ten minutes ago, a little pink silk
frock; rapture lit her face as she unfolded it; coquetry runs in her
blood, blends with her brains, and seasons the marrow of her bones. ‘Il
faut que je l’essaie!’ cried she, ‘et à l’instant même!’ and she rushed
out of the room. She is now with Sophie, undergoing a robing process:
in a few minutes she will re-enter; and I know what I shall see,—a
miniature of Céline Varens, as she used to appear on the boards at the
rising of—But never mind that. However, my tenderest feelings are about
to receive a shock: such is my presentiment; stay now, to see whether
it will be realised.”

Ere long, Adèle’s little foot was heard tripping across the hall. She
entered, transformed as her guardian had predicted. A dress of
rose-coloured satin, very short, and as full in the skirt as it could
be gathered, replaced the brown frock she had previously worn; a wreath
of rosebuds circled her forehead; her feet were dressed in silk
stockings and small white satin sandals.

“Est-ce que ma robe va bien?” cried she, bounding forwards; “et mes
souliers? et mes bas? Tenez, je crois que je vais danser!”

And spreading out her dress, she chasséed across the room till, having
reached Mr. Rochester, she wheeled lightly round before him on tip-toe,
then dropped on one knee at his feet, exclaiming—

“Monsieur, je vous remercie mille fois de votre bonté;” then rising,
she added, “C’est comme cela que maman faisait, n’est-ce pas,
monsieur?”

“Pre-cise-ly!” was the answer; “and, ‘comme cela,’ she charmed my
English gold out of my British breeches’ pocket. I have been green,
too, Miss Eyre,—ay, grass green: not a more vernal tint freshens you
now than once freshened me. My Spring is gone, however, but it has left
me that French floweret on my hands, which, in some moods, I would fain
be rid of. Not valuing now the root whence it sprang; having found that
it was of a sort which nothing but gold dust could manure, I have but
half a liking to the blossom, especially when it looks so artificial as
just now. I keep it and rear it rather on the Roman Catholic principle
of expiating numerous sins, great or small, by one good work. I’ll
explain all this some day. Good-night.”




CHAPTER XV


Mr. Rochester did, on a future occasion, explain it. It was one
afternoon, when he chanced to meet me and Adèle in the grounds: and
while she played with Pilot and her shuttlecock, he asked me to walk up
and down a long beech avenue within sight of her.

He then said that she was the daughter of a French opera-dancer, Céline
Varens, towards whom he had once cherished what he called a “_grande
passion_.” This passion Céline had professed to return with even
superior ardour. He thought himself her idol, ugly as he was: he
believed, as he said, that she preferred his “_taille d’athlète_” to
the elegance of the Apollo Belvidere.

“And, Miss Eyre, so much was I flattered by this preference of the
Gallic sylph for her British gnome, that I installed her in an hotel;
gave her a complete establishment of servants, a carriage, cashmeres,
diamonds, dentelles, &c. In short, I began the process of ruining
myself in the received style, like any other spoony. I had not, it
seems, the originality to chalk out a new road to shame and
destruction, but trode the old track with stupid exactness not to
deviate an inch from the beaten centre. I had—as I deserved to have—the
fate of all other spoonies. Happening to call one evening when Céline
did not expect me, I found her out; but it was a warm night, and I was
tired with strolling through Paris, so I sat down in her boudoir; happy
to breathe the air consecrated so lately by her presence. No,—I
exaggerate; I never thought there was any consecrating virtue about
her: it was rather a sort of pastille perfume she had left; a scent of
musk and amber, than an odour of sanctity. I was just beginning to
stifle with the fumes of conservatory flowers and sprinkled essences,
when I bethought myself to open the window and step out on to the
balcony. It was moonlight and gaslight besides, and very still and
serene. The balcony was furnished with a chair or two; I sat down, and
took out a cigar,—I will take one now, if you will excuse me.”

Here ensued a pause, filled up by the producing and lighting of a
cigar; having placed it to his lips and breathed a trail of Havannah
incense on the freezing and sunless air, he went on—

“I liked bonbons too in those days, Miss Eyre, and I was
_croquant_—(overlook the barbarism)—_croquant_ chocolate comfits, and
smoking alternately, watching meantime the equipages that rolled along
the fashionable streets towards the neighbouring opera-house, when in
an elegant close carriage drawn by a beautiful pair of English horses,
and distinctly seen in the brilliant city-night, I recognised the
‘voiture’ I had given Céline. She was returning: of course my heart
thumped with impatience against the iron rails I leant upon. The
carriage stopped, as I had expected, at the hotel door; my flame (that
is the very word for an opera inamorata) alighted: though muffed in a
cloak—an unnecessary encumbrance, by-the-bye, on so warm a June
evening—I knew her instantly by her little foot, seen peeping from the
skirt of her dress, as she skipped from the carriage-step. Bending over
the balcony, I was about to murmur ‘Mon ange’—in a tone, of course,
which should be audible to the ear of love alone—when a figure jumped
from the carriage after her; cloaked also; but that was a spurred heel
which had rung on the pavement, and that was a hatted head which now
passed under the arched _porte cochère_ of the hotel.

“You never felt jealousy, did you, Miss Eyre? Of course not: I need not
ask you; because you never felt love. You have both sentiments yet to
experience: your soul sleeps; the shock is yet to be given which shall
waken it. You think all existence lapses in as quiet a flow as that in
which your youth has hitherto slid away. Floating on with closed eyes
and muffled ears, you neither see the rocks bristling not far off in
the bed of the flood, nor hear the breakers boil at their base. But I
tell you—and you may mark my words—you will come some day to a craggy
pass in the channel, where the whole of life’s stream will be broken up
into whirl and tumult, foam and noise: either you will be dashed to
atoms on crag points, or lifted up and borne on by some master-wave
into a calmer current—as I am now.

“I like this day; I like that sky of steel; I like the sternness and
stillness of the world under this frost. I like Thornfield, its
antiquity, its retirement, its old crow-trees and thorn-trees, its grey
façade, and lines of dark windows reflecting that metal welkin: and yet
how long have I abhorred the very thought of it, shunned it like a
great plague-house? How I do still abhor—”

He ground his teeth and was silent: he arrested his step and struck his
boot against the hard ground. Some hated thought seemed to have him in
its grip, and to hold him so tightly that he could not advance.

We were ascending the avenue when he thus paused; the hall was before
us. Lifting his eye to its battlements, he cast over them a glare such
as I never saw before or since. Pain, shame, ire, impatience, disgust,
detestation, seemed momentarily to hold a quivering conflict in the
large pupil dilating under his ebon eyebrow. Wild was the wrestle which
should be paramount; but another feeling rose and triumphed: something
hard and cynical: self-willed and resolute: it settled his passion and
petrified his countenance: he went on—

“During the moment I was silent, Miss Eyre, I was arranging a point
with my destiny. She stood there, by that beech-trunk—a hag like one of
those who appeared to Macbeth on the heath of Forres. ‘You like
Thornfield?’ she said, lifting her finger; and then she wrote in the
air a memento, which ran in lurid hieroglyphics all along the
house-front, between the upper and lower row of windows, ‘Like it if
you can! Like it if you dare!’

“‘I will like it,’ said I; ‘I dare like it;’ and” (he subjoined
moodily) “I will keep my word; I will break obstacles to happiness, to
goodness—yes, goodness. I wish to be a better man than I have been,
than I am; as Job’s leviathan broke the spear, the dart, and the
habergeon, hindrances which others count as iron and brass, I will
esteem but straw and rotten wood.”

Adèle here ran before him with her shuttlecock. “Away!” he cried
harshly; “keep at a distance, child; or go in to Sophie!” Continuing
then to pursue his walk in silence, I ventured to recall him to the
point whence he had abruptly diverged—

“Did you leave the balcony, sir,” I asked, “when Mdlle. Varens
entered?”

I almost expected a rebuff for this hardly well-timed question, but, on
the contrary, waking out of his scowling abstraction, he turned his
eyes towards me, and the shade seemed to clear off his brow. “Oh, I had
forgotten Céline! Well, to resume. When I saw my charmer thus come in
accompanied by a cavalier, I seemed to hear a hiss, and the green snake
of jealousy, rising on undulating coils from the moonlit balcony,
glided within my waistcoat, and ate its way in two minutes to my
heart’s core. Strange!” he exclaimed, suddenly starting again from the
point. “Strange that I should choose you for the confidant of all this,
young lady; passing strange that you should listen to me quietly, as if
it were the most usual thing in the world for a man like me to tell
stories of his opera-mistresses to a quaint, inexperienced girl like
you! But the last singularity explains the first, as I intimated once
before: you, with your gravity, considerateness, and caution were made
to be the recipient of secrets. Besides, I know what sort of a mind I
have placed in communication with my own: I know it is one not liable
to take infection: it is a peculiar mind: it is a unique one. Happily I
do not mean to harm it: but, if I did, it would not take harm from me.
The more you and I converse, the better; for while I cannot blight you,
you may refresh me.” After this digression he proceeded—

“I remained in the balcony. ‘They will come to her boudoir, no doubt,’
thought I: ‘let me prepare an ambush.’ So putting my hand in through
the open window, I drew the curtain over it, leaving only an opening
through which I could take observations; then I closed the casement,
all but a chink just wide enough to furnish an outlet to lovers’
whispered vows: then I stole back to my chair; and as I resumed it the
pair came in. My eye was quickly at the aperture. Céline’s chamber-maid
entered, lit a lamp, left it on the table, and withdrew. The couple
were thus revealed to me clearly: both removed their cloaks, and there
was ‘the Varens,’ shining in satin and jewels,—my gifts of course,—and
there was her companion in an officer’s uniform; and I knew him for a
young roué of a vicomte—a brainless and vicious youth whom I had
sometimes met in society, and had never thought of hating because I
despised him so absolutely. On recognising him, the fang of the snake
Jealousy was instantly broken; because at the same moment my love for
Céline sank under an extinguisher. A woman who could betray me for such
a rival was not worth contending for; she deserved only scorn; less,
however, than I, who had been her dupe.

“They began to talk; their conversation eased me completely: frivolous,
mercenary, heartless, and senseless, it was rather calculated to weary
than enrage a listener. A card of mine lay on the table; this being
perceived, brought my name under discussion. Neither of them possessed
energy or wit to belabour me soundly, but they insulted me as coarsely
as they could in their little way: especially Céline, who even waxed
rather brilliant on my personal defects—deformities she termed them.
Now it had been her custom to launch out into fervent admiration of
what she called my ‘_beauté mâle_:’ wherein she differed diametrically
from you, who told me point-blank, at the second interview, that you
did not think me handsome. The contrast struck me at the time and—”

Adèle here came running up again.

“Monsieur, John has just been to say that your agent has called and
wishes to see you.”

“Ah! in that case I must abridge. Opening the window, I walked in upon
them; liberated Céline from my protection; gave her notice to vacate
her hotel; offered her a purse for immediate exigencies; disregarded
screams, hysterics, prayers, protestations, convulsions; made an
appointment with the vicomte for a meeting at the Bois de Boulogne.
Next morning I had the pleasure of encountering him; left a bullet in
one of his poor etiolated arms, feeble as the wing of a chicken in the
pip, and then thought I had done with the whole crew. But unluckily the
Varens, six months before, had given me this filette Adèle, who, she
affirmed, was my daughter; and perhaps she may be, though I see no
proofs of such grim paternity written in her countenance: Pilot is more
like me than she. Some years after I had broken with the mother, she
abandoned her child, and ran away to Italy with a musician or singer. I
acknowledged no natural claim on Adèle’s part to be supported by me,
nor do I now acknowledge any, for I am not her father; but hearing that
she was quite destitute, I e’en took the poor thing out of the slime
and mud of Paris, and transplanted it here, to grow up clean in the
wholesome soil of an English country garden. Mrs. Fairfax found you to
train it; but now you know that it is the illegitimate offspring of a
French opera-girl, you will perhaps think differently of your post and
protégée: you will be coming to me some day with notice that you have
found another place—that you beg me to look out for a new governess,
&c.—Eh?”

“No: Adèle is not answerable for either her mother’s faults or yours: I
have a regard for her; and now that I know she is, in a sense,
parentless—forsaken by her mother and disowned by you, sir—I shall
cling closer to her than before. How could I possibly prefer the spoilt
pet of a wealthy family, who would hate her governess as a nuisance, to
a lonely little orphan, who leans towards her as a friend?”

“Oh, that is the light in which you view it! Well, I must go in now;
and you too: it darkens.”

But I stayed out a few minutes longer with Adèle and Pilot—ran a race
with her, and played a game of battledore and shuttlecock. When we went
in, and I had removed her bonnet and coat, I took her on my knee; kept
her there an hour, allowing her to prattle as she liked: not rebuking
even some little freedoms and trivialities into which she was apt to
stray when much noticed, and which betrayed in her a superficiality of
character, inherited probably from her mother, hardly congenial to an
English mind. Still she had her merits; and I was disposed to
appreciate all that was good in her to the utmost. I sought in her
countenance and features a likeness to Mr. Rochester, but found none:
no trait, no turn of expression announced relationship. It was a pity:
if she could but have been proved to resemble him, he would have
thought more of her.

It was not till after I had withdrawn to my own chamber for the night,
that I steadily reviewed the tale Mr. Rochester had told me. As he had
said, there was probably nothing at all extraordinary in the substance
of the narrative itself: a wealthy Englishman’s passion for a French
dancer, and her treachery to him, were every-day matters enough, no
doubt, in society; but there was something decidedly strange in the
paroxysm of emotion which had suddenly seized him when he was in the
act of expressing the present contentment of his mood, and his newly
revived pleasure in the old hall and its environs. I meditated
wonderingly on this incident; but gradually quitting it, as I found it
for the present inexplicable, I turned to the consideration of my
master’s manner to myself. The confidence he had thought fit to repose
in me seemed a tribute to my discretion: I regarded and accepted it as
such. His deportment had now for some weeks been more uniform towards
me than at the first. I never seemed in his way; he did not take fits
of chilling hauteur: when he met me unexpectedly, the encounter seemed
welcome; he had always a word and sometimes a smile for me: when
summoned by formal invitation to his presence, I was honoured by a
cordiality of reception that made me feel I really possessed the power
to amuse him, and that these evening conferences were sought as much
for his pleasure as for my benefit.

I, indeed, talked comparatively little, but I heard him talk with
relish. It was his nature to be communicative; he liked to open to a
mind unacquainted with the world glimpses of its scenes and ways (I do
not mean its corrupt scenes and wicked ways, but such as derived their
interest from the great scale on which they were acted, the strange
novelty by which they were characterised); and I had a keen delight in
receiving the new ideas he offered, in imagining the new pictures he
portrayed, and following him in thought through the new regions he
disclosed, never startled or troubled by one noxious allusion.

The ease of his manner freed me from painful restraint: the friendly
frankness, as correct as cordial, with which he treated me, drew me to
him. I felt at times as if he were my relation rather than my master:
yet he was imperious sometimes still; but I did not mind that; I saw it
was his way. So happy, so gratified did I become with this new interest
added to life, that I ceased to pine after kindred: my thin
crescent-destiny seemed to enlarge; the blanks of existence were filled
up; my bodily health improved; I gathered flesh and strength.

And was Mr. Rochester now ugly in my eyes? No, reader: gratitude, and
many associations, all pleasurable and genial, made his face the object
I best liked to see; his presence in a room was more cheering than the
brightest fire. Yet I had not forgotten his faults; indeed, I could
not, for he brought them frequently before me. He was proud, sardonic,
harsh to inferiority of every description: in my secret soul I knew
that his great kindness to me was balanced by unjust severity to many
others. He was moody, too; unaccountably so; I more than once, when
sent for to read to him, found him sitting in his library alone, with
his head bent on his folded arms; and, when he looked up, a morose,
almost a malignant, scowl blackened his features. But I believed that
his moodiness, his harshness, and his former faults of morality (I say
_former_, for now he seemed corrected of them) had their source in some
cruel cross of fate. I believed he was naturally a man of better
tendencies, higher principles, and purer tastes than such as
circumstances had developed, education instilled, or destiny
encouraged. I thought there were excellent materials in him; though for
the present they hung together somewhat spoiled and tangled. I cannot
deny that I grieved for his grief, whatever that was, and would have
given much to assuage it.

Though I had now extinguished my candle and was laid down in bed, I
could not sleep for thinking of his look when he paused in the avenue,
and told how his destiny had risen up before him, and dared him to be
happy at Thornfield.

“Why not?” I asked myself. “What alienates him from the house? Will he
leave it again soon? Mrs. Fairfax said he seldom stayed here longer
than a fortnight at a time; and he has now been resident eight weeks.
If he does go, the change will be doleful. Suppose he should be absent
spring, summer, and autumn: how joyless sunshine and fine days will
seem!”

I hardly know whether I had slept or not after this musing; at any
rate, I started wide awake on hearing a vague murmur, peculiar and
lugubrious, which sounded, I thought, just above me. I wished I had
kept my candle burning: the night was drearily dark; my spirits were
depressed. I rose and sat up in bed, listening. The sound was hushed.

I tried again to sleep; but my heart beat anxiously: my inward
tranquillity was broken. The clock, far down in the hall, struck two.
Just then it seemed my chamber-door was touched; as if fingers had
swept the panels in groping a way along the dark gallery outside. I
said, “Who is there?” Nothing answered. I was chilled with fear.

All at once I remembered that it might be Pilot, who, when the
kitchen-door chanced to be left open, not unfrequently found his way up
to the threshold of Mr. Rochester’s chamber: I had seen him lying there
myself in the mornings. The idea calmed me somewhat: I lay down.
Silence composes the nerves; and as an unbroken hush now reigned again
through the whole house, I began to feel the return of slumber. But it
was not fated that I should sleep that night. A dream had scarcely
approached my ear, when it fled affrighted, scared by a marrow-freezing
incident enough.

This was a demoniac laugh—low, suppressed, and deep—uttered, as it
seemed, at the very keyhole of my chamber door. The head of my bed was
near the door, and I thought at first the goblin-laugher stood at my
bedside—or rather, crouched by my pillow: but I rose, looked round, and
could see nothing; while, as I still gazed, the unnatural sound was
reiterated: and I knew it came from behind the panels. My first impulse
was to rise and fasten the bolt; my next, again to cry out, “Who is
there?”

Something gurgled and moaned. Ere long, steps retreated up the gallery
towards the third-storey staircase: a door had lately been made to shut
in that staircase; I heard it open and close, and all was still.

“Was that Grace Poole? and is she possessed with a devil?” thought I.
Impossible now to remain longer by myself: I must go to Mrs. Fairfax. I
hurried on my frock and a shawl; I withdrew the bolt and opened the
door with a trembling hand. There was a candle burning just outside,
and on the matting in the gallery. I was surprised at this
circumstance: but still more was I amazed to perceive the air quite
dim, as if filled with smoke; and, while looking to the right hand and
left, to find whence these blue wreaths issued, I became further aware
of a strong smell of burning.

Something creaked: it was a door ajar; and that door was Mr.
Rochester’s, and the smoke rushed in a cloud from thence. I thought no
more of Mrs. Fairfax; I thought no more of Grace Poole, or the laugh:
in an instant, I was within the chamber. Tongues of flame darted round
the bed: the curtains were on fire. In the midst of blaze and vapour,
Mr. Rochester lay stretched motionless, in deep sleep.

“Wake! wake!” I cried. I shook him, but he only murmured and turned:
the smoke had stupefied him. Not a moment could be lost: the very
sheets were kindling, I rushed to his basin and ewer; fortunately, one
was wide and the other deep, and both were filled with water. I heaved
them up, deluged the bed and its occupant, flew back to my own room,
brought my own water-jug, baptized the couch afresh, and, by God’s aid,
succeeded in extinguishing the flames which were devouring it.

The hiss of the quenched element, the breakage of a pitcher which I
flung from my hand when I had emptied it, and, above all, the splash of
the shower-bath I had liberally bestowed, roused Mr. Rochester at last.
Though it was now dark, I knew he was awake; because I heard him
fulminating strange anathemas at finding himself lying in a pool of
water.

“Is there a flood?” he cried.

“No, sir,” I answered; “but there has been a fire: get up, do; you are
quenched now; I will fetch you a candle.”

“In the name of all the elves in Christendom, is that Jane Eyre?” he
demanded. “What have you done with me, witch, sorceress? Who is in the
room besides you? Have you plotted to drown me?”

“I will fetch you a candle, sir; and, in Heaven’s name, get up.
Somebody has plotted something: you cannot too soon find out who and
what it is.”

“There! I am up now; but at your peril you fetch a candle yet: wait two
minutes till I get into some dry garments, if any dry there be—yes,
here is my dressing-gown. Now run!”

I did run; I brought the candle which still remained in the gallery. He
took it from my hand, held it up, and surveyed the bed, all blackened
and scorched, the sheets drenched, the carpet round swimming in water.

“What is it? and who did it?” he asked.

I briefly related to him what had transpired: the strange laugh I had
heard in the gallery: the step ascending to the third storey; the
smoke,—the smell of fire which had conducted me to his room; in what
state I had found matters there, and how I had deluged him with all the
water I could lay hands on.


“What is it and who did it?” he asked

He listened very gravely; his face, as I went on, expressed more
concern than astonishment; he did not immediately speak when I had
concluded.

“Shall I call Mrs. Fairfax?” I asked.

“Mrs. Fairfax? No; what the deuce would you call her for? What can she
do? Let her sleep unmolested.”

“Then I will fetch Leah, and wake John and his wife.”

“Not at all: just be still. You have a shawl on. If you are not warm
enough, you may take my cloak yonder; wrap it about you, and sit down
in the arm-chair: there,—I will put it on. Now place your feet on the
stool, to keep them out of the wet. I am going to leave you a few
minutes. I shall take the candle. Remain where you are till I return;
be as still as a mouse. I must pay a visit to the second storey. Don’t
move, remember, or call any one.”

He went: I watched the light withdraw. He passed up the gallery very
softly, unclosed the staircase door with as little noise as possible,
shut it after him, and the last ray vanished. I was left in total
darkness. I listened for some noise, but heard nothing. A very long
time elapsed. I grew weary: it was cold, in spite of the cloak; and
then I did not see the use of staying, as I was not to rouse the house.
I was on the point of risking Mr. Rochester’s displeasure by disobeying
his orders, when the light once more gleamed dimly on the gallery wall,
and I heard his unshod feet tread the matting. “I hope it is he,”
thought I, “and not something worse.”

He re-entered, pale and very gloomy. “I have found it all out,” said
he, setting his candle down on the washstand; “it is as I thought.”

“How, sir?”

He made no reply, but stood with his arms folded, looking on the
ground. At the end of a few minutes he inquired in rather a peculiar
tone—

“I forget whether you said you saw anything when you opened your
chamber door.”

“No, sir, only the candlestick on the ground.”

“But you heard an odd laugh? You have heard that laugh before, I should
think, or something like it?”

“Yes, sir: there is a woman who sews here, called Grace Poole,—she
laughs in that way. She is a singular person.”

“Just so. Grace Poole—you have guessed it. She is, as you say,
singular—very. Well, I shall reflect on the subject. Meantime, I am
glad that you are the only person, besides myself, acquainted with the
precise details of to-night’s incident. You are no talking fool: say
nothing about it. I will account for this state of affairs” (pointing
to the bed): “and now return to your own room. I shall do very well on
the sofa in the library for the rest of the night. It is near four:—in
two hours the servants will be up.”

“Good-night, then, sir,” said I, departing.

He seemed surprised—very inconsistently so, as he had just told me to
go.

“What!” he exclaimed, “are you quitting me already, and in that way?”

“You said I might go, sir.”

“But not without taking leave; not without a word or two of
acknowledgment and good-will: not, in short, in that brief, dry
fashion. Why, you have saved my life!—snatched me from a horrible and
excruciating death! and you walk past me as if we were mutual
strangers! At least shake hands.”

He held out his hand; I gave him mine: he took it first in one, then in
both his own.

“You have saved my life: I have a pleasure in owing you so immense a
debt. I cannot say more. Nothing else that has being would have been
tolerable to me in the character of creditor for such an obligation:
but you: it is different;—I feel your benefits no burden, Jane.”

He paused; gazed at me: words almost visible trembled on his lips,—but
his voice was checked.

“Good-night again, sir. There is no debt, benefit, burden, obligation,
in the case.”

“I knew,” he continued, “you would do me good in some way, at some
time;—I saw it in your eyes when I first beheld you: their expression
and smile did not”—(again he stopped)—“did not” (he proceeded hastily)
“strike delight to my very inmost heart so for nothing. People talk of
natural sympathies; I have heard of good genii: there are grains of
truth in the wildest fable. My cherished preserver, good-night!”

Strange energy was in his voice, strange fire in his look.

“I am glad I happened to be awake,” I said: and then I was going.

“What! you _will_ go?”

“I am cold, sir.”

“Cold? Yes,—and standing in a pool! Go, then, Jane; go!” But he still
retained my hand, and I could not free it. I bethought myself of an
expedient.

“I think I hear Mrs. Fairfax move, sir,” said I.

“Well, leave me:” he relaxed his fingers, and I was gone.

I regained my couch, but never thought of sleep. Till morning dawned I
was tossed on a buoyant but unquiet sea, where billows of trouble
rolled under surges of joy. I thought sometimes I saw beyond its wild
waters a shore, sweet as the hills of Beulah; and now and then a
freshening gale, wakened by hope, bore my spirit triumphantly towards
the bourne: but I could not reach it, even in fancy—a counteracting
breeze blew off land, and continually drove me back. Sense would resist
delirium: judgment would warn passion. Too feverish to rest, I rose as
soon as day dawned.




CHAPTER XVI


I both wished and feared to see Mr. Rochester on the day which followed
this sleepless night: I wanted to hear his voice again, yet feared to
meet his eye. During the early part of the morning, I momentarily
expected his coming; he was not in the frequent habit of entering the
schoolroom, but he did step in for a few minutes sometimes, and I had
the impression that he was sure to visit it that day.

But the morning passed just as usual: nothing happened to interrupt the
quiet course of Adèle’s studies; only soon after breakfast, I heard
some bustle in the neighbourhood of Mr. Rochester’s chamber, Mrs.
Fairfax’s voice, and Leah’s, and the cook’s—that is, John’s wife—and
even John’s own gruff tones. There were exclamations of “What a mercy
master was not burnt in his bed!” “It is always dangerous to keep a
candle lit at night.” “How providential that he had presence of mind to
think of the water-jug!” “I wonder he waked nobody!” “It is to be hoped
he will not take cold with sleeping on the library sofa,” &c.

To much confabulation succeeded a sound of scrubbing and setting to
rights; and when I passed the room, in going downstairs to dinner, I
saw through the open door that all was again restored to complete
order; only the bed was stripped of its hangings. Leah stood up in the
window-seat, rubbing the panes of glass dimmed with smoke. I was about
to address her, for I wished to know what account had been given of the
affair: but, on advancing, I saw a second person in the chamber—a woman
sitting on a chair by the bedside, and sewing rings to new curtains.
That woman was no other than Grace Poole.

There she sat, staid and taciturn-looking, as usual, in her brown stuff
gown, her check apron, white handkerchief, and cap. She was intent on
her work, in which her whole thoughts seemed absorbed: on her hard
forehead, and in her commonplace features, was nothing either of the
paleness or desperation one would have expected to see marking the
countenance of a woman who had attempted murder, and whose intended
victim had followed her last night to her lair, and (as I believed),
charged her with the crime she wished to perpetrate. I was
amazed—confounded. She looked up, while I still gazed at her: no start,
no increase or failure of colour betrayed emotion, consciousness of
guilt, or fear of detection. She said “Good morning, Miss,” in her
usual phlegmatic and brief manner; and taking up another ring and more
tape, went on with her sewing.

“I will put her to some test,” thought I: “such absolute
impenetrability is past comprehension.”

“Good morning, Grace,” I said. “Has anything happened here? I thought I
heard the servants all talking together a while ago.”

“Only master had been reading in his bed last night; he fell asleep
with his candle lit, and the curtains got on fire; but, fortunately, he
awoke before the bed-clothes or the wood-work caught, and contrived to
quench the flames with the water in the ewer.”

“A strange affair!” I said, in a low voice: then, looking at her
fixedly—“Did Mr. Rochester wake nobody? Did no one hear him move?”

She again raised her eyes to me, and this time there was something of
consciousness in their expression. She seemed to examine me warily;
then she answered—

“The servants sleep so far off, you know, Miss, they would not be
likely to hear. Mrs. Fairfax’s room and yours are the nearest to
master’s; but Mrs. Fairfax said she heard nothing: when people get
elderly, they often sleep heavy.” She paused, and then added, with a
sort of assumed indifference, but still in a marked and significant
tone—“But you are young, Miss; and I should say a light sleeper:
perhaps you may have heard a noise?”

“I did,” said I, dropping my voice, so that Leah, who was still
polishing the panes, could not hear me, “and at first I thought it was
Pilot: but Pilot cannot laugh; and I am certain I heard a laugh, and a
strange one.”

She took a new needleful of thread, waxed it carefully, threaded her
needle with a steady hand, and then observed, with perfect composure—

“It is hardly likely master would laugh, I should think, Miss, when he
was in such danger: You must have been dreaming.”

“I was not dreaming,” I said, with some warmth, for her brazen coolness
provoked me. Again she looked at me; and with the same scrutinising and
conscious eye.

“Have you told master that you heard a laugh?” she inquired.

“I have not had the opportunity of speaking to him this morning.”

“You did not think of opening your door and looking out into the
gallery?” she further asked.

She appeared to be cross-questioning me, attempting to draw from me
information unawares. The idea struck me that if she discovered I knew
or suspected her guilt, she would be playing of some of her malignant
pranks on me; I thought it advisable to be on my guard.

“On the contrary,” said I, “I bolted my door.”

“Then you are not in the habit of bolting your door every night before
you get into bed?”

“Fiend! she wants to know my habits, that she may lay her plans
accordingly!” Indignation again prevailed over prudence: I replied
sharply, “Hitherto I have often omitted to fasten the bolt: I did not
think it necessary. I was not aware any danger or annoyance was to be
dreaded at Thornfield Hall: but in future” (and I laid marked stress on
the words) “I shall take good care to make all secure before I venture
to lie down.”

“It will be wise so to do,” was her answer: “this neighbourhood is as
quiet as any I know, and I never heard of the hall being attempted by
robbers since it was a house; though there are hundreds of pounds’
worth of plate in the plate-closet, as is well known. And you see, for
such a large house, there are very few servants, because master has
never lived here much; and when he does come, being a bachelor, he
needs little waiting on: but I always think it best to err on the safe
side; a door is soon fastened, and it is as well to have a drawn bolt
between one and any mischief that may be about. A deal of people, Miss,
are for trusting all to Providence; but I say Providence will not
dispense with the means, though He often blesses them when they are
used discreetly.” And here she closed her harangue: a long one for her,
and uttered with the demureness of a Quakeress.

I still stood absolutely dumfoundered at what appeared to me her
miraculous self-possession and most inscrutable hypocrisy, when the
cook entered.

“Mrs. Poole,” said she, addressing Grace, “the servants’ dinner will
soon be ready: will you come down?”

“No; just put my pint of porter and bit of pudding on a tray, and I’ll
carry it upstairs.”

“You’ll have some meat?”

“Just a morsel, and a taste of cheese, that’s all.”

“And the sago?”

“Never mind it at present: I shall be coming down before teatime: I’ll
make it myself.”

The cook here turned to me, saying that Mrs. Fairfax was waiting for
me: so I departed.

I hardly heard Mrs. Fairfax’s account of the curtain conflagration
during dinner, so much was I occupied in puzzling my brains over the
enigmatical character of Grace Poole, and still more in pondering the
problem of her position at Thornfield and questioning why she had not
been given into custody that morning, or, at the very least, dismissed
from her master’s service. He had almost as much as declared his
conviction of her criminality last night: what mysterious cause
withheld him from accusing her? Why had he enjoined me, too, to
secrecy? It was strange: a bold, vindictive, and haughty gentleman
seemed somehow in the power of one of the meanest of his dependents; so
much in her power, that even when she lifted her hand against his life,
he dared not openly charge her with the attempt, much less punish her
for it.

Had Grace been young and handsome, I should have been tempted to think
that tenderer feelings than prudence or fear influenced Mr. Rochester
in her behalf; but, hard-favoured and matronly as she was, the idea
could not be admitted. “Yet,” I reflected, “she has been young once;
her youth would be contemporary with her master’s: Mrs. Fairfax told me
once, she had lived here many years. I don’t think she can ever have
been pretty; but, for aught I know, she may possess originality and
strength of character to compensate for the want of personal
advantages. Mr. Rochester is an amateur of the decided and eccentric:
Grace is eccentric at least. What if a former caprice (a freak very
possible to a nature so sudden and headstrong as his) has delivered him
into her power, and she now exercises over his actions a secret
influence, the result of his own indiscretion, which he cannot shake
off, and dare not disregard?” But, having reached this point of
conjecture, Mrs. Poole’s square, flat figure, and uncomely, dry, even
coarse face, recurred so distinctly to my mind’s eye, that I thought,
“No; impossible! my supposition cannot be correct. Yet,” suggested the
secret voice which talks to us in our own hearts, “_you_ are not
beautiful either, and perhaps Mr. Rochester approves you: at any rate,
you have often felt as if he did; and last night—remember his words;
remember his look; remember his voice!”

I well remembered all; language, glance, and tone seemed at the moment
vividly renewed. I was now in the schoolroom; Adèle was drawing; I bent
over her and directed her pencil. She looked up with a sort of start.

“Qu’avez-vous, mademoiselle?” said she. “Vos doigts tremblent comme la
feuille, et vos joues sont rouges: mais, rouges comme des cerises!”

“I am hot, Adèle, with stooping!” She went on sketching; I went on
thinking.

I hastened to drive from my mind the hateful notion I had been
conceiving respecting Grace Poole; it disgusted me. I compared myself
with her, and found we were different. Bessie Leaven had said I was
quite a lady; and she spoke truth—I was a lady. And now I looked much
better than I did when Bessie saw me; I had more colour and more flesh,
more life, more vivacity, because I had brighter hopes and keener
enjoyments.

“Evening approaches,” said I, as I looked towards the window. “I have
never heard Mr. Rochester’s voice or step in the house to-day; but
surely I shall see him before night: I feared the meeting in the
morning; now I desire it, because expectation has been so long baffled
that it is grown impatient.”

When dusk actually closed, and when Adèle left me to go and play in the
nursery with Sophie, I did most keenly desire it. I listened for the
bell to ring below; I listened for Leah coming up with a message; I
fancied sometimes I heard Mr. Rochester’s own tread, and I turned to
the door, expecting it to open and admit him. The door remained shut;
darkness only came in through the window. Still it was not late; he
often sent for me at seven and eight o’clock, and it was yet but six.
Surely I should not be wholly disappointed to-night, when I had so many
things to say to him! I wanted again to introduce the subject of Grace
Poole, and to hear what he would answer; I wanted to ask him plainly if
he really believed it was she who had made last night’s hideous
attempt; and if so, why he kept her wickedness a secret. It little
mattered whether my curiosity irritated him; I knew the pleasure of
vexing and soothing him by turns; it was one I chiefly delighted in,
and a sure instinct always prevented me from going too far; beyond the
verge of provocation I never ventured; on the extreme brink I liked
well to try my skill. Retaining every minute form of respect, every
propriety of my station, I could still meet him in argument without
fear or uneasy restraint; this suited both him and me.

A tread creaked on the stairs at last. Leah made her appearance; but it
was only to intimate that tea was ready in Mrs. Fairfax’s room. Thither
I repaired, glad at least to go downstairs; for that brought me, I
imagined, nearer to Mr. Rochester’s presence.

“You must want your tea,” said the good lady, as I joined her; “you ate
so little at dinner. I am afraid,” she continued, “you are not well
to-day: you look flushed and feverish.”

“Oh, quite well! I never felt better.”

“Then you must prove it by evincing a good appetite; will you fill the
teapot while I knit off this needle?” Having completed her task, she
rose to draw down the blind, which she had hitherto kept up, by way, I
suppose, of making the most of daylight, though dusk was now fast
deepening into total obscurity.

“It is fair to-night,” said she, as she looked through the panes,
“though not starlight; Mr. Rochester has, on the whole, had a
favourable day for his journey.”

“Journey!—Is Mr. Rochester gone anywhere? I did not know he was out.”

“Oh, he set off the moment he had breakfasted! He is gone to the Leas,
Mr. Eshton’s place, ten miles on the other side Millcote. I believe
there is quite a party assembled there; Lord Ingram, Sir George Lynn,
Colonel Dent, and others.”

“Do you expect him back to-night?”

“No—nor to-morrow either; I should think he is very likely to stay a
week or more: when these fine, fashionable people get together, they
are so surrounded by elegance and gaiety, so well provided with all
that can please and entertain, they are in no hurry to separate.
Gentlemen especially are often in request on such occasions; and Mr.
Rochester is so talented and so lively in society, that I believe he is
a general favourite: the ladies are very fond of him; though you would
not think his appearance calculated to recommend him particularly in
their eyes: but I suppose his acquirements and abilities, perhaps his
wealth and good blood, make amends for any little fault of look.”

“Are there ladies at the Leas?”

“There are Mrs. Eshton and her three daughters—very elegant young
ladies indeed; and there are the Honourable Blanche and Mary Ingram,
most beautiful women, I suppose: indeed I have seen Blanche, six or
seven years since, when she was a girl of eighteen. She came here to a
Christmas ball and party Mr. Rochester gave. You should have seen the
dining-room that day—how richly it was decorated, how brilliantly lit
up! I should think there were fifty ladies and gentlemen present—all of
the first county families; and Miss Ingram was considered the belle of
the evening.”

“You saw her, you say, Mrs. Fairfax: what was she like?”

“Yes, I saw her. The dining-room doors were thrown open; and, as it was
Christmas-time, the servants were allowed to assemble in the hall, to
hear some of the ladies sing and play. Mr. Rochester would have me to
come in, and I sat down in a quiet corner and watched them. I never saw
a more splendid scene: the ladies were magnificently dressed; most of
them—at least most of the younger ones—looked handsome; but Miss Ingram
was certainly the queen.”

“And what was she like?”

“Tall, fine bust, sloping shoulders; long, graceful neck: olive
complexion, dark and clear; noble features; eyes rather like Mr.
Rochester’s: large and black, and as brilliant as her jewels. And then
she had such a fine head of hair; raven-black and so becomingly
arranged: a crown of thick plaits behind, and in front the longest, the
glossiest curls I ever saw. She was dressed in pure white; an
amber-coloured scarf was passed over her shoulder and across her
breast, tied at the side, and descending in long, fringed ends below
her knee. She wore an amber-coloured flower, too, in her hair: it
contrasted well with the jetty mass of her curls.”

“She was greatly admired, of course?”

“Yes, indeed: and not only for her beauty, but for her accomplishments.
She was one of the ladies who sang: a gentleman accompanied her on the
piano. She and Mr. Rochester sang a duet.”

“Mr. Rochester? I was not aware he could sing.”

“Oh! he has a fine bass voice, and an excellent taste for music.”

“And Miss Ingram: what sort of a voice had she?”

“A very rich and powerful one: she sang delightfully; it was a treat to
listen to her;—and she played afterwards. I am no judge of music, but
Mr. Rochester is; and I heard him say her execution was remarkably
good.”

“And this beautiful and accomplished lady, she is not yet married?”

“It appears not: I fancy neither she nor her sister have very large
fortunes. Old Lord Ingram’s estates were chiefly entailed, and the
eldest son came in for everything almost.”

“But I wonder no wealthy nobleman or gentleman has taken a fancy to
her: Mr. Rochester, for instance. He is rich, is he not?”

“Oh! yes. But you see there is a considerable difference in age: Mr.
Rochester is nearly forty; she is but twenty-five.”

“What of that? More unequal matches are made every day.”

“True: yet I should scarcely fancy Mr. Rochester would entertain an
idea of the sort. But you eat nothing: you have scarcely tasted since
you began tea.”

“No: I am too thirsty to eat. Will you let me have another cup?”

I was about again to revert to the probability of a union between Mr.
Rochester and the beautiful Blanche; but Adèle came in, and the
conversation was turned into another channel.

When once more alone, I reviewed the information I had got; looked into
my heart, examined its thoughts and feelings, and endeavoured to bring
back with a strict hand such as had been straying through imagination’s
boundless and trackless waste, into the safe fold of common sense.

Arraigned at my own bar, Memory having given her evidence of the hopes,
wishes, sentiments I had been cherishing since last night—of the
general state of mind in which I had indulged for nearly a fortnight
past; Reason having come forward and told, in her own quiet way, a
plain, unvarnished tale, showing how I had rejected the real, and
rabidly devoured the ideal;—I pronounced judgment to this effect:—

That a greater fool than Jane Eyre had never breathed the breath of
life; that a more fantastic idiot had never surfeited herself on sweet
lies, and swallowed poison as if it were nectar.

“_You_,” I said, “a favourite with Mr. Rochester? _You_ gifted with the
power of pleasing him? _You_ of importance to him in any way? Go! your
folly sickens me. And you have derived pleasure from occasional tokens
of preference—equivocal tokens shown by a gentleman of family and a man
of the world to a dependent and a novice. How dared you? Poor stupid
dupe!—Could not even self-interest make you wiser? You repeated to
yourself this morning the brief scene of last night?—Cover your face
and be ashamed! He said something in praise of your eyes, did he? Blind
puppy! Open their bleared lids and look on your own accursed
senselessness! It does good to no woman to be flattered by her
superior, who cannot possibly intend to marry her; and it is madness in
all women to let a secret love kindle within them, which, if unreturned
and unknown, must devour the life that feeds it; and, if discovered and
responded to, must lead, _ignis-fatuus_-like, into miry wilds whence
there is no extrication.

“Listen, then, Jane Eyre, to your sentence: to-morrow, place the glass
before you, and draw in chalk your own picture, faithfully, without
softening one defect; omit no harsh line, smooth away no displeasing
irregularity; write under it, ‘Portrait of a Governess, disconnected,
poor, and plain.’

“Afterwards, take a piece of smooth ivory—you have one prepared in your
drawing-box: take your palette, mix your freshest, finest, clearest
tints; choose your most delicate camel-hair pencils; delineate
carefully the loveliest face you can imagine; paint it in your softest
shades and sweetest lines, according to the description given by Mrs.
Fairfax of Blanche Ingram; remember the raven ringlets, the oriental
eye;—What! you revert to Mr. Rochester as a model! Order! No snivel!—no
sentiment!—no regret! I will endure only sense and resolution. Recall
the august yet harmonious lineaments, the Grecian neck and bust; let
the round and dazzling arm be visible, and the delicate hand; omit
neither diamond ring nor gold bracelet; portray faithfully the attire,
aërial lace and glistening satin, graceful scarf and golden rose; call
it ‘Blanche, an accomplished lady of rank.’

“Whenever, in future, you should chance to fancy Mr. Rochester thinks
well of you, take out these two pictures and compare them: say, ‘Mr.
Rochester might probably win that noble lady’s love, if he chose to
strive for it; is it likely he would waste a serious thought on this
indigent and insignificant plebeian?’”

“I’ll do it,” I resolved: and having framed this determination, I grew
calm, and fell asleep.

I kept my word. An hour or two sufficed to sketch my own portrait in
crayons; and in less than a fortnight I had completed an ivory
miniature of an imaginary Blanche Ingram. It looked a lovely face
enough, and when compared with the real head in chalk, the contrast was
as great as self-control could desire. I derived benefit from the task:
it had kept my head and hands employed, and had given force and
fixedness to the new impressions I wished to stamp indelibly on my
heart.

Ere long, I had reason to congratulate myself on the course of
wholesome discipline to which I had thus forced my feelings to submit.
Thanks to it, I was able to meet subsequent occurrences with a decent
calm, which, had they found me unprepared, I should probably have been
unequal to maintain, even externally.




CHAPTER XVII


A week passed, and no news arrived of Mr. Rochester: ten days, and
still he did not come. Mrs. Fairfax said she should not be surprised if
he were to go straight from the Leas to London, and thence to the
Continent, and not show his face again at Thornfield for a year to
come; he had not unfrequently quitted it in a manner quite as abrupt
and unexpected. When I heard this, I was beginning to feel a strange
chill and failing at the heart. I was actually permitting myself to
experience a sickening sense of disappointment; but rallying my wits,
and recollecting my principles, I at once called my sensations to
order; and it was wonderful how I got over the temporary blunder—how I
cleared up the mistake of supposing Mr. Rochester’s movements a matter
in which I had any cause to take a vital interest. Not that I humbled
myself by a slavish notion of inferiority: on the contrary, I just
said—

“You have nothing to do with the master of Thornfield, further than to
receive the salary he gives you for teaching his protégée, and to be
grateful for such respectful and kind treatment as, if you do your
duty, you have a right to expect at his hands. Be sure that is the only
tie he seriously acknowledges between you and him; so don’t make him
the object of your fine feelings, your raptures, agonies, and so forth.
He is not of your order: keep to your caste, and be too self-respecting
to lavish the love of the whole heart, soul, and strength, where such a
gift is not wanted and would be despised.”

I went on with my day’s business tranquilly; but ever and anon vague
suggestions kept wandering across my brain of reasons why I should quit
Thornfield; and I kept involuntarily framing advertisements and
pondering conjectures about new situations: these thoughts I did not
think to check; they might germinate and bear fruit if they could.

Mr. Rochester had been absent upwards of a fortnight, when the post
brought Mrs. Fairfax a letter.

“It is from the master,” said she, as she looked at the direction. “Now
I suppose we shall know whether we are to expect his return or not.”

And while she broke the seal and perused the document, I went on taking
my coffee (we were at breakfast): it was hot, and I attributed to that
circumstance a fiery glow which suddenly rose to my face. Why my hand
shook, and why I involuntarily spilt half the contents of my cup into
my saucer, I did not choose to consider.

“Well, I sometimes think we are too quiet; but we run a chance of being
busy enough now: for a little while at least,” said Mrs. Fairfax, still
holding the note before her spectacles.

Ere I permitted myself to request an explanation, I tied the string of
Adèle’s pinafore, which happened to be loose: having helped her also to
another bun and refilled her mug with milk, I said, nonchalantly—

“Mr. Rochester is not likely to return soon, I suppose?”

“Indeed he is—in three days, he says: that will be next Thursday; and
not alone either. I don’t know how many of the fine people at the Leas
are coming with him: he sends directions for all the best bedrooms to
be prepared; and the library and drawing-rooms are to be cleaned out; I
am to get more kitchen hands from the George Inn, at Millcote, and from
wherever else I can; and the ladies will bring their maids and the
gentlemen their valets: so we shall have a full house of it.” And Mrs.
Fairfax swallowed her breakfast and hastened away to commence
operations.

The three days were, as she had foretold, busy enough. I had thought
all the rooms at Thornfield beautifully clean and well arranged; but it
appears I was mistaken. Three women were got to help; and such
scrubbing, such brushing, such washing of paint and beating of carpets,
such taking down and putting up of pictures, such polishing of mirrors
and lustres, such lighting of fires in bedrooms, such airing of sheets
and feather-beds on hearths, I never beheld, either before or since.
Adèle ran quite wild in the midst of it: the preparations for company
and the prospect of their arrival, seemed to throw her into ecstasies.
She would have Sophie to look over all her “toilettes,” as she called
frocks; to furbish up any that were “_passées_,” and to air and arrange
the new. For herself, she did nothing but caper about in the front
chambers, jump on and off the bedsteads, and lie on the mattresses and
piled-up bolsters and pillows before the enormous fires roaring in the
chimneys. From school duties she was exonerated: Mrs. Fairfax had
pressed me into her service, and I was all day in the storeroom,
helping (or hindering) her and the cook; learning to make custards and
cheese-cakes and French pastry, to truss game and garnish
desert-dishes.

The party were expected to arrive on Thursday afternoon, in time for
dinner at six. During the intervening period I had no time to nurse
chimeras; and I believe I was as active and gay as anybody—Adèle
excepted. Still, now and then, I received a damping check to my
cheerfulness; and was, in spite of myself, thrown back on the region of
doubts and portents, and dark conjectures. This was when I chanced to
see the third-storey staircase door (which of late had always been kept
locked) open slowly, and give passage to the form of Grace Poole, in
prim cap, white apron, and handkerchief; when I watched her glide along
the gallery, her quiet tread muffled in a list slipper; when I saw her
look into the bustling, topsy-turvy bedrooms,—just say a word, perhaps,
to the charwoman about the proper way to polish a grate, or clean a
marble mantelpiece, or take stains from papered walls, and then pass
on. She would thus descend to the kitchen once a day, eat her dinner,
smoke a moderate pipe on the hearth, and go back, carrying her pot of
porter with her, for her private solace, in her own gloomy, upper
haunt. Only one hour in the twenty-four did she pass with her
fellow-servants below; all the rest of her time was spent in some
low-ceiled, oaken chamber of the second storey: there she sat and
sewed—and probably laughed drearily to herself,—as companionless as a
prisoner in his dungeon.

The strangest thing of all was, that not a soul in the house, except
me, noticed her habits, or seemed to marvel at them: no one discussed
her position or employment; no one pitied her solitude or isolation. I
once, indeed, overheard part of a dialogue between Leah and one of the
charwomen, of which Grace formed the subject. Leah had been saying
something I had not caught, and the charwoman remarked—

“She gets good wages, I guess?”

“Yes,” said Leah; “I wish I had as good; not that mine are to complain
of,—there’s no stinginess at Thornfield; but they’re not one fifth of
the sum Mrs. Poole receives. And she is laying by: she goes every
quarter to the bank at Millcote. I should not wonder but she has saved
enough to keep her independent if she liked to leave; but I suppose
she’s got used to the place; and then she’s not forty yet, and strong
and able for anything. It is too soon for her to give up business.”

“She is a good hand, I daresay,” said the charwoman.

“Ah!—she understands what she has to do,—nobody better,” rejoined Leah
significantly; “and it is not every one could fill her shoes—not for
all the money she gets.”

“That it is not!” was the reply. “I wonder whether the master—”

The charwoman was going on; but here Leah turned and perceived me, and
she instantly gave her companion a nudge.

“Doesn’t she know?” I heard the woman whisper.

Leah shook her head, and the conversation was of course dropped. All I
had gathered from it amounted to this,—that there was a mystery at
Thornfield; and that from participation in that mystery I was purposely
excluded.

Thursday came: all work had been completed the previous evening;
carpets were laid down, bed-hangings festooned, radiant white
counterpanes spread, toilet tables arranged, furniture rubbed, flowers
piled in vases: both chambers and saloons looked as fresh and bright as
hands could make them. The hall, too, was scoured; and the great carved
clock, as well as the steps and banisters of the staircase, were
polished to the brightness of glass; in the dining-room, the sideboard
flashed resplendent with plate; in the drawing-room and boudoir, vases
of exotics bloomed on all sides.

Afternoon arrived: Mrs. Fairfax assumed her best black satin gown, her
gloves, and her gold watch; for it was her part to receive the
company,—to conduct the ladies to their rooms, &c. Adèle, too, would be
dressed: though I thought she had little chance of being introduced to
the party that day at least. However, to please her, I allowed Sophie
to apparel her in one of her short, full muslin frocks. For myself, I
had no need to make any change; I should not be called upon to quit my
sanctum of the schoolroom; for a sanctum it was now become to me,—“a
very pleasant refuge in time of trouble.”

It had been a mild, serene spring day—one of those days which, towards
the end of March or the beginning of April, rise shining over the earth
as heralds of summer. It was drawing to an end now; but the evening was
even warm, and I sat at work in the schoolroom with the window open.

“It gets late,” said Mrs. Fairfax, entering in rustling state. “I am
glad I ordered dinner an hour after the time Mr. Rochester mentioned;
for it is past six now. I have sent John down to the gates to see if
there is anything on the road: one can see a long way from thence in
the direction of Millcote.” She went to the window. “Here he is!” said
she. “Well, John” (leaning out), “any news?”

“They’re coming, ma’am,” was the answer. “They’ll be here in ten
minutes.”

Adèle flew to the window. I followed, taking care to stand on one side,
so that, screened by the curtain, I could see without being seen.

The ten minutes John had given seemed very long, but at last wheels
were heard; four equestrians galloped up the drive, and after them came
two open carriages. Fluttering veils and waving plumes filled the
vehicles; two of the cavaliers were young, dashing-looking gentlemen;
the third was Mr. Rochester, on his black horse, Mesrour, Pilot
bounding before him; at his side rode a lady, and he and she were the
first of the party. Her purple riding-habit almost swept the ground,
her veil streamed long on the breeze; mingling with its transparent
folds, and gleaming through them, shone rich raven ringlets.

“Miss Ingram!” exclaimed Mrs. Fairfax, and away she hurried to her post
below.

The cavalcade, following the sweep of the drive, quickly turned the
angle of the house, and I lost sight of it. Adèle now petitioned to go
down; but I took her on my knee, and gave her to understand that she
must not on any account think of venturing in sight of the ladies,
either now or at any other time, unless expressly sent for: that Mr.
Rochester would be very angry, &c. “Some natural tears she shed” on
being told this; but as I began to look very grave, she consented at
last to wipe them.

A joyous stir was now audible in the hall: gentlemen’s deep tones and
ladies’ silvery accents blent harmoniously together, and
distinguishable above all, though not loud, was the sonorous voice of
the master of Thornfield Hall, welcoming his fair and gallant guests
under its roof. Then light steps ascended the stairs; and there was a
tripping through the gallery, and soft cheerful laughs, and opening and
closing doors, and, for a time, a hush.

“Elles changent de toilettes,” said Adèle; who, listening attentively,
had followed every movement; and she sighed.

“Chez maman,” said she, “quand il y avait du monde, je le suivais
partout, au salon et à leurs chambres; souvent je regardais les femmes
de chambre coiffer et habiller les dames, et c’était si amusant: comme
cela on apprend.”

“Don’t you feel hungry, Adèle?”

“Mais oui, mademoiselle: voilà cinq ou six heures que nous n’avons pas
mangé.”

“Well now, while the ladies are in their rooms, I will venture down and
get you something to eat.”

And issuing from my asylum with precaution, I sought a back-stairs
which conducted directly to the kitchen. All in that region was fire
and commotion; the soup and fish were in the last stage of projection,
and the cook hung over her crucibles in a frame of mind and body
threatening spontaneous combustion. In the servants’ hall two coachmen
and three gentlemen’s gentlemen stood or sat round the fire; the
abigails, I suppose, were upstairs with their mistresses; the new
servants, that had been hired from Millcote, were bustling about
everywhere. Threading this chaos, I at last reached the larder; there I
took possession of a cold chicken, a roll of bread, some tarts, a plate
or two and a knife and fork: with this booty I made a hasty retreat. I
had regained the gallery, and was just shutting the back-door behind
me, when an accelerated hum warned me that the ladies were about to
issue from their chambers. I could not proceed to the schoolroom
without passing some of their doors, and running the risk of being
surprised with my cargo of victualage; so I stood still at this end,
which, being windowless, was dark: quite dark now, for the sun was set
and twilight gathering.

Presently the chambers gave up their fair tenants one after another:
each came out gaily and airily, with dress that gleamed lustrous
through the dusk. For a moment they stood grouped together at the other
extremity of the gallery, conversing in a key of sweet subdued
vivacity: they then descended the staircase almost as noiselessly as a
bright mist rolls down a hill. Their collective appearance had left on
me an impression of high-born elegance, such as I had never before
received.

I found Adèle peeping through the schoolroom door, which she held ajar.
“What beautiful ladies!” cried she in English. “Oh, I wish I might go
to them! Do you think Mr. Rochester will send for us by-and-bye, after
dinner?”

“No, indeed, I don’t; Mr. Rochester has something else to think about.
Never mind the ladies to-night; perhaps you will see them to-morrow:
here is your dinner.”

She was really hungry, so the chicken and tarts served to divert her
attention for a time. It was well I secured this forage, or both she,
I, and Sophie, to whom I conveyed a share of our repast, would have run
a chance of getting no dinner at all: every one downstairs was too much
engaged to think of us. The dessert was not carried out till after
nine; and at ten footmen were still running to and fro with trays and
coffee-cups. I allowed Adèle to sit up much later than usual; for she
declared she could not possibly go to sleep while the doors kept
opening and shutting below, and people bustling about. Besides, she
added, a message might possibly come from Mr. Rochester when she was
undressed; “et alors quel dommage!”

I told her stories as long as she would listen to them; and then for a
change I took her out into the gallery. The hall lamp was now lit, and
it amused her to look over the balustrade and watch the servants
passing backwards and forwards. When the evening was far advanced, a
sound of music issued from the drawing-room, whither the piano had been
removed; Adèle and I sat down on the top step of the stairs to listen.
Presently a voice blent with the rich tones of the instrument; it was a
lady who sang, and very sweet her notes were. The solo over, a duet
followed, and then a glee: a joyous conversational murmur filled up the
intervals. I listened long: suddenly I discovered that my ear was
wholly intent on analysing the mingled sounds, and trying to
discriminate amidst the confusion of accents those of Mr. Rochester;
and when it caught them, which it soon did, it found a further task in
framing the tones, rendered by distance inarticulate, into words.

The clock struck eleven. I looked at Adèle, whose head leant against my
shoulder; her eyes were waxing heavy, so I took her up in my arms and
carried her off to bed. It was near one before the gentlemen and ladies
sought their chambers.

The next day was as fine as its predecessor: it was devoted by the
party to an excursion to some site in the neighbourhood. They set out
early in the forenoon, some on horseback, the rest in carriages; I
witnessed both the departure and the return. Miss Ingram, as before,
was the only lady equestrian; and, as before, Mr. Rochester galloped at
her side; the two rode a little apart from the rest. I pointed out this
circumstance to Mrs. Fairfax, who was standing at the window with me—

“You said it was not likely they should think of being married,” said
I, “but you see Mr. Rochester evidently prefers her to any of the other
ladies.”

“Yes, I daresay: no doubt he admires her.”

“And she him,” I added; “look how she leans her head towards him as if
she were conversing confidentially; I wish I could see her face; I have
never had a glimpse of it yet.”

“You will see her this evening,” answered Mrs. Fairfax. “I happened to
remark to Mr. Rochester how much Adèle wished to be introduced to the
ladies, and he said: ‘Oh! let her come into the drawing-room after
dinner; and request Miss Eyre to accompany her.’”

“Yes; he said that from mere politeness: I need not go, I am sure,” I
answered.

“Well, I observed to him that as you were unused to company, I did not
think you would like appearing before so gay a party—all strangers; and
he replied, in his quick way—‘Nonsense! If she objects, tell her it is
my particular wish; and if she resists, say I shall come and fetch her
in case of contumacy.’”

“I will not give him that trouble,” I answered. “I will go, if no
better may be; but I don’t like it. Shall you be there, Mrs. Fairfax?”

“No; I pleaded off, and he admitted my plea. I’ll tell you how to
manage so as to avoid the embarrassment of making a formal entrance,
which is the most disagreeable part of the business. You must go into
the drawing-room while it is empty, before the ladies leave the
dinner-table; choose your seat in any quiet nook you like; you need not
stay long after the gentlemen come in, unless you please: just let Mr.
Rochester see you are there and then slip away—nobody will notice you.”

“Will these people remain long, do you think?”

“Perhaps two or three weeks, certainly not more. After the Easter
recess, Sir George Lynn, who was lately elected member for Millcote,
will have to go up to town and take his seat; I daresay Mr. Rochester
will accompany him: it surprises me that he has already made so
protracted a stay at Thornfield.”

It was with some trepidation that I perceived the hour approach when I
was to repair with my charge to the drawing-room. Adèle had been in a
state of ecstasy all day, after hearing she was to be presented to the
ladies in the evening; and it was not till Sophie commenced the
operation of dressing her that she sobered down. Then the importance of
the process quickly steadied her, and by the time she had her curls
arranged in well-smoothed, drooping clusters, her pink satin frock put
on, her long sash tied, and her lace mittens adjusted, she looked as
grave as any judge. No need to warn her not to disarrange her attire:
when she was dressed, she sat demurely down in her little chair, taking
care previously to lift up the satin skirt for fear she should crease
it, and assured me she would not stir thence till I was ready. This I
quickly was: my best dress (the silver-grey one, purchased for Miss
Temple’s wedding, and never worn since) was soon put on; my hair was
soon smoothed; my sole ornament, the pearl brooch, soon assumed. We
descended.

Fortunately there was another entrance to the drawing-room than that
through the saloon where they were all seated at dinner. We found the
apartment vacant; a large fire burning silently on the marble hearth,
and wax candles shining in bright solitude, amid the exquisite flowers
with which the tables were adorned. The crimson curtain hung before the
arch: slight as was the separation this drapery formed from the party
in the adjoining saloon, they spoke in so low a key that nothing of
their conversation could be distinguished beyond a soothing murmur.

Adèle, who appeared to be still under the influence of a most
solemnising impression, sat down, without a word, on the footstool I
pointed out to her. I retired to a window-seat, and taking a book from
a table near, endeavoured to read. Adèle brought her stool to my feet;
ere long she touched my knee.

“What is it, Adèle?”

“Est-ce que je ne puis pas prendre une seule de ces fleurs magnifiques,
mademoiselle? Seulement pour completer ma toilette.”

“You think too much of your ‘toilette,’ Adèle: but you may have a
flower.” And I took a rose from a vase and fastened it in her sash. She
sighed a sigh of ineffable satisfaction, as if her cup of happiness
were now full. I turned my face away to conceal a smile I could not
suppress: there was something ludicrous as well as painful in the
little Parisienne’s earnest and innate devotion to matters of dress.

A soft sound of rising now became audible; the curtain was swept back
from the arch; through it appeared the dining-room, with its lit lustre
pouring down light on the silver and glass of a magnificent
dessert-service covering a long table; a band of ladies stood in the
opening; they entered, and the curtain fell behind them.

There were but eight; yet, somehow, as they flocked in, they gave the
impression of a much larger number. Some of them were very tall; many
were dressed in white; and all had a sweeping amplitude of array that
seemed to magnify their persons as a mist magnifies the moon. I rose
and curtseyed to them: one or two bent their heads in return, the
others only stared at me.

They dispersed about the room, reminding me, by the lightness and
buoyancy of their movements, of a flock of white plumy birds. Some of
them threw themselves in half-reclining positions on the sofas and
ottomans: some bent over the tables and examined the flowers and books:
the rest gathered in a group round the fire: all talked in a low but
clear tone which seemed habitual to them. I knew their names
afterwards, and may as well mention them now.

First, there was Mrs. Eshton and two of her daughters. She had
evidently been a handsome woman, and was well preserved still. Of her
daughters, the eldest, Amy, was rather little: naïve, and child-like in
face and manner, and piquant in form; her white muslin dress and blue
sash became her well. The second, Louisa, was taller and more elegant
in figure; with a very pretty face, of that order the French term
_minois chiffoné_: both sisters were fair as lilies.

Lady Lynn was a large and stout personage of about forty, very erect,
very haughty-looking, richly dressed in a satin robe of changeful
sheen: her dark hair shone glossily under the shade of an azure plume,
and within the circlet of a band of gems.

Mrs. Colonel Dent was less showy; but, I thought, more lady-like. She
had a slight figure, a pale, gentle face, and fair hair. Her black
satin dress, her scarf of rich foreign lace, and her pearl ornaments,
pleased me better than the rainbow radiance of the titled dame.

But the three most distinguished—partly, perhaps, because the tallest
figures of the band—were the Dowager Lady Ingram and her daughters,
Blanche and Mary. They were all three of the loftiest stature of women.
The Dowager might be between forty and fifty: her shape was still fine;
her hair (by candle-light at least) still black; her teeth, too, were
still apparently perfect. Most people would have termed her a splendid
woman of her age: and so she was, no doubt, physically speaking; but
then there was an expression of almost insupportable haughtiness in her
bearing and countenance. She had Roman features and a double chin,
disappearing into a throat like a pillar: these features appeared to me
not only inflated and darkened, but even furrowed with pride; and the
chin was sustained by the same principle, in a position of almost
preternatural erectness. She had, likewise, a fierce and a hard eye: it
reminded me of Mrs. Reed’s; she mouthed her words in speaking; her
voice was deep, its inflections very pompous, very dogmatical,—very
intolerable, in short. A crimson velvet robe, and a shawl turban of
some gold-wrought Indian fabric, invested her (I suppose she thought)
with a truly imperial dignity.

Blanche and Mary were of equal stature,—straight and tall as poplars.
Mary was too slim for her height, but Blanche was moulded like a Dian.
I regarded her, of course, with special interest. First, I wished to
see whether her appearance accorded with Mrs. Fairfax’s description;
secondly, whether it at all resembled the fancy miniature I had painted
of her; and thirdly—it will out!—whether it were such as I should fancy
likely to suit Mr. Rochester’s taste.

As far as person went, she answered point for point, both to my picture
and Mrs. Fairfax’s description. The noble bust, the sloping shoulders,
the graceful neck, the dark eyes and black ringlets were all there;—but
her face? Her face was like her mother’s; a youthful unfurrowed
likeness: the same low brow, the same high features, the same pride. It
was not, however, so saturnine a pride! she laughed continually; her
laugh was satirical, and so was the habitual expression of her arched
and haughty lip.

Genius is said to be self-conscious. I cannot tell whether Miss Ingram
was a genius, but she was self-conscious—remarkably self-conscious
indeed. She entered into a discourse on botany with the gentle Mrs.
Dent. It seemed Mrs. Dent had not studied that science: though, as she
said, she liked flowers, “especially wild ones;” Miss Ingram had, and
she ran over its vocabulary with an air. I presently perceived she was
(what is vernacularly termed) _trailing_ Mrs. Dent; that is, playing on
her ignorance; her _trail_ might be clever, but it was decidedly not
good-natured. She played: her execution was brilliant; she sang: her
voice was fine; she talked French apart to her mamma; and she talked it
well, with fluency and with a good accent.

Mary had a milder and more open countenance than Blanche; softer
features too, and a skin some shades fairer (Miss Ingram was dark as a
Spaniard)—but Mary was deficient in life: her face lacked expression,
her eye lustre; she had nothing to say, and having once taken her seat,
remained fixed like a statue in its niche. The sisters were both
attired in spotless white.

And did I now think Miss Ingram such a choice as Mr. Rochester would be
likely to make? I could not tell—I did not know his taste in female
beauty. If he liked the majestic, she was the very type of majesty:
then she was accomplished, sprightly. Most gentlemen would admire her,
I thought; and that he _did_ admire her, I already seemed to have
obtained proof: to remove the last shade of doubt, it remained but to
see them together.

You are not to suppose, reader, that Adèle has all this time been
sitting motionless on the stool at my feet: no; when the ladies
entered, she rose, advanced to meet them, made a stately reverence, and
said with gravity—

“Bon jour, mesdames.”

And Miss Ingram had looked down at her with a mocking air, and
exclaimed, “Oh, what a little puppet!”

Lady Lynn had remarked, “It is Mr. Rochester’s ward, I suppose—the
little French girl he was speaking of.”

Mrs. Dent had kindly taken her hand, and given her a kiss. Amy and
Louisa Eshton had cried out simultaneously—

“What a love of a child!”

And then they had called her to a sofa, where she now sat, ensconced
between them, chattering alternately in French and broken English;
absorbing not only the young ladies’ attention, but that of Mrs. Eshton
and Lady Lynn, and getting spoilt to her heart’s content.

At last coffee is brought in, and the gentlemen are summoned. I sit in
the shade—if any shade there be in this brilliantly-lit apartment; the
window-curtain half hides me. Again the arch yawns; they come. The
collective appearance of the gentlemen, like that of the ladies, is
very imposing: they are all costumed in black; most of them are tall,
some young. Henry and Frederick Lynn are very dashing sparks indeed;
and Colonel Dent is a fine soldierly man. Mr. Eshton, the magistrate of
the district, is gentleman-like: his hair is quite white, his eyebrows
and whiskers still dark, which gives him something of the appearance of
a “père noble de théâtre.” Lord Ingram, like his sisters, is very tall;
like them, also, he is handsome; but he shares Mary’s apathetic and
listless look: he seems to have more length of limb than vivacity of
blood or vigour of brain.

And where is Mr. Rochester?

He comes in last: I am not looking at the arch, yet I see him enter. I
try to concentrate my attention on those netting-needles, on the meshes
of the purse I am forming—I wish to think only of the work I have in my
hands, to see only the silver beads and silk threads that lie in my
lap; whereas, I distinctly behold his figure, and I inevitably recall
the moment when I last saw it; just after I had rendered him, what he
deemed, an essential service, and he, holding my hand, and looking down
on my face, surveyed me with eyes that revealed a heart full and eager
to overflow; in whose emotions I had a part. How near had I approached
him at that moment! What had occurred since, calculated to change his
and my relative positions? Yet now, how distant, how far estranged we
were! So far estranged, that I did not expect him to come and speak to
me. I did not wonder, when, without looking at me, he took a seat at
the other side of the room, and began conversing with some of the
ladies.

No sooner did I see that his attention was riveted on them, and that I
might gaze without being observed, than my eyes were drawn
involuntarily to his face; I could not keep their lids under control:
they would rise, and the irids would fix on him. I looked, and had an
acute pleasure in looking,—a precious yet poignant pleasure; pure gold,
with a steely point of agony: a pleasure like what the thirst-perishing
man might feel who knows the well to which he has crept is poisoned,
yet stoops and drinks divine draughts nevertheless.

Most true is it that “beauty is in the eye of the gazer.” My master’s
colourless, olive face, square, massive brow, broad and jetty eyebrows,
deep eyes, strong features, firm, grim mouth,—all energy, decision,
will,—were not beautiful, according to rule; but they were more than
beautiful to me; they were full of an interest, an influence that quite
mastered me,—that took my feelings from my own power and fettered them
in his. I had not intended to love him; the reader knows I had wrought
hard to extirpate from my soul the germs of love there detected; and
now, at the first renewed view of him, they spontaneously arrived,
green and strong! He made me love him without looking at me.

I compared him with his guests. What was the gallant grace of the
Lynns, the languid elegance of Lord Ingram,—even the military
distinction of Colonel Dent, contrasted with his look of native pith
and genuine power? I had no sympathy in their appearance, their
expression: yet I could imagine that most observers would call them
attractive, handsome, imposing; while they would pronounce Mr.
Rochester at once harsh-featured and melancholy-looking. I saw them
smile, laugh—it was nothing; the light of the candles had as much soul
in it as their smile; the tinkle of the bell as much significance as
their laugh. I saw Mr. Rochester smile:—his stern features softened;
his eye grew both brilliant and gentle, its ray both searching and
sweet. He was talking, at the moment, to Louisa and Amy Eshton. I
wondered to see them receive with calm that look which seemed to me so
penetrating: I expected their eyes to fall, their colour to rise under
it; yet I was glad when I found they were in no sense moved. “He is not
to them what he is to me,” I thought: “he is not of their kind. I
believe he is of mine;—I am sure he is—I feel akin to him—I understand
the language of his countenance and movements: though rank and wealth
sever us widely, I have something in my brain and heart, in my blood
and nerves, that assimilates me mentally to him. Did I say, a few days
since, that I had nothing to do with him but to receive my salary at
his hands? Did I forbid myself to think of him in any other light than
as a paymaster? Blasphemy against nature! Every good, true, vigorous
feeling I have gathers impulsively round him. I know I must conceal my
sentiments: I must smother hope; I must remember that he cannot care
much for me. For when I say that I am of his kind, I do not mean that I
have his force to influence, and his spell to attract; I mean only that
I have certain tastes and feelings in common with him. I must, then,
repeat continually that we are for ever sundered:—and yet, while I
breathe and think, I must love him.”

Coffee is handed. The ladies, since the gentlemen entered, have become
lively as larks; conversation waxes brisk and merry. Colonel Dent and
Mr. Eshton argue on politics; their wives listen. The two proud
dowagers, Lady Lynn and Lady Ingram, confabulate together. Sir
George—whom, by-the-bye, I have forgotten to describe,—a very big, and
very fresh-looking country gentleman, stands before their sofa,
coffee-cup in hand, and occasionally puts in a word. Mr. Frederick Lynn
has taken a seat beside Mary Ingram, and is showing her the engravings
of a splendid volume: she looks, smiles now and then, but apparently
says little. The tall and phlegmatic Lord Ingram leans with folded arms
on the chair-back of the little and lively Amy Eshton; she glances up
at him, and chatters like a wren: she likes him better than she does
Mr. Rochester. Henry Lynn has taken possession of an ottoman at the
feet of Louisa: Adèle shares it with him: he is trying to talk French
with her, and Louisa laughs at his blunders. With whom will Blanche
Ingram pair? She is standing alone at the table, bending gracefully
over an album. She seems waiting to be sought; but she will not wait
too long: she herself selects a mate.

Mr. Rochester, having quitted the Eshtons, stands on the hearth as
solitary as she stands by the table: she confronts him, taking her
station on the opposite side of the mantelpiece.

“Mr. Rochester, I thought you were not fond of children?”

“Nor am I.”

“Then, what induced you to take charge of such a little doll as that?”
(pointing to Adèle). “Where did you pick her up?”

“I did not pick her up; she was left on my hands.”

“You should have sent her to school.”

“I could not afford it: schools are so dear.”

“Why, I suppose you have a governess for her: I saw a person with her
just now—is she gone? Oh, no! there she is still, behind the
window-curtain. You pay her, of course; I should think it quite as
expensive,—more so; for you have them both to keep in addition.”

I feared—or should I say, hoped?—the allusion to me would make Mr.
Rochester glance my way; and I involuntarily shrank farther into the
shade: but he never turned his eyes.

“I have not considered the subject,” said he indifferently, looking
straight before him.

“No, you men never do consider economy and common sense. You should
hear mama on the chapter of governesses: Mary and I have had, I should
think, a dozen at least in our day; half of them detestable and the
rest ridiculous, and all incubi—were they not, mama?”

“Did you speak, my own?”

The young lady thus claimed as the dowager’s special property,
reiterated her question with an explanation.

“My dearest, don’t mention governesses; the word makes me nervous. I
have suffered a martyrdom from their incompetency and caprice. I thank
Heaven I have now done with them!”

Mrs. Dent here bent over to the pious lady and whispered something in
her ear; I suppose, from the answer elicited, it was a reminder that
one of the anathematised race was present.

“Tant pis!” said her Ladyship, “I hope it may do her good!” Then, in a
lower tone, but still loud enough for me to hear, “I noticed her; I am
a judge of physiognomy, and in hers I see all the faults of her class.”

“What are they, madam?” inquired Mr. Rochester aloud.

“I will tell you in your private ear,” replied she, wagging her turban
three times with portentous significancy.

“But my curiosity will be past its appetite; it craves food now.”

“Ask Blanche; she is nearer you than I.”

“Oh, don’t refer him to me, mama! I have just one word to say of the
whole tribe; they are a nuisance. Not that I ever suffered much from
them; I took care to turn the tables. What tricks Theodore and I used
to play on our Miss Wilsons, and Mrs. Greys, and Madame Jouberts! Mary
was always too sleepy to join in a plot with spirit. The best fun was
with Madame Joubert: Miss Wilson was a poor sickly thing, lachrymose
and low-spirited, not worth the trouble of vanquishing, in short; and
Mrs. Grey was coarse and insensible; no blow took effect on her. But
poor Madame Joubert! I see her yet in her raging passions, when we had
driven her to extremities—spilt our tea, crumbled our bread and butter,
tossed our books up to the ceiling, and played a charivari with the
ruler and desk, the fender and fire-irons. Theodore, do you remember
those merry days?”

“Yaas, to be sure I do,” drawled Lord Ingram; “and the poor old stick
used to cry out ‘Oh you villains childs!’—and then we sermonised her on
the presumption of attempting to teach such clever blades as we were,
when she was herself so ignorant.”

“We did; and, Tedo, you know, I helped you in prosecuting (or
persecuting) your tutor, whey-faced Mr. Vining—the parson in the pip,
as we used to call him. He and Miss Wilson took the liberty of falling
in love with each other—at least Tedo and I thought so; we surprised
sundry tender glances and sighs which we interpreted as tokens of ‘la
belle passion,’ and I promise you the public soon had the benefit of
our discovery; we employed it as a sort of lever to hoist our
dead-weights from the house. Dear mama, there, as soon as she got an
inkling of the business, found out that it was of an immoral tendency.
Did you not, my lady-mother?”

“Certainly, my best. And I was quite right: depend on that: there are a
thousand reasons why liaisons between governesses and tutors should
never be tolerated a moment in any well-regulated house; firstly—”

“Oh, gracious, mama! Spare us the enumeration! _Au reste_, we all know
them: danger of bad example to innocence of childhood; distractions and
consequent neglect of duty on the part of the attached—mutual alliance
and reliance; confidence thence resulting—insolence accompanying—mutiny
and general blow-up. Am I right, Baroness Ingram, of Ingram Park?”

“My lily-flower, you are right now, as always.”

“Then no more need be said: change the subject.”

Amy Eshton, not hearing or not heeding this dictum, joined in with her
soft, infantine tone: “Louisa and I used to quiz our governess too; but
she was such a good creature, she would bear anything: nothing put her
out. She was never cross with us; was she, Louisa?”

“No, never: we might do what we pleased; ransack her desk and her
workbox, and turn her drawers inside out; and she was so good-natured,
she would give us anything we asked for.”

“I suppose, now,” said Miss Ingram, curling her lip sarcastically, “we
shall have an abstract of the memoirs of all the governesses extant: in
order to avert such a visitation, I again move the introduction of a
new topic. Mr. Rochester, do you second my motion?”

“Madam, I support you on this point, as on every other.”

“Then on me be the onus of bringing it forward. Signior Eduardo, are
you in voice to-night?”

“Donna Bianca, if you command it, I will be.”

“Then, signior, I lay on you my sovereign behest to furbish up your
lungs and other vocal organs, as they will be wanted on my royal
service.”

“Who would not be the Rizzio of so divine a Mary?”

“A fig for Rizzio!” cried she, tossing her head with all its curls, as
she moved to the piano. “It is my opinion the fiddler David must have
been an insipid sort of fellow; I like black Bothwell better: to my
mind a man is nothing without a spice of the devil in him; and history
may say what it will of James Hepburn, but I have a notion, he was just
the sort of wild, fierce, bandit hero whom I could have consented to
gift with my hand.”

“Gentlemen, you hear! Now which of you most resembles Bothwell?” cried
Mr. Rochester.

“I should say the preference lies with you,” responded Colonel Dent.

“On my honour, I am much obliged to you,” was the reply.

Miss Ingram, who had now seated herself with proud grace at the piano,
spreading out her snowy robes in queenly amplitude, commenced a
brilliant prelude; talking meantime. She appeared to be on her high
horse to-night; both her words and her air seemed intended to excite
not only the admiration, but the amazement of her auditors: she was
evidently bent on striking them as something very dashing and daring
indeed.

“Oh, I am so sick of the young men of the present day!” exclaimed she,
rattling away at the instrument. “Poor, puny things, not fit to stir a
step beyond papa’s park gates: nor to go even so far without mama’s
permission and guardianship! Creatures so absorbed in care about their
pretty faces, and their white hands, and their small feet; as if a man
had anything to do with beauty! As if loveliness were not the special
prerogative of woman—her legitimate appanage and heritage! I grant an
ugly _woman_ is a blot on the fair face of creation; but as to the
_gentlemen_, let them be solicitous to possess only strength and
valour: let their motto be:—Hunt, shoot, and fight: the rest is not
worth a fillip. Such should be my device, were I a man.”

“Whenever I marry,” she continued after a pause which none interrupted,
“I am resolved my husband shall not be a rival, but a foil to me. I
will suffer no competitor near the throne; I shall exact an undivided
homage: his devotions shall not be shared between me and the shape he
sees in his mirror. Mr. Rochester, now sing, and I will play for you.”

“I am all obedience,” was the response.

“Here then is a Corsair-song. Know that I doat on Corsairs; and for
that reason, sing it _con spirito_.”

“Commands from Miss Ingram’s lips would put spirit into a mug of milk
and water.”

“Take care, then: if you don’t please me, I will shame you by showing
how such things _should_ be done.”

“That is offering a premium on incapacity: I shall now endeavour to
fail.”

“Gardez-vous en bien! If you err wilfully, I shall devise a
proportionate punishment.”

“Miss Ingram ought to be clement, for she has it in her power to
inflict a chastisement beyond mortal endurance.”

“Ha! explain!” commanded the lady.

“Pardon me, madam: no need of explanation; your own fine sense must
inform you that one of your frowns would be a sufficient substitute for
capital punishment.”

“Sing!” said she, and again touching the piano, she commenced an
accompaniment in spirited style.

“Now is my time to slip away,” thought I: but the tones that then
severed the air arrested me. Mrs. Fairfax had said Mr. Rochester
possessed a fine voice: he did—a mellow, powerful bass, into which he
threw his own feeling, his own force; finding a way through the ear to
the heart, and there waking sensation strangely. I waited till the last
deep and full vibration had expired—till the tide of talk, checked an
instant, had resumed its flow; I then quitted my sheltered corner and
made my exit by the side-door, which was fortunately near. Thence a
narrow passage led into the hall: in crossing it, I perceived my sandal
was loose; I stopped to tie it, kneeling down for that purpose on the
mat at the foot of the staircase. I heard the dining-room door unclose;
a gentleman came out; rising hastily, I stood face to face with him: it
was Mr. Rochester.

“How do you do?” he asked.

“I am very well, sir.”

“Why did you not come and speak to me in the room?”

I thought I might have retorted the question on him who put it: but I
would not take that freedom. I answered—

“I did not wish to disturb you, as you seemed engaged, sir.”

“What have you been doing during my absence?”

“Nothing particular; teaching Adèle as usual.”

“And getting a good deal paler than you were—as I saw at first sight.
What is the matter?”

“Nothing at all, sir.”

“Did you take any cold that night you half drowned me?”

“Not the least.”

“Return to the drawing-room: you are deserting too early.”

“I am tired, sir.”

He looked at me for a minute.

“And a little depressed,” he said. “What about? Tell me.”

“Nothing—nothing, sir. I am not depressed.”

“But I affirm that you are: so much depressed that a few more words
would bring tears to your eyes—indeed, they are there now, shining and
swimming; and a bead has slipped from the lash and fallen on to the
flag. If I had time, and was not in mortal dread of some prating prig
of a servant passing, I would know what all this means. Well, to-night
I excuse you; but understand that so long as my visitors stay, I expect
you to appear in the drawing-room every evening; it is my wish; don’t
neglect it. Now go, and send Sophie for Adèle. Good-night, my—” He
stopped, bit his lip, and abruptly left me.




CHAPTER XVIII


Merry days were these at Thornfield Hall; and busy days too: how
different from the first three months of stillness, monotony, and
solitude I had passed beneath its roof! All sad feelings seemed now
driven from the house, all gloomy associations forgotten: there was
life everywhere, movement all day long. You could not now traverse the
gallery, once so hushed, nor enter the front chambers, once so
tenantless, without encountering a smart lady’s-maid or a dandy valet.

The kitchen, the butler’s pantry, the servants’ hall, the entrance
hall, were equally alive; and the saloons were only left void and still
when the blue sky and halcyon sunshine of the genial spring weather
called their occupants out into the grounds. Even when that weather was
broken, and continuous rain set in for some days, no damp seemed cast
over enjoyment: indoor amusements only became more lively and varied,
in consequence of the stop put to outdoor gaiety.

I wondered what they were going to do the first evening a change of
entertainment was proposed: they spoke of “playing charades,” but in my
ignorance I did not understand the term. The servants were called in,
the dining-room tables wheeled away, the lights otherwise disposed, the
chairs placed in a semicircle opposite the arch. While Mr. Rochester
and the other gentlemen directed these alterations, the ladies were
running up and down stairs ringing for their maids. Mrs. Fairfax was
summoned to give information respecting the resources of the house in
shawls, dresses, draperies of any kind; and certain wardrobes of the
third storey were ransacked, and their contents, in the shape of
brocaded and hooped petticoats, satin sacques, black modes, lace
lappets, &c., were brought down in armfuls by the abigails; then a
selection was made, and such things as were chosen were carried to the
boudoir within the drawing-room.

Meantime, Mr. Rochester had again summoned the ladies round him, and
was selecting certain of their number to be of his party. “Miss Ingram
is mine, of course,” said he: afterwards he named the two Misses
Eshton, and Mrs. Dent. He looked at me: I happened to be near him, as I
had been fastening the clasp of Mrs. Dent’s bracelet, which had got
loose.

“Will you play?” he asked. I shook my head. He did not insist, which I
rather feared he would have done; he allowed me to return quietly to my
usual seat.

He and his aids now withdrew behind the curtain: the other party, which
was headed by Colonel Dent, sat down on the crescent of chairs. One of
the gentlemen, Mr. Eshton, observing me, seemed to propose that I
should be asked to join them; but Lady Ingram instantly negatived the
notion.

“No,” I heard her say: “she looks too stupid for any game of the sort.”

Ere long a bell tinkled, and the curtain drew up. Within the arch, the
bulky figure of Sir George Lynn, whom Mr. Rochester had likewise
chosen, was seen enveloped in a white sheet: before him, on a table,
lay open a large book; and at his side stood Amy Eshton, draped in Mr.
Rochester’s cloak, and holding a book in her hand. Somebody, unseen,
rang the bell merrily; then Adèle (who had insisted on being one of her
guardian’s party), bounded forward, scattering round her the contents
of a basket of flowers she carried on her arm. Then appeared the
magnificent figure of Miss Ingram, clad in white, a long veil on her
head, and a wreath of roses round her brow; by her side walked Mr.
Rochester, and together they drew near the table. They knelt; while
Mrs. Dent and Louisa Eshton, dressed also in white, took up their
stations behind them. A ceremony followed, in dumb show, in which it
was easy to recognise the pantomime of a marriage. At its termination,
Colonel Dent and his party consulted in whispers for two minutes, then
the Colonel called out—

“Bride!” Mr. Rochester bowed, and the curtain fell.

A considerable interval elapsed before it again rose. Its second rising
displayed a more elaborately prepared scene than the last. The
drawing-room, as I have before observed, was raised two steps above the
dining-room, and on the top of the upper step, placed a yard or two
back within the room, appeared a large marble basin, which I recognised
as an ornament of the conservatory—where it usually stood, surrounded
by exotics, and tenanted by gold fish—and whence it must have been
transported with some trouble, on account of its size and weight.

Seated on the carpet, by the side of this basin, was seen Mr.
Rochester, costumed in shawls, with a turban on his head. His dark eyes
and swarthy skin and Paynim features suited the costume exactly: he
looked the very model of an Eastern emir, an agent or a victim of the
bowstring. Presently advanced into view Miss Ingram. She, too, was
attired in oriental fashion: a crimson scarf tied sash-like round the
waist: an embroidered handkerchief knotted about her temples; her
beautifully-moulded arms bare, one of them upraised in the act of
supporting a pitcher, poised gracefully on her head. Both her cast of
form and feature, her complexion and her general air, suggested the
idea of some Israelitish princess of the patriarchal days; and such was
doubtless the character she intended to represent.

She approached the basin, and bent over it as if to fill her pitcher;
she again lifted it to her head. The personage on the well-brink now
seemed to accost her; to make some request:—“She hasted, let down her
pitcher on her hand, and gave him to drink.” From the bosom of his robe
he then produced a casket, opened it and showed magnificent bracelets
and earrings; she acted astonishment and admiration; kneeling, he laid
the treasure at her feet; incredulity and delight were expressed by her
looks and gestures; the stranger fastened the bracelets on her arms and
the rings in her ears. It was Eliezer and Rebecca: the camels only were
wanting.

The divining party again laid their heads together: apparently they
could not agree about the word or syllable the scene illustrated.
Colonel Dent, their spokesman, demanded “the tableau of the whole;”
whereupon the curtain again descended.

On its third rising only a portion of the drawing-room was disclosed;
the rest being concealed by a screen, hung with some sort of dark and
coarse drapery. The marble basin was removed; in its place, stood a
deal table and a kitchen chair: these objects were visible by a very
dim light proceeding from a horn lantern, the wax candles being all
extinguished.

Amidst this sordid scene, sat a man with his clenched hands resting on
his knees, and his eyes bent on the ground. I knew Mr. Rochester;
though the begrimed face, the disordered dress (his coat hanging loose
from one arm, as if it had been almost torn from his back in a
scuffle), the desperate and scowling countenance, the rough, bristling
hair might well have disguised him. As he moved, a chain clanked; to
his wrists were attached fetters.

“Bridewell!” exclaimed Colonel Dent, and the charade was solved.

A sufficient interval having elapsed for the performers to resume their
ordinary costume, they re-entered the dining-room. Mr. Rochester led in
Miss Ingram; she was complimenting him on his acting.

“Do you know,” said she, “that, of the three characters, I liked you in
the last best? Oh, had you but lived a few years earlier, what a
gallant gentleman-highwayman you would have made!”

“Is all the soot washed from my face?” he asked, turning it towards
her.

“Alas! yes: the more’s the pity! Nothing could be more becoming to your
complexion than that ruffian’s rouge.”

“You would like a hero of the road then?”

“An English hero of the road would be the next best thing to an Italian
bandit; and that could only be surpassed by a Levantine pirate.”

“Well, whatever I am, remember you are my wife; we were married an hour
since, in the presence of all these witnesses.” She giggled, and her
colour rose.

“Now, Dent,” continued Mr. Rochester, “it is your turn.” And as the
other party withdrew, he and his band took the vacated seats. Miss
Ingram placed herself at her leader’s right hand; the other diviners
filled the chairs on each side of him and her. I did not now watch the
actors; I no longer waited with interest for the curtain to rise; my
attention was absorbed by the spectators; my eyes, erewhile fixed on
the arch, were now irresistibly attracted to the semicircle of chairs.
What charade Colonel Dent and his party played, what word they chose,
how they acquitted themselves, I no longer remember; but I still see
the consultation which followed each scene: I see Mr. Rochester turn to
Miss Ingram, and Miss Ingram to him; I see her incline her head towards
him, till the jetty curls almost touch his shoulder and wave against
his cheek; I hear their mutual whisperings; I recall their interchanged
glances; and something even of the feeling roused by the spectacle
returns in memory at this moment.

I have told you, reader, that I had learnt to love Mr. Rochester: I
could not unlove him now, merely because I found that he had ceased to
notice me—because I might pass hours in his presence, and he would
never once turn his eyes in my direction—because I saw all his
attentions appropriated by a great lady, who scorned to touch me with
the hem of her robes as she passed; who, if ever her dark and imperious
eye fell on me by chance, would withdraw it instantly as from an object
too mean to merit observation. I could not unlove him, because I felt
sure he would soon marry this very lady—because I read daily in her a
proud security in his intentions respecting her—because I witnessed
hourly in him a style of courtship which, if careless and choosing
rather to be sought than to seek, was yet, in its very carelessness,
captivating, and in its very pride, irresistible.

There was nothing to cool or banish love in these circumstances, though
much to create despair. Much too, you will think, reader, to engender
jealousy: if a woman, in my position, could presume to be jealous of a
woman in Miss Ingram’s. But I was not jealous: or very rarely;—the
nature of the pain I suffered could not be explained by that word. Miss
Ingram was a mark beneath jealousy: she was too inferior to excite the
feeling. Pardon the seeming paradox; I mean what I say. She was very
showy, but she was not genuine: she had a fine person, many brilliant
attainments; but her mind was poor, her heart barren by nature: nothing
bloomed spontaneously on that soil; no unforced natural fruit delighted
by its freshness. She was not good; she was not original: she used to
repeat sounding phrases from books: she never offered, nor had, an
opinion of her own. She advocated a high tone of sentiment; but she did
not know the sensations of sympathy and pity; tenderness and truth were
not in her. Too often she betrayed this, by the undue vent she gave to
a spiteful antipathy she had conceived against little Adèle: pushing
her away with some contumelious epithet if she happened to approach
her; sometimes ordering her from the room, and always treating her with
coldness and acrimony. Other eyes besides mine watched these
manifestations of character—watched them closely, keenly, shrewdly.
Yes; the future bridegroom, Mr. Rochester himself, exercised over his
intended a ceaseless surveillance; and it was from this sagacity—this
guardedness of his—this perfect, clear consciousness of his fair one’s
defects—this obvious absence of passion in his sentiments towards her,
that my ever-torturing pain arose.

I saw he was going to marry her, for family, perhaps political reasons,
because her rank and connections suited him; I felt he had not given
her his love, and that her qualifications were ill adapted to win from
him that treasure. This was the point—this was where the nerve was
touched and teased—this was where the fever was sustained and fed: _she
could not charm him_.

If she had managed the victory at once, and he had yielded and
sincerely laid his heart at her feet, I should have covered my face,
turned to the wall, and (figuratively) have died to them. If Miss
Ingram had been a good and noble woman, endowed with force, fervour,
kindness, sense, I should have had one vital struggle with two
tigers—jealousy and despair: then, my heart torn out and devoured, I
should have admired her—acknowledged her excellence, and been quiet for
the rest of my days: and the more absolute her superiority, the deeper
would have been my admiration—the more truly tranquil my quiescence.
But as matters really stood, to watch Miss Ingram’s efforts at
fascinating Mr. Rochester, to witness their repeated failure—herself
unconscious that they did fail; vainly fancying that each shaft
launched hit the mark, and infatuatedly pluming herself on success,
when her pride and self-complacency repelled further and further what
she wished to allure—to witness _this_, was to be at once under
ceaseless excitation and ruthless restraint.

Because, when she failed, I saw how she might have succeeded. Arrows
that continually glanced off from Mr. Rochester’s breast and fell
harmless at his feet, might, I knew, if shot by a surer hand, have
quivered keen in his proud heart—have called love into his stern eye,
and softness into his sardonic face; or, better still, without weapons
a silent conquest might have been won.

“Why can she not influence him more, when she is privileged to draw so
near to him?” I asked myself. “Surely she cannot truly like him, or not
like him with true affection! If she did, she need not coin her smiles
so lavishly, flash her glances so unremittingly, manufacture airs so
elaborate, graces so multitudinous. It seems to me that she might, by
merely sitting quietly at his side, saying little and looking less, get
nigher his heart. I have seen in his face a far different expression
from that which hardens it now while she is so vivaciously accosting
him; but then it came of itself: it was not elicited by meretricious
arts and calculated manoeuvres; and one had but to accept it—to answer
what he asked without pretension, to address him when needful without
grimace—and it increased and grew kinder and more genial, and warmed
one like a fostering sunbeam. How will she manage to please him when
they are married? I do not think she will manage it; and yet it might
be managed; and his wife might, I verily believe, be the very happiest
woman the sun shines on.”

I have not yet said anything condemnatory of Mr. Rochester’s project of
marrying for interest and connections. It surprised me when I first
discovered that such was his intention: I had thought him a man
unlikely to be influenced by motives so commonplace in his choice of a
wife; but the longer I considered the position, education, &c., of the
parties, the less I felt justified in judging and blaming either him or
Miss Ingram for acting in conformity to ideas and principles instilled
into them, doubtless, from their childhood. All their class held these
principles: I supposed, then, they had reasons for holding them such as
I could not fathom. It seemed to me that, were I a gentleman like him,
I would take to my bosom only such a wife as I could love; but the very
obviousness of the advantages to the husband’s own happiness offered by
this plan convinced me that there must be arguments against its general
adoption of which I was quite ignorant: otherwise I felt sure all the
world would act as I wished to act.

But in other points, as well as this, I was growing very lenient to my
master: I was forgetting all his faults, for which I had once kept a
sharp look-out. It had formerly been my endeavour to study all sides of
his character: to take the bad with the good; and from the just
weighing of both, to form an equitable judgment. Now I saw no bad. The
sarcasm that had repelled, the harshness that had startled me once,
were only like keen condiments in a choice dish: their presence was
pungent, but their absence would be felt as comparatively insipid. And
as for the vague something—was it a sinister or a sorrowful, a
designing or a desponding expression?—that opened upon a careful
observer, now and then, in his eye, and closed again before one could
fathom the strange depth partially disclosed; that something which used
to make me fear and shrink, as if I had been wandering amongst
volcanic-looking hills, and had suddenly felt the ground quiver and
seen it gape: that something, I, at intervals, beheld still; and with
throbbing heart, but not with palsied nerves. Instead of wishing to
shun, I longed only to dare—to divine it; and I thought Miss Ingram
happy, because one day she might look into the abyss at her leisure,
explore its secrets and analyse their nature.

Meantime, while I thought only of my master and his future bride—saw
only them, heard only their discourse, and considered only their
movements of importance—the rest of the party were occupied with their
own separate interests and pleasures. The Ladies Lynn and Ingram
continued to consort in solemn conferences, where they nodded their two
turbans at each other, and held up their four hands in confronting
gestures of surprise, or mystery, or horror, according to the theme on
which their gossip ran, like a pair of magnified puppets. Mild Mrs.
Dent talked with good-natured Mrs. Eshton; and the two sometimes
bestowed a courteous word or smile on me. Sir George Lynn, Colonel
Dent, and Mr. Eshton discussed politics, or county affairs, or justice
business. Lord Ingram flirted with Amy Eshton; Louisa played and sang
to and with one of the Messrs. Lynn; and Mary Ingram listened languidly
to the gallant speeches of the other. Sometimes all, as with one
consent, suspended their by-play to observe and listen to the principal
actors: for, after all, Mr. Rochester and—because closely connected
with him—Miss Ingram were the life and soul of the party. If he was
absent from the room an hour, a perceptible dulness seemed to steal
over the spirits of his guests; and his re-entrance was sure to give a
fresh impulse to the vivacity of conversation.

The want of his animating influence appeared to be peculiarly felt one
day that he had been summoned to Millcote on business, and was not
likely to return till late. The afternoon was wet: a walk the party had
proposed to take to see a gipsy camp, lately pitched on a common beyond
Hay, was consequently deferred. Some of the gentlemen were gone to the
stables: the younger ones, together with the younger ladies, were
playing billiards in the billiard-room. The dowagers Ingram and Lynn
sought solace in a quiet game at cards. Blanche Ingram, after having
repelled, by supercilious taciturnity, some efforts of Mrs. Dent and
Mrs. Eshton to draw her into conversation, had first murmured over some
sentimental tunes and airs on the piano, and then, having fetched a
novel from the library, had flung herself in haughty listlessness on a
sofa, and prepared to beguile, by the spell of fiction, the tedious
hours of absence. The room and the house were silent: only now and then
the merriment of the billiard-players was heard from above.

It was verging on dusk, and the clock had already given warning of the
hour to dress for dinner, when little Adèle, who knelt by me in the
drawing-room window-seat, suddenly exclaimed—

“Voilà Monsieur Rochester, qui revient!”

I turned, and Miss Ingram darted forwards from her sofa: the others,
too, looked up from their several occupations; for at the same time a
crunching of wheels and a splashing tramp of horse-hoofs became audible
on the wet gravel. A post-chaise was approaching.

“What can possess him to come home in that style?” said Miss Ingram.
“He rode Mesrour (the black horse), did he not, when he went out? and
Pilot was with him:—what has he done with the animals?”

As she said this, she approached her tall person and ample garments so
near the window, that I was obliged to bend back almost to the breaking
of my spine: in her eagerness she did not observe me at first, but when
she did, she curled her lip and moved to another casement. The
post-chaise stopped; the driver rang the door-bell, and a gentleman
alighted attired in travelling garb; but it was not Mr. Rochester; it
was a tall, fashionable-looking man, a stranger.

“How provoking!” exclaimed Miss Ingram: “you tiresome monkey!”
(apostrophising Adèle), “who perched you up in the window to give false
intelligence?” and she cast on me an angry glance, as if I were in
fault.

Some parleying was audible in the hall, and soon the new-comer entered.
He bowed to Lady Ingram, as deeming her the eldest lady present.

“It appears I come at an inopportune time, madam,” said he, “when my
friend, Mr. Rochester, is from home; but I arrive from a very long
journey, and I think I may presume so far on old and intimate
acquaintance as to instal myself here till he returns.”

His manner was polite; his accent, in speaking, struck me as being
somewhat unusual,—not precisely foreign, but still not altogether
English: his age might be about Mr. Rochester’s,—between thirty and
forty; his complexion was singularly sallow: otherwise he was a
fine-looking man, at first sight especially. On closer examination, you
detected something in his face that displeased, or rather that failed
to please. His features were regular, but too relaxed: his eye was
large and well cut, but the life looking out of it was a tame, vacant
life—at least so I thought.

The sound of the dressing-bell dispersed the party. It was not till
after dinner that I saw him again: he then seemed quite at his ease.
But I liked his physiognomy even less than before: it struck me as
being at the same time unsettled and inanimate. His eye wandered, and
had no meaning in its wandering: this gave him an odd look, such as I
never remembered to have seen. For a handsome and not an
unamiable-looking man, he repelled me exceedingly: there was no power
in that smooth-skinned face of a full oval shape: no firmness in that
aquiline nose and small cherry mouth; there was no thought on the low,
even forehead; no command in that blank, brown eye.

As I sat in my usual nook, and looked at him with the light of the
girandoles on the mantelpiece beaming full over him—for he occupied an
arm-chair drawn close to the fire, and kept shrinking still nearer, as
if he were cold, I compared him with Mr. Rochester. I think (with
deference be it spoken) the contrast could not be much greater between
a sleek gander and a fierce falcon: between a meek sheep and the
rough-coated keen-eyed dog, its guardian.

He had spoken of Mr. Rochester as an old friend. A curious friendship
theirs must have been: a pointed illustration, indeed, of the old adage
that “extremes meet.”

Two or three of the gentlemen sat near him, and I caught at times
scraps of their conversation across the room. At first I could not make
much sense of what I heard; for the discourse of Louisa Eshton and Mary
Ingram, who sat nearer to me, confused the fragmentary sentences that
reached me at intervals. These last were discussing the stranger; they
both called him “a beautiful man.” Louisa said he was “a love of a
creature,” and she “adored him;” and Mary instanced his “pretty little
mouth, and nice nose,” as her ideal of the charming.

“And what a sweet-tempered forehead he has!” cried Louisa,—“so
smooth—none of those frowning irregularities I dislike so much; and
such a placid eye and smile!”

And then, to my great relief, Mr. Henry Lynn summoned them to the other
side of the room, to settle some point about the deferred excursion to
Hay Common.

I was now able to concentrate my attention on the group by the fire,
and I presently gathered that the new-comer was called Mr. Mason; then
I learned that he was but just arrived in England, and that he came
from some hot country: which was the reason, doubtless, his face was so
sallow, and that he sat so near the hearth, and wore a surtout in the
house. Presently the words Jamaica, Kingston, Spanish Town, indicated
the West Indies as his residence; and it was with no little surprise I
gathered, ere long, that he had there first seen and become acquainted
with Mr. Rochester. He spoke of his friend’s dislike of the burning
heats, the hurricanes, and rainy seasons of that region. I knew Mr.
Rochester had been a traveller: Mrs. Fairfax had said so; but I thought
the continent of Europe had bounded his wanderings; till now I had
never heard a hint given of visits to more distant shores.

I was pondering these things, when an incident, and a somewhat
unexpected one, broke the thread of my musings. Mr. Mason, shivering as
some one chanced to open the door, asked for more coal to be put on the
fire, which had burnt out its flame, though its mass of cinder still
shone hot and red. The footman who brought the coal, in going out,
stopped near Mr. Eshton’s chair, and said something to him in a low
voice, of which I heard only the words, “old woman,”—“quite
troublesome.”

“Tell her she shall be put in the stocks if she does not take herself
off,” replied the magistrate.

“No—stop!” interrupted Colonel Dent. “Don’t send her away, Eshton; we
might turn the thing to account; better consult the ladies.” And
speaking aloud, he continued—“Ladies, you talked of going to Hay Common
to visit the gipsy camp; Sam here says that one of the old Mother
Bunches is in the servants’ hall at this moment, and insists upon being
brought in before ‘the quality,’ to tell them their fortunes. Would you
like to see her?”

“Surely, colonel,” cried Lady Ingram, “you would not encourage such a
low impostor? Dismiss her, by all means, at once!”

“But I cannot persuade her to go away, my lady,” said the footman; “nor
can any of the servants: Mrs. Fairfax is with her just now, entreating
her to be gone; but she has taken a chair in the chimney-corner, and
says nothing shall stir her from it till she gets leave to come in
here.”

“What does she want?” asked Mrs. Eshton.

“‘To tell the gentry their fortunes,’ she says, ma’am; and she swears
she must and will do it.”

“What is she like?” inquired the Misses Eshton, in a breath.

“A shockingly ugly old creature, miss; almost as black as a crock.”

“Why, she’s a real sorceress!” cried Frederick Lynn. “Let us have her
in, of course.”

“To be sure,” rejoined his brother; “it would be a thousand pities to
throw away such a chance of fun.”

“My dear boys, what are you thinking about?” exclaimed Mrs. Lynn.

“I cannot possibly countenance any such inconsistent proceeding,”
chimed in the Dowager Ingram.

“Indeed, mama, but you can—and will,” pronounced the haughty voice of
Blanche, as she turned round on the piano-stool; where till now she had
sat silent, apparently examining sundry sheets of music. “I have a
curiosity to hear my fortune told: therefore, Sam, order the beldame
forward.”

“My darling Blanche! recollect—”

“I do—I recollect all you can suggest; and I must have my will—quick,
Sam!”

“Yes—yes—yes!” cried all the juveniles, both ladies and gentlemen. “Let
her come—it will be excellent sport!”

The footman still lingered. “She looks such a rough one,” said he.

“Go!” ejaculated Miss Ingram, and the man went.

Excitement instantly seized the whole party: a running fire of raillery
and jests was proceeding when Sam returned.

“She won’t come now,” said he. “She says it’s not her mission to appear
before the ‘vulgar herd’ (them’s her words). I must show her into a
room by herself, and then those who wish to consult her must go to her
one by one.”

“You see now, my queenly Blanche,” began Lady Ingram, “she encroaches.
Be advised, my angel girl—and—”

“Show her into the library, of course,” cut in the “angel girl.” “It is
not my mission to listen to her before the vulgar herd either: I mean
to have her all to myself. Is there a fire in the library?”

“Yes, ma’am—but she looks such a tinkler.”

“Cease that chatter, blockhead! and do my bidding.”

Again Sam vanished; and mystery, animation, expectation rose to full
flow once more.

“She’s ready now,” said the footman, as he reappeared. “She wishes to
know who will be her first visitor.”

“I think I had better just look in upon her before any of the ladies
go,” said Colonel Dent.

“Tell her, Sam, a gentleman is coming.”

Sam went and returned.

“She says, sir, that she’ll have no gentlemen; they need not trouble
themselves to come near her; nor,” he added, with difficulty
suppressing a titter, “any ladies either, except the young, and
single.”

“By Jove, she has taste!” exclaimed Henry Lynn.

Miss Ingram rose solemnly: “I go first,” she said, in a tone which
might have befitted the leader of a forlorn hope, mounting a breach in
the van of his men.

“Oh, my best! oh, my dearest! pause—reflect!” was her mama’s cry; but
she swept past her in stately silence, passed through the door which
Colonel Dent held open, and we heard her enter the library.

A comparative silence ensued. Lady Ingram thought it “le cas” to wring
her hands: which she did accordingly. Miss Mary declared she felt, for
her part, she never dared venture. Amy and Louisa Eshton tittered under
their breath, and looked a little frightened.

The minutes passed very slowly: fifteen were counted before the
library-door again opened. Miss Ingram returned to us through the arch.

Would she laugh? Would she take it as a joke? All eyes met her with a
glance of eager curiosity, and she met all eyes with one of rebuff and
coldness; she looked neither flurried nor merry: she walked stiffly to
her seat, and took it in silence.

“Well, Blanche?” said Lord Ingram.

“What did she say, sister?” asked Mary.

“What did you think? How do you feel? Is she a real fortune-teller?”
demanded the Misses Eshton.

“Now, now, good people,” returned Miss Ingram, “don’t press upon me.
Really your organs of wonder and credulity are easily excited: you
seem, by the importance of you all—my good mama included—ascribe to
this matter, absolutely to believe we have a genuine witch in the
house, who is in close alliance with the old gentleman. I have seen a
gipsy vagabond; she has practised in hackneyed fashion the science of
palmistry and told me what such people usually tell. My whim is
gratified; and now I think Mr. Eshton will do well to put the hag in
the stocks to-morrow morning, as he threatened.”

Miss Ingram took a book, leant back in her chair, and so declined
further conversation. I watched her for nearly half-an-hour: during all
that time she never turned a page, and her face grew momently darker,
more dissatisfied, and more sourly expressive of disappointment. She
had obviously not heard anything to her advantage: and it seemed to me,
from her prolonged fit of gloom and taciturnity, that she herself,
notwithstanding her professed indifference, attached undue importance
to whatever revelations had been made her.


During all that time she never turned a page

Meantime, Mary Ingram, Amy and Louisa Eshton, declared they dared not
go alone; and yet they all wished to go. A negotiation was opened
through the medium of the ambassador, Sam; and after much pacing to and
fro, till, I think, the said Sam’s calves must have ached with the
exercise, permission was at last, with great difficulty, extorted from
the rigorous Sibyl, for the three to wait upon her in a body.

Their visit was not so still as Miss Ingram’s had been: we heard
hysterical giggling and little shrieks proceeding from the library; and
at the end of about twenty minutes they burst the door open, and came
running across the hall, as if they were half-scared out of their wits.

“I am sure she is something not right!” they cried, one and all. “She
told us such things! She knows all about us!” and they sank breathless
into the various seats the gentlemen hastened to bring them.

Pressed for further explanation, they declared she had told them of
things they had said and done when they were mere children; described
books and ornaments they had in their boudoirs at home: keepsakes that
different relations had presented to them. They affirmed that she had
even divined their thoughts, and had whispered in the ear of each the
name of the person she liked best in the world, and informed them of
what they most wished for.

Here the gentlemen interposed with earnest petitions to be further
enlightened on these two last-named points; but they got only blushes,
ejaculations, tremors, and titters, in return for their importunity.
The matrons, meantime, offered vinaigrettes and wielded fans; and again
and again reiterated the expression of their concern that their warning
had not been taken in time; and the elder gentlemen laughed, and the
younger urged their services on the agitated fair ones.

In the midst of the tumult, and while my eyes and ears were fully
engaged in the scene before me, I heard a hem close at my elbow: I
turned, and saw Sam.

“If you please, miss, the gipsy declares that there is another young
single lady in the room who has not been to her yet, and she swears she
will not go till she has seen all. I thought it must be you: there is
no one else for it. What shall I tell her?”

“Oh, I will go by all means,” I answered: and I was glad of the
unexpected opportunity to gratify my much-excited curiosity. I slipped
out of the room, unobserved by any eye—for the company were gathered in
one mass about the trembling trio just returned—and I closed the door
quietly behind me.

“If you like, miss,” said Sam, “I’ll wait in the hall for you; and if
she frightens you, just call and I’ll come in.”

“No, Sam, return to the kitchen: I am not in the least afraid.” Nor was
I; but I was a good deal interested and excited.




CHAPTER XIX


The library looked tranquil enough as I entered it, and the Sibyl—if
Sibyl she were—was seated snugly enough in an easy-chair at the
chimney-corner. She had on a red cloak and a black bonnet: or rather, a
broad-brimmed gipsy hat, tied down with a striped handkerchief under
her chin. An extinguished candle stood on the table; she was bending
over the fire, and seemed reading in a little black book, like a
prayer-book, by the light of the blaze: she muttered the words to
herself, as most old women do, while she read; she did not desist
immediately on my entrance: it appeared she wished to finish a
paragraph.

I stood on the rug and warmed my hands, which were rather cold with
sitting at a distance from the drawing-room fire. I felt now as
composed as ever I did in my life: there was nothing indeed in the
gipsy’s appearance to trouble one’s calm. She shut her book and slowly
looked up; her hat-brim partially shaded her face, yet I could see, as
she raised it, that it was a strange one. It looked all brown and
black: elf-locks bristled out from beneath a white band which passed
under her chin, and came half over her cheeks, or rather jaws: her eye
confronted me at once, with a bold and direct gaze.

“Well, and you want your fortune told?” she said, in a voice as decided
as her glance, as harsh as her features.

“I don’t care about it, mother; you may please yourself: but I ought to
warn you, I have no faith.”

“It’s like your impudence to say so: I expected it of you; I heard it
in your step as you crossed the threshold.”

“Did you? You’ve a quick ear.”

“I have; and a quick eye and a quick brain.”

“You need them all in your trade.”

“I do; especially when I’ve customers like you to deal with. Why don’t
you tremble?”

“I’m not cold.”

“Why don’t you turn pale?”

“I am not sick.”

“Why don’t you consult my art?”

“I’m not silly.”

The old crone “nichered” a laugh under her bonnet and bandage; she then
drew out a short black pipe, and lighting it began to smoke. Having
indulged a while in this sedative, she raised her bent body, took the
pipe from her lips, and while gazing steadily at the fire, said very
deliberately—

“You are cold; you are sick; and you are silly.”

“Prove it,” I rejoined.

“I will, in few words. You are cold, because you are alone: no contact
strikes the fire from you that is in you. You are sick; because the
best of feelings, the highest and the sweetest given to man, keeps far
away from you. You are silly, because, suffer as you may, you will not
beckon it to approach, nor will you stir one step to meet it where it
waits you.”

She again put her short black pipe to her lips, and renewed her smoking
with vigour.

“You might say all that to almost any one who you knew lived as a
solitary dependent in a great house.”

“I might say it to almost any one: but would it be true of almost any
one?”

“In my circumstances.”

“Yes; just so, in _your_ circumstances: but find me another precisely
placed as you are.”

“It would be easy to find you thousands.”

“You could scarcely find me one. If you knew it, you are peculiarly
situated: very near happiness; yes, within reach of it. The materials
are all prepared; there only wants a movement to combine them. Chance
laid them somewhat apart; let them be once approached and bliss
results.”

“I don’t understand enigmas. I never could guess a riddle in my life.”

“If you wish me to speak more plainly, show me your palm.”

“And I must cross it with silver, I suppose?”

“To be sure.”

I gave her a shilling: she put it into an old stocking-foot which she
took out of her pocket, and having tied it round and returned it, she
told me to hold out my hand. I did. She approached her face to the
palm, and pored over it without touching it.

“It is too fine,” said she. “I can make nothing of such a hand as that;
almost without lines: besides, what is in a palm? Destiny is not
written there.”

“I believe you,” said I.

“No,” she continued, “it is in the face: on the forehead, about the
eyes, in the lines of the mouth. Kneel, and lift up your head.”

“Ah! now you are coming to reality,” I said, as I obeyed her. “I shall
begin to put some faith in you presently.”

I knelt within half a yard of her. She stirred the fire, so that a
ripple of light broke from the disturbed coal: the glare, however, as
she sat, only threw her face into deeper shadow: mine, it illumined.

“I wonder with what feelings you came to me to-night,” she said, when
she had examined me a while. “I wonder what thoughts are busy in your
heart during all the hours you sit in yonder room with the fine people
flitting before you like shapes in a magic-lantern: just as little
sympathetic communion passing between you and them as if they were
really mere shadows of human forms, and not the actual substance.”

“I feel tired often, sleepy sometimes, but seldom sad.”

“Then you have some secret hope to buoy you up and please you with
whispers of the future?”

“Not I. The utmost I hope is, to save money enough out of my earnings
to set up a school some day in a little house rented by myself.”

“A mean nutriment for the spirit to exist on: and sitting in that
window-seat (you see I know your habits)—”

“You have learned them from the servants.”

“Ah! you think yourself sharp. Well, perhaps I have: to speak truth, I
have an acquaintance with one of them, Mrs. Poole—”

I started to my feet when I heard the name.

“You have—have you?” thought I; “there is diablerie in the business
after all, then!”

“Don’t be alarmed,” continued the strange being; “she’s a safe hand is
Mrs. Poole: close and quiet; any one may repose confidence in her. But,
as I was saying: sitting in that window-seat, do you think of nothing
but your future school? Have you no present interest in any of the
company who occupy the sofas and chairs before you? Is there not one
face you study? one figure whose movements you follow with at least
curiosity?”

“I like to observe all the faces and all the figures.”

“But do you never single one from the rest—or it may be, two?”

“I do frequently; when the gestures or looks of a pair seem telling a
tale: it amuses me to watch them.”

“What tale do you like best to hear?”

“Oh, I have not much choice! They generally run on the same
theme—courtship; and promise to end in the same catastrophe—marriage.”

“And do you like that monotonous theme?”

“Positively, I don’t care about it: it is nothing to me.”

“Nothing to you? When a lady, young and full of life and health,
charming with beauty and endowed with the gifts of rank and fortune,
sits and smiles in the eyes of a gentleman you—”

“I what?”

“You know—and perhaps think well of.”

“I don’t know the gentlemen here. I have scarcely interchanged a
syllable with one of them; and as to thinking well of them, I consider
some respectable, and stately, and middle-aged, and others young,
dashing, handsome, and lively: but certainly they are all at liberty to
be the recipients of whose smiles they please, without my feeling
disposed to consider the transaction of any moment to me.”

“You don’t know the gentlemen here? You have not exchanged a syllable
with one of them? Will you say that of the master of the house!”

“He is not at home.”

“A profound remark! A most ingenious quibble! He went to Millcote this
morning, and will be back here to-night or to-morrow: does that
circumstance exclude him from the list of your acquaintance—blot him,
as it were, out of existence?”

“No; but I can scarcely see what Mr. Rochester has to do with the theme
you had introduced.”

“I was talking of ladies smiling in the eyes of gentlemen; and of late
so many smiles have been shed into Mr. Rochester’s eyes that they
overflow like two cups filled above the brim: have you never remarked
that?”

“Mr. Rochester has a right to enjoy the society of his guests.”

“No question about his right: but have you never observed that, of all
the tales told here about matrimony, Mr. Rochester has been favoured
with the most lively and the most continuous?”

“The eagerness of a listener quickens the tongue of a narrator.” I said
this rather to myself than to the gipsy, whose strange talk, voice,
manner, had by this time wrapped me in a kind of dream. One unexpected
sentence came from her lips after another, till I got involved in a web
of mystification; and wondered what unseen spirit had been sitting for
weeks by my heart watching its workings and taking record of every
pulse.

“Eagerness of a listener!” repeated she: “yes; Mr. Rochester has sat by
the hour, his ear inclined to the fascinating lips that took such
delight in their task of communicating; and Mr. Rochester was so
willing to receive and looked so grateful for the pastime given him;
you have noticed this?”

“Grateful! I cannot remember detecting gratitude in his face.”

“Detecting! You have analysed, then. And what did you detect, if not
gratitude?”

I said nothing.

“You have seen love: have you not?—and, looking forward, you have seen
him married, and beheld his bride happy?”

“Humph! Not exactly. Your witch’s skill is rather at fault sometimes.”

“What the devil have you seen, then?”

“Never mind: I came here to inquire, not to confess. Is it known that
Mr. Rochester is to be married?”

“Yes; and to the beautiful Miss Ingram.”

“Shortly?”

“Appearances would warrant that conclusion: and, no doubt (though, with
an audacity that wants chastising out of you, you seem to question it),
they will be a superlatively happy pair. He must love such a handsome,
noble, witty, accomplished lady; and probably she loves him, or, if not
his person, at least his purse. I know she considers the Rochester
estate eligible to the last degree; though (God pardon me!) I told her
something on that point about an hour ago which made her look wondrous
grave: the corners of her mouth fell half an inch. I would advise her
blackaviced suitor to look out: if another comes, with a longer or
clearer rent-roll,—he’s dished—”

“But, mother, I did not come to hear Mr. Rochester’s fortune: I came to
hear my own; and you have told me nothing of it.”

“Your fortune is yet doubtful: when I examined your face, one trait
contradicted another. Chance has meted you a measure of happiness: that
I know. I knew it before I came here this evening. She has laid it
carefully on one side for you. I saw her do it. It depends on yourself
to stretch out your hand, and take it up: but whether you will do so,
is the problem I study. Kneel again on the rug.”

“Don’t keep me long; the fire scorches me.”


She did not stoop towards me, but only gazed, leaning back in her chair

I knelt. She did not stoop towards me, but only gazed, leaning back in
her chair. She began muttering,—

“The flame flickers in the eye; the eye shines like dew; it looks soft
and full of feeling; it smiles at my jargon: it is susceptible;
impression follows impression through its clear sphere; where it ceases
to smile, it is sad; an unconscious lassitude weighs on the lid: that
signifies melancholy resulting from loneliness. It turns from me; it
will not suffer further scrutiny; it seems to deny, by a mocking
glance, the truth of the discoveries I have already made,—to disown the
charge both of sensibility and chagrin: its pride and reserve only
confirm me in my opinion. The eye is favourable.

“As to the mouth, it delights at times in laughter; it is disposed to
impart all that the brain conceives; though I daresay it would be
silent on much the heart experiences. Mobile and flexible, it was never
intended to be compressed in the eternal silence of solitude: it is a
mouth which should speak much and smile often, and have human affection
for its interlocutor. That feature too is propitious.

“I see no enemy to a fortunate issue but in the brow; and that brow
professes to say,—‘I can live alone, if self-respect, and circumstances
require me so to do. I need not sell my soul to buy bliss. I have an
inward treasure born with me, which can keep me alive if all extraneous
delights should be withheld, or offered only at a price I cannot afford
to give.’ The forehead declares, ‘Reason sits firm and holds the reins,
and she will not let the feelings burst away and hurry her to wild
chasms. The passions may rage furiously, like true heathens, as they
are; and the desires may imagine all sorts of vain things: but judgment
shall still have the last word in every argument, and the casting vote
in every decision. Strong wind, earthquake-shock, and fire may pass by:
but I shall follow the guiding of that still small voice which
interprets the dictates of conscience.’

“Well said, forehead; your declaration shall be respected. I have
formed my plans—right plans I deem them—and in them I have attended to
the claims of conscience, the counsels of reason. I know how soon youth
would fade and bloom perish, if, in the cup of bliss offered, but one
dreg of shame, or one flavour of remorse were detected; and I do not
want sacrifice, sorrow, dissolution—such is not my taste. I wish to
foster, not to blight—to earn gratitude, not to wring tears of
blood—no, nor of brine: my harvest must be in smiles, in endearments,
in sweet—That will do. I think I rave in a kind of exquisite delirium.
I should wish now to protract this moment _ad infinitum_; but I dare
not. So far I have governed myself thoroughly. I have acted as I
inwardly swore I would act; but further might try me beyond my
strength. Rise, Miss Eyre: leave me; the play is played out’.”

Where was I? Did I wake or sleep? Had I been dreaming? Did I dream
still? The old woman’s voice had changed: her accent, her gesture, and
all were familiar to me as my own face in a glass—as the speech of my
own tongue. I got up, but did not go. I looked; I stirred the fire, and
I looked again: but she drew her bonnet and her bandage closer about
her face, and again beckoned me to depart. The flame illuminated her
hand stretched out: roused now, and on the alert for discoveries, I at
once noticed that hand. It was no more the withered limb of eld than my
own; it was a rounded supple member, with smooth fingers, symmetrically
turned; a broad ring flashed on the little finger, and stooping
forward, I looked at it, and saw a gem I had seen a hundred times
before. Again I looked at the face; which was no longer turned from
me—on the contrary, the bonnet was doffed, the bandage displaced, the
head advanced.

“Well, Jane, do you know me?” asked the familiar voice.

“Only take off the red cloak, sir, and then—”

“But the string is in a knot—help me.”

“Break it, sir.”

“There, then—‘Off, ye lendings!’” And Mr. Rochester stepped out of his
disguise.

“Now, sir, what a strange idea!”

“But well carried out, eh? Don’t you think so?”

“With the ladies you must have managed well.”

“But not with you?”

“You did not act the character of a gipsy with me.”

“What character did I act? My own?”

“No; some unaccountable one. In short, I believe you have been trying
to draw me out—or in; you have been talking nonsense to make me talk
nonsense. It is scarcely fair, sir.”

“Do you forgive me, Jane?”

“I cannot tell till I have thought it all over. If, on reflection, I
find I have fallen into no great absurdity, I shall try to forgive you;
but it was not right.”

“Oh, you have been very correct—very careful, very sensible.”

I reflected, and thought, on the whole, I had. It was a comfort; but,
indeed, I had been on my guard almost from the beginning of the
interview. Something of masquerade I suspected. I knew gipsies and
fortune-tellers did not express themselves as this seeming old woman
had expressed herself; besides I had noted her feigned voice, her
anxiety to conceal her features. But my mind had been running on Grace
Poole—that living enigma, that mystery of mysteries, as I considered
her. I had never thought of Mr. Rochester.

“Well,” said he, “what are you musing about? What does that grave smile
signify?”

“Wonder and self-congratulation, sir. I have your permission to retire
now, I suppose?”

“No; stay a moment; and tell me what the people in the drawing-room
yonder are doing.”

“Discussing the gipsy, I daresay.”

“Sit down!—Let me hear what they said about me.”

“I had better not stay long, sir; it must be near eleven o’clock. Oh,
are you aware, Mr. Rochester, that a stranger has arrived here since
you left this morning?”

“A stranger!—no; who can it be? I expected no one; is he gone?”

“No; he said he had known you long, and that he could take the liberty
of installing himself here till you returned.”

“The devil he did! Did he give his name?”

“His name is Mason, sir; and he comes from the West Indies; from
Spanish Town, in Jamaica, I think.”

Mr. Rochester was standing near me; he had taken my hand, as if to lead
me to a chair. As I spoke he gave my wrist a convulsive grip; the smile
on his lips froze: apparently a spasm caught his breath.

“Mason!—the West Indies!” he said, in the tone one might fancy a
speaking automaton to enounce its single words; “Mason!—the West
Indies!” he reiterated; and he went over the syllables three times,
growing, in the intervals of speaking, whiter than ashes: he hardly
seemed to know what he was doing.

“Do you feel ill, sir?” I inquired.

“Jane, I’ve got a blow; I’ve got a blow, Jane!” He staggered.

“Oh, lean on me, sir.”

“Jane, you offered me your shoulder once before; let me have it now.”

“Yes, sir, yes; and my arm.”

He sat down, and made me sit beside him. Holding my hand in both his
own, he chafed it; gazing on me, at the same time, with the most
troubled and dreary look.

“My little friend!” said he, “I wish I were in a quiet island with only
you; and trouble, and danger, and hideous recollections removed from
me.”

“Can I help you, sir?—I’d give my life to serve you.”

“Jane, if aid is wanted, I’ll seek it at your hands; I promise you
that.”

“Thank you, sir. Tell me what to do,—I’ll try, at least, to do it.”

“Fetch me now, Jane, a glass of wine from the dining-room: they will be
at supper there; and tell me if Mason is with them, and what he is
doing.”

I went. I found all the party in the dining-room at supper, as Mr.
Rochester had said; they were not seated at table,—the supper was
arranged on the sideboard; each had taken what he chose, and they stood
about here and there in groups, their plates and glasses in their
hands. Every one seemed in high glee; laughter and conversation were
general and animated. Mr. Mason stood near the fire, talking to Colonel
and Mrs. Dent, and appeared as merry as any of them. I filled a
wine-glass (I saw Miss Ingram watch me frowningly as I did so: she
thought I was taking a liberty, I daresay), and I returned to the
library.

Mr. Rochester’s extreme pallor had disappeared, and he looked once more
firm and stern. He took the glass from my hand.

“Here is to your health, ministrant spirit!” he said. He swallowed the
contents and returned it to me. “What are they doing, Jane?”

“Laughing and talking, sir.”

“They don’t look grave and mysterious, as if they had heard something
strange?”

“Not at all: they are full of jests and gaiety.”

“And Mason?”

“He was laughing too.”

“If all these people came in a body and spat at me, what would you do,
Jane?”

“Turn them out of the room, sir, if I could.”

He half smiled. “But if I were to go to them, and they only looked at
me coldly, and whispered sneeringly amongst each other, and then
dropped off and left me one by one, what then? Would you go with them?”

“I rather think not, sir: I should have more pleasure in staying with
you.”

“To comfort me?”

“Yes, sir, to comfort you, as well as I could.”

“And if they laid you under a ban for adhering to me?”

“I, probably, should know nothing about their ban; and if I did, I
should care nothing about it.”

“Then, you could dare censure for my sake?”

“I could dare it for the sake of any friend who deserved my adherence;
as you, I am sure, do.”

“Go back now into the room; step quietly up to Mason, and whisper in
his ear that Mr. Rochester is come and wishes to see him: show him in
here and then leave me.”

“Yes, sir.”

I did his behest. The company all stared at me as I passed straight
among them. I sought Mr. Mason, delivered the message, and preceded him
from the room: I ushered him into the library, and then I went
upstairs.

At a late hour, after I had been in bed some time, I heard the visitors
repair to their chambers: I distinguished Mr. Rochester’s voice, and
heard him say, “This way, Mason; this is your room.”

He spoke cheerfully: the gay tones set my heart at ease. I was soon
asleep.




CHAPTER XX


I had forgotten to draw my curtain, which I usually did, and also to
let down my window-blind. The consequence was, that when the moon,
which was full and bright (for the night was fine), came in her course
to that space in the sky opposite my casement, and looked in at me
through the unveiled panes, her glorious gaze roused me. Awaking in the
dead of night, I opened my eyes on her disk—silver-white and crystal
clear. It was beautiful, but too solemn: I half rose, and stretched my
arm to draw the curtain.

Good God! What a cry!

The night—its silence—its rest, was rent in twain by a savage, a sharp,
a shrilly sound that ran from end to end of Thornfield Hall.

My pulse stopped: my heart stood still; my stretched arm was paralysed.
The cry died, and was not renewed. Indeed, whatever being uttered that
fearful shriek could not soon repeat it: not the widest-winged condor
on the Andes could, twice in succession, send out such a yell from the
cloud shrouding his eyrie. The thing delivering such utterance must
rest ere it could repeat the effort.

It came out of the third storey; for it passed overhead. And
overhead—yes, in the room just above my chamber-ceiling—I now heard a
struggle: a deadly one it seemed from the noise; and a half-smothered
voice shouted—

“Help! help! help!” three times rapidly.

“Will no one come?” it cried; and then, while the staggering and
stamping went on wildly, I distinguished through plank and plaster:—

“Rochester! Rochester! for God’s sake, come!”

A chamber-door opened: some one ran, or rushed, along the gallery.
Another step stamped on the flooring above and something fell; and
there was silence.

I had put on some clothes, though horror shook all my limbs; I issued
from my apartment. The sleepers were all aroused: ejaculations,
terrified murmurs sounded in every room; door after door unclosed; one
looked out and another looked out; the gallery filled. Gentlemen and
ladies alike had quitted their beds; and “Oh! what is it?”—“Who is
hurt?”—“What has happened?”—“Fetch a light!”—“Is it fire?”—“Are there
robbers?”—“Where shall we run?” was demanded confusedly on all hands.
But for the moonlight they would have been in complete darkness. They
ran to and fro; they crowded together: some sobbed, some stumbled: the
confusion was inextricable.

“Where the devil is Rochester?” cried Colonel Dent. “I cannot find him
in his bed.”

“Here! here!” was shouted in return. “Be composed, all of you: I’m
coming.”

And the door at the end of the gallery opened, and Mr. Rochester
advanced with a candle: he had just descended from the upper storey.
One of the ladies ran to him directly; she seized his arm: it was Miss
Ingram.

“What awful event has taken place?” said she. “Speak! let us know the
worst at once!”

“But don’t pull me down or strangle me,” he replied: for the Misses
Eshton were clinging about him now; and the two dowagers, in vast white
wrappers, were bearing down on him like ships in full sail.

“All’s right!—all’s right!” he cried. “It’s a mere rehearsal of Much
Ado about Nothing. Ladies, keep off, or I shall wax dangerous.”

And dangerous he looked: his black eyes darted sparks. Calming himself
by an effort, he added—

“A servant has had the nightmare; that is all. She’s an excitable,
nervous person: she construed her dream into an apparition, or
something of that sort, no doubt; and has taken a fit with fright. Now,
then, I must see you all back into your rooms; for, till the house is
settled, she cannot be looked after. Gentlemen, have the goodness to
set the ladies the example. Miss Ingram, I am sure you will not fail in
evincing superiority to idle terrors. Amy and Louisa, return to your
nests like a pair of doves, as you are. Mesdames” (to the dowagers),
“you will take cold to a dead certainty, if you stay in this chill
gallery any longer.”

And so, by dint of alternate coaxing and commanding, he contrived to
get them all once more enclosed in their separate dormitories. I did
not wait to be ordered back to mine, but retreated unnoticed, as
unnoticed I had left it.

Not, however, to go to bed: on the contrary, I began and dressed myself
carefully. The sounds I had heard after the scream, and the words that
had been uttered, had probably been heard only by me; for they had
proceeded from the room above mine: but they assured me that it was not
a servant’s dream which had thus struck horror through the house; and
that the explanation Mr. Rochester had given was merely an invention
framed to pacify his guests. I dressed, then, to be ready for
emergencies. When dressed, I sat a long time by the window looking out
over the silent grounds and silvered fields and waiting for I knew not
what. It seemed to me that some event must follow the strange cry,
struggle, and call.

No: stillness returned: each murmur and movement ceased gradually, and
in about an hour Thornfield Hall was again as hushed as a desert. It
seemed that sleep and night had resumed their empire. Meantime the moon
declined: she was about to set. Not liking to sit in the cold and
darkness, I thought I would lie down on my bed, dressed as I was. I
left the window, and moved with little noise across the carpet; as I
stooped to take off my shoes, a cautious hand tapped low at the door.

“Am I wanted?” I asked.

“Are you up?” asked the voice I expected to hear, viz., my master’s.

“Yes, sir.”

“And dressed?”

“Yes.”

“Come out, then, quietly.”

I obeyed. Mr. Rochester stood in the gallery holding a light.

“I want you,” he said: “come this way: take your time, and make no
noise.”

My slippers were thin: I could walk the matted floor as softly as a
cat. He glided up the gallery and up the stairs, and stopped in the
dark, low corridor of the fateful third storey: I had followed and
stood at his side.

“Have you a sponge in your room?” he asked in a whisper.

“Yes, sir.”

“Have you any salts—volatile salts?”

“Yes.”

“Go back and fetch both.”

I returned, sought the sponge on the washstand, the salts in my drawer,
and once more retraced my steps. He still waited; he held a key in his
hand: approaching one of the small, black doors, he put it in the lock;
he paused, and addressed me again.

“You don’t turn sick at the sight of blood?”

“I think I shall not: I have never been tried yet.”

I felt a thrill while I answered him; but no coldness, and no
faintness.

“Just give me your hand,” he said: “it will not do to risk a fainting
fit.”

I put my fingers into his. “Warm and steady,” was his remark: he turned
the key and opened the door.

I saw a room I remembered to have seen before, the day Mrs. Fairfax
showed me over the house: it was hung with tapestry; but the tapestry
was now looped up in one part, and there was a door apparent, which had
then been concealed. This door was open; a light shone out of the room
within: I heard thence a snarling, snatching sound, almost like a dog
quarrelling. Mr. Rochester, putting down his candle, said to me, “Wait
a minute,” and he went forward to the inner apartment. A shout of
laughter greeted his entrance; noisy at first, and terminating in Grace
Poole’s own goblin ha! ha! _She_ then was there. He made some sort of
arrangement without speaking, though I heard a low voice address him:
he came out and closed the door behind him.

“Here, Jane!” he said; and I walked round to the other side of a large
bed, which with its drawn curtains concealed a considerable portion of
the chamber. An easy-chair was near the bed-head: a man sat in it,
dressed with the exception of his coat; he was still; his head leant
back; his eyes were closed. Mr. Rochester held the candle over him; I
recognised in his pale and seemingly lifeless face—the stranger, Mason:
I saw too that his linen on one side, and one arm, was almost soaked in
blood.

“Hold the candle,” said Mr. Rochester, and I took it: he fetched a
basin of water from the washstand: “Hold that,” said he. I obeyed. He
took the sponge, dipped it in, and moistened the corpse-like face; he
asked for my smelling-bottle, and applied it to the nostrils. Mr. Mason
shortly unclosed his eyes; he groaned. Mr. Rochester opened the shirt
of the wounded man, whose arm and shoulder were bandaged: he sponged
away blood, trickling fast down.

“Is there immediate danger?” murmured Mr. Mason.

“Pooh! No—a mere scratch. Don’t be so overcome, man: bear up! I’ll
fetch a surgeon for you now, myself: you’ll be able to be removed by
morning, I hope. Jane,” he continued.

“Sir?”

“I shall have to leave you in this room with this gentleman, for an
hour, or perhaps two hours: you will sponge the blood as I do when it
returns: if he feels faint, you will put the glass of water on that
stand to his lips, and your salts to his nose. You will not speak to
him on any pretext—and—Richard, it will be at the peril of your life if
you speak to her: open your lips—agitate yourself—and I’ll not answer
for the consequences.”

Again the poor man groaned; he looked as if he dared not move; fear,
either of death or of something else, appeared almost to paralyse him.
Mr. Rochester put the now bloody sponge into my hand, and I proceeded
to use it as he had done. He watched me a second, then saying,
“Remember!—No conversation,” he left the room. I experienced a strange
feeling as the key grated in the lock, and the sound of his retreating
step ceased to be heard.

Here then I was in the third storey, fastened into one of its mystic
cells; night around me; a pale and bloody spectacle under my eyes and
hands; a murderess hardly separated from me by a single door: yes—that
was appalling—the rest I could bear; but I shuddered at the thought of
Grace Poole bursting out upon me.

I must keep to my post, however. I must watch this ghastly
countenance—these blue, still lips forbidden to unclose—these eyes now
shut, now opening, now wandering through the room, now fixing on me,
and ever glazed with the dulness of horror. I must dip my hand again
and again in the basin of blood and water, and wipe away the trickling
gore. I must see the light of the unsnuffed candle wane on my
employment; the shadows darken on the wrought, antique tapestry round
me, and grow black under the hangings of the vast old bed, and quiver
strangely over the doors of a great cabinet opposite—whose front,
divided into twelve panels, bore, in grim design, the heads of the
twelve apostles, each enclosed in its separate panel as in a frame;
while above them at the top rose an ebon crucifix and a dying Christ.

According as the shifting obscurity and flickering gleam hovered here
or glanced there, it was now the bearded physician, Luke, that bent his
brow; now St. John’s long hair that waved; and anon the devilish face
of Judas, that grew out of the panel, and seemed gathering life and
threatening a revelation of the arch-traitor—of Satan himself—in his
subordinate’s form.

Amidst all this, I had to listen as well as watch: to listen for the
movements of the wild beast or the fiend in yonder side den. But since
Mr. Rochester’s visit it seemed spellbound: all the night I heard but
three sounds at three long intervals,—a step creak, a momentary renewal
of the snarling, canine noise, and a deep human groan.

Then my own thoughts worried me. What crime was this, that lived
incarnate in this sequestered mansion, and could neither be expelled
nor subdued by the owner?—what mystery, that broke out now in fire and
now in blood, at the deadest hours of night? What creature was it,
that, masked in an ordinary woman’s face and shape, uttered the voice,
now of a mocking demon, and anon of a carrion-seeking bird of prey?

And this man I bent over—this commonplace, quiet stranger—how had he
become involved in the web of horror? and why had the Fury flown at
him? What made him seek this quarter of the house at an untimely
season, when he should have been asleep in bed? I had heard Mr.
Rochester assign him an apartment below—what brought him here! And why,
now, was he so tame under the violence or treachery done him? Why did
he so quietly submit to the concealment Mr. Rochester enforced? Why
_did_ Mr. Rochester enforce this concealment? His guest had been
outraged, his own life on a former occasion had been hideously plotted
against; and both attempts he smothered in secrecy and sank in
oblivion! Lastly, I saw Mr. Mason was submissive to Mr. Rochester; that
the impetuous will of the latter held complete sway over the inertness
of the former: the few words which had passed between them assured me
of this. It was evident that in their former intercourse, the passive
disposition of the one had been habitually influenced by the active
energy of the other: whence then had arisen Mr. Rochester’s dismay when
he heard of Mr. Mason’s arrival? Why had the mere name of this
unresisting individual—whom his word now sufficed to control like a
child—fallen on him, a few hours since, as a thunderbolt might fall on
an oak?

Oh! I could not forget his look and his paleness when he whispered:
“Jane, I have got a blow—I have got a blow, Jane.” I could not forget
how the arm had trembled which he rested on my shoulder: and it was no
light matter which could thus bow the resolute spirit and thrill the
vigorous frame of Fairfax Rochester.

“When will he come? When will he come?” I cried inwardly, as the night
lingered and lingered—as my bleeding patient drooped, moaned, sickened:
and neither day nor aid arrived. I had, again and again, held the water
to Mason’s white lips; again and again offered him the stimulating
salts: my efforts seemed ineffectual: either bodily or mental
suffering, or loss of blood, or all three combined, were fast
prostrating his strength. He moaned so, and looked so weak, wild, and
lost, I feared he was dying; and I might not even speak to him.

The candle, wasted at last, went out; as it expired, I perceived
streaks of grey light edging the window curtains: dawn was then
approaching. Presently I heard Pilot bark far below, out of his distant
kennel in the courtyard: hope revived. Nor was it unwarranted: in five
minutes more the grating key, the yielding lock, warned me my watch was
relieved. It could not have lasted more than two hours: many a week has
seemed shorter.

Mr. Rochester entered, and with him the surgeon he had been to fetch.

“Now, Carter, be on the alert,” he said to this last: “I give you but
half-an-hour for dressing the wound, fastening the bandages, getting
the patient downstairs and all.”

“But is he fit to move, sir?”

“No doubt of it; it is nothing serious; he is nervous, his spirits must
be kept up. Come, set to work.”

Mr. Rochester drew back the thick curtain, drew up the holland blind,
let in all the daylight he could; and I was surprised and cheered to
see how far dawn was advanced: what rosy streaks were beginning to
brighten the east. Then he approached Mason, whom the surgeon was
already handling.

“Now, my good fellow, how are you?” he asked.

“She’s done for me, I fear,” was the faint reply.

“Not a whit!—courage! This day fortnight you’ll hardly be a pin the
worse of it: you’ve lost a little blood; that’s all. Carter, assure him
there’s no danger.”

“I can do that conscientiously,” said Carter, who had now undone the
bandages; “only I wish I could have got here sooner: he would not have
bled so much—but how is this? The flesh on the shoulder is torn as well
as cut. This wound was not done with a knife: there have been teeth
here!”

“She bit me,” he murmured. “She worried me like a tigress, when
Rochester got the knife from her.”

“You should not have yielded: you should have grappled with her at
once,” said Mr. Rochester.

“But under such circumstances, what could one do?” returned Mason. “Oh,
it was frightful!” he added, shuddering. “And I did not expect it: she
looked so quiet at first.”

“I warned you,” was his friend’s answer; “I said—be on your guard when
you go near her. Besides, you might have waited till to-morrow, and had
me with you: it was mere folly to attempt the interview to-night, and
alone.”

“I thought I could have done some good.”

“You thought! you thought! Yes, it makes me impatient to hear you: but,
however, you have suffered, and are likely to suffer enough for not
taking my advice; so I’ll say no more. Carter—hurry!—hurry! The sun
will soon rise, and I must have him off.”

“Directly, sir; the shoulder is just bandaged. I must look to this
other wound in the arm: she has had her teeth here too, I think.”

“She sucked the blood: she said she’d drain my heart,” said Mason.

I saw Mr. Rochester shudder: a singularly marked expression of disgust,
horror, hatred, warped his countenance almost to distortion; but he
only said—

“Come, be silent, Richard, and never mind her gibberish: don’t repeat
it.”

“I wish I could forget it,” was the answer.

“You will when you are out of the country: when you get back to Spanish
Town, you may think of her as dead and buried—or rather, you need not
think of her at all.”

“Impossible to forget this night!”

“It is not impossible: have some energy, man. You thought you were as
dead as a herring two hours since, and you are all alive and talking
now. There!—Carter has done with you or nearly so; I’ll make you decent
in a trice. Jane” (he turned to me for the first time since his
re-entrance), “take this key: go down into my bedroom, and walk
straight forward into my dressing-room: open the top drawer of the
wardrobe and take out a clean shirt and neck-handkerchief: bring them
here; and be nimble.”

I went; sought the repository he had mentioned, found the articles
named, and returned with them.

“Now,” said he, “go to the other side of the bed while I order his
toilet; but don’t leave the room: you may be wanted again.”

I retired as directed.

“Was anybody stirring below when you went down, Jane?” inquired Mr.
Rochester presently.

“No, sir; all was very still.”

“We shall get you off cannily, Dick: and it will be better, both for
your sake, and for that of the poor creature in yonder. I have striven
long to avoid exposure, and I should not like it to come at last. Here,
Carter, help him on with his waist-coat. Where did you leave your
furred cloak? You can’t travel a mile without that, I know, in this
damned cold climate. In your room?—Jane, run down to Mr. Mason’s
room,—the one next mine,—and fetch a cloak you will see there.”

Again I ran, and again returned, bearing an immense mantle lined and
edged with fur.

“Now, I’ve another errand for you,” said my untiring master; “you must
away to my room again. What a mercy you are shod with velvet, Jane!—a
clod-hopping messenger would never do at this juncture. You must open
the middle drawer of my toilet-table and take out a little phial and a
little glass you will find there,—quick!”

I flew thither and back, bringing the desired vessels.

“That’s well! Now, doctor, I shall take the liberty of administering a
dose myself, on my own responsibility. I got this cordial at Rome, of
an Italian charlatan—a fellow you would have kicked, Carter. It is not
a thing to be used indiscriminately, but it is good upon occasion: as
now, for instance. Jane, a little water.”

He held out the tiny glass, and I half filled it from the water-bottle
on the washstand.

“That will do;—now wet the lip of the phial.”

I did so; he measured twelve drops of a crimson liquid, and presented
it to Mason.

“Drink, Richard: it will give you the heart you lack, for an hour or
so.”

“But will it hurt me?—is it inflammatory?”

“Drink! drink! drink!”

Mr. Mason obeyed, because it was evidently useless to resist. He was
dressed now: he still looked pale, but he was no longer gory and
sullied. Mr. Rochester let him sit three minutes after he had swallowed
the liquid; he then took his arm—

“Now I am sure you can get on your feet,” he said—“try.”

The patient rose.

“Carter, take him under the other shoulder. Be of good cheer, Richard;
step out—that’s it!”

“I do feel better,” remarked Mr. Mason.

“I am sure you do. Now, Jane, trip on before us away to the backstairs;
unbolt the side-passage door, and tell the driver of the post-chaise
you will see in the yard—or just outside, for I told him not to drive
his rattling wheels over the pavement—to be ready; we are coming: and,
Jane, if any one is about, come to the foot of the stairs and hem.”

It was by this time half-past five, and the sun was on the point of
rising; but I found the kitchen still dark and silent. The side-passage
door was fastened; I opened it with as little noise as possible: all
the yard was quiet; but the gates stood wide open, and there was a
post-chaise, with horses ready harnessed, and driver seated on the box,
stationed outside. I approached him, and said the gentlemen were
coming; he nodded: then I looked carefully round and listened. The
stillness of early morning slumbered everywhere; the curtains were yet
drawn over the servants’ chamber windows; little birds were just
twittering in the blossom-blanched orchard trees, whose boughs drooped
like white garlands over the wall enclosing one side of the yard; the
carriage horses stamped from time to time in their closed stables: all
else was still.

The gentlemen now appeared. Mason, supported by Mr. Rochester and the
surgeon, seemed to walk with tolerable ease: they assisted him into the
chaise; Carter followed.

“Take care of him,” said Mr. Rochester to the latter, “and keep him at
your house till he is quite well: I shall ride over in a day or two to
see how he gets on. Richard, how is it with you?”

“The fresh air revives me, Fairfax.”

“Leave the window open on his side, Carter; there is no wind—good-bye,
Dick.”

“Fairfax—”

“Well what is it?”

“Let her be taken care of; let her be treated as tenderly as may be:
let her—” he stopped and burst into tears.

“I do my best; and have done it, and will do it,” was the answer: he
shut up the chaise door, and the vehicle drove away.

“Yet would to God there was an end of all this!” added Mr. Rochester,
as he closed and barred the heavy yard-gates.

This done, he moved with slow step and abstracted air towards a door in
the wall bordering the orchard. I, supposing he had done with me,
prepared to return to the house; again, however, I heard him call
“Jane!” He had opened the portal and stood at it, waiting for me.

“Come where there is some freshness, for a few moments,” he said; “that
house is a mere dungeon: don’t you feel it so?”

“It seems to me a splendid mansion, sir.”

“The glamour of inexperience is over your eyes,” he answered; “and you
see it through a charmed medium: you cannot discern that the gilding is
slime and the silk draperies cobwebs; that the marble is sordid slate,
and the polished woods mere refuse chips and scaly bark. Now _here_”
(he pointed to the leafy enclosure we had entered) “all is real, sweet,
and pure.”

He strayed down a walk edged with box, with apple trees, pear trees,
and cherry trees on one side, and a border on the other full of all
sorts of old-fashioned flowers, stocks, sweet-williams, primroses,
pansies, mingled with southernwood, sweet-briar, and various fragrant
herbs. They were fresh now as a succession of April showers and gleams,
followed by a lovely spring morning, could make them: the sun was just
entering the dappled east, and his light illumined the wreathed and
dewy orchard trees and shone down the quiet walks under them.

“Jane, will you have a flower?”

He gathered a half-blown rose, the first on the bush, and offered it to
me.

“Thank you, sir.”

“Do you like this sunrise, Jane? That sky with its high and light
clouds which are sure to melt away as the day waxes warm—this placid
and balmly atmosphere?”

“I do, very much.”

“You have passed a strange night, Jane.”

“Yes, sir.”

“And it has made you look pale—were you afraid when I left you alone
with Mason?”

“I was afraid of some one coming out of the inner room.”

“But I had fastened the door—I had the key in my pocket: I should have
been a careless shepherd if I had left a lamb—my pet lamb—so near a
wolf’s den, unguarded: you were safe.”

“Will Grace Poole live here still, sir?”

“Oh yes! don’t trouble your head about her—put the thing out of your
thoughts.”

“Yet it seems to me your life is hardly secure while she stays.”

“Never fear—I will take care of myself.”

“Is the danger you apprehended last night gone by now, sir?”

“I cannot vouch for that till Mason is out of England: nor even then.
To live, for me, Jane, is to stand on a crater-crust which may crack
and spue fire any day.”

“But Mr. Mason seems a man easily led. Your influence, sir, is
evidently potent with him: he will never set you at defiance or
wilfully injure you.”

“Oh, no! Mason will not defy me; nor, knowing it, will he hurt me—but,
unintentionally, he might in a moment, by one careless word, deprive
me, if not of life, yet for ever of happiness.”

“Tell him to be cautious, sir: let him know what you fear, and show him
how to avert the danger.”

He laughed sardonically, hastily took my hand, and as hastily threw it
from him.

“If I could do that, simpleton, where would the danger be? Annihilated
in a moment. Ever since I have known Mason, I have only had to say to
him ‘Do that,’ and the thing has been done. But I cannot give him
orders in this case: I cannot say ‘Beware of harming me, Richard;’ for
it is imperative that I should keep him ignorant that harm to me is
possible. Now you look puzzled; and I will puzzle you further. You are
my little friend, are you not?”

“I like to serve you, sir, and to obey you in all that is right.”

“Precisely: I see you do. I see genuine contentment in your gait and
mien, your eye and face, when you are helping me and pleasing
me—working for me, and with me, in, as you characteristically say,
‘_all that is right_:’ for if I bid you do what you thought wrong,
there would be no light-footed running, no neat-handed alacrity, no
lively glance and animated complexion. My friend would then turn to me,
quiet and pale, and would say, ‘No, sir; that is impossible: I cannot
do it, because it is wrong;’ and would become immutable as a fixed
star. Well, you too have power over me, and may injure me: yet I dare
not show you where I am vulnerable, lest, faithful and friendly as you
are, you should transfix me at once.”

“If you have no more to fear from Mr. Mason than you have from me, sir,
you are very safe.”

“God grant it may be so! Here, Jane, is an arbour; sit down.”

The arbour was an arch in the wall, lined with ivy; it contained a
rustic seat. Mr. Rochester took it, leaving room, however, for me: but
I stood before him.

“Sit,” he said; “the bench is long enough for two. You don’t hesitate
to take a place at my side, do you? Is that wrong, Jane?”

I answered him by assuming it: to refuse would, I felt, have been
unwise.

“Now, my little friend, while the sun drinks the dew—while all the
flowers in this old garden awake and expand, and the birds fetch their
young ones’ breakfast out of the Thornfield, and the early bees do
their first spell of work—I’ll put a case to you, which you must
endeavour to suppose your own: but first, look at me, and tell me you
are at ease, and not fearing that I err in detaining you, or that you
err in staying.”

“No, sir; I am content.”

“Well then, Jane, call to aid your fancy:—suppose you were no longer a
girl well reared and disciplined, but a wild boy indulged from
childhood upwards; imagine yourself in a remote foreign land; conceive
that you there commit a capital error, no matter of what nature or from
what motives, but one whose consequences must follow you through life
and taint all your existence. Mind, I don’t say a _crime_; I am not
speaking of shedding of blood or any other guilty act, which might make
the perpetrator amenable to the law: my word is _error_. The results of
what you have done become in time to you utterly insupportable; you
take measures to obtain relief: unusual measures, but neither unlawful
nor culpable. Still you are miserable; for hope has quitted you on the
very confines of life: your sun at noon darkens in an eclipse, which
you feel will not leave it till the time of setting. Bitter and base
associations have become the sole food of your memory: you wander here
and there, seeking rest in exile: happiness in pleasure—I mean in
heartless, sensual pleasure—such as dulls intellect and blights
feeling. Heart-weary and soul-withered, you come home after years of
voluntary banishment: you make a new acquaintance—how or where no
matter: you find in this stranger much of the good and bright qualities
which you have sought for twenty years, and never before encountered;
and they are all fresh, healthy, without soil and without taint. Such
society revives, regenerates: you feel better days come back—higher
wishes, purer feelings; you desire to recommence your life, and to
spend what remains to you of days in a way more worthy of an immortal
being. To attain this end, are you justified in overleaping an obstacle
of custom—a mere conventional impediment which neither your conscience
sanctifies nor your judgment approves?”

He paused for an answer: and what was I to say? Oh, for some good
spirit to suggest a judicious and satisfactory response! Vain
aspiration! The west wind whispered in the ivy round me; but no gentle
Ariel borrowed its breath as a medium of speech: the birds sang in the
tree-tops; but their song, however sweet, was inarticulate.

Again Mr. Rochester propounded his query:

“Is the wandering and sinful, but now rest-seeking and repentant, man
justified in daring the world’s opinion, in order to attach to him for
ever this gentle, gracious, genial stranger, thereby securing his own
peace of mind and regeneration of life?”

“Sir,” I answered, “a wanderer’s repose or a sinner’s reformation
should never depend on a fellow-creature. Men and women die;
philosophers falter in wisdom, and Christians in goodness: if any one
you know has suffered and erred, let him look higher than his equals
for strength to amend and solace to heal.”

“But the instrument—the instrument! God, who does the work, ordains the
instrument. I have myself—I tell it you without parable—been a worldly,
dissipated, restless man; and I believe I have found the instrument for
my cure in—”

He paused: the birds went on carolling, the leaves lightly rustling. I
almost wondered they did not check their songs and whispers to catch
the suspended revelation; but they would have had to wait many
minutes—so long was the silence protracted. At last I looked up at the
tardy speaker: he was looking eagerly at me.

“Little friend,” said he, in quite a changed tone—while his face
changed too, losing all its softness and gravity, and becoming harsh
and sarcastic—“you have noticed my tender penchant for Miss Ingram:
don’t you think if I married her she would regenerate me with a
vengeance?”

He got up instantly, went quite to the other end of the walk, and when
he came back he was humming a tune.

“Jane, Jane,” said he, stopping before me, “you are quite pale with
your vigils: don’t you curse me for disturbing your rest?”

“Curse you? No, sir.”

“Shake hands in confirmation of the word. What cold fingers! They were
warmer last night when I touched them at the door of the mysterious
chamber. Jane, when will you watch with me again?”

“Whenever I can be useful, sir.”

“For instance, the night before I am married! I am sure I shall not be
able to sleep. Will you promise to sit up with me to bear me company?
To you I can talk of my lovely one: for now you have seen her and know
her.”

“Yes, sir.”

“She’s a rare one, is she not, Jane?”

“Yes, sir.”

“A strapper—a real strapper, Jane: big, brown, and buxom; with hair
just such as the ladies of Carthage must have had. Bless me! there’s
Dent and Lynn in the stables! Go in by the shrubbery, through that
wicket.”

As I went one way, he went another, and I heard him in the yard, saying
cheerfully—

“Mason got the start of you all this morning; he was gone before
sunrise: I rose at four to see him off.”




CHAPTER XXI


Presentiments are strange things! and so are sympathies; and so are
signs; and the three combined make one mystery to which humanity has
not yet found the key. I never laughed at presentiments in my life,
because I have had strange ones of my own. Sympathies, I believe, exist
(for instance, between far-distant, long-absent, wholly estranged
relatives asserting, notwithstanding their alienation, the unity of the
source to which each traces his origin) whose workings baffle mortal
comprehension. And signs, for aught we know, may be but the sympathies
of Nature with man.

When I was a little girl, only six years old, I one night heard Bessie
Leaven say to Martha Abbot that she had been dreaming about a little
child; and that to dream of children was a sure sign of trouble, either
to one’s self or one’s kin. The saying might have worn out of my
memory, had not a circumstance immediately followed which served
indelibly to fix it there. The next day Bessie was sent for home to the
deathbed of her little sister.

Of late I had often recalled this saying and this incident; for during
the past week scarcely a night had gone over my couch that had not
brought with it a dream of an infant, which I sometimes hushed in my
arms, sometimes dandled on my knee, sometimes watched playing with
daisies on a lawn, or again, dabbling its hands in running water. It
was a wailing child this night, and a laughing one the next: now it
nestled close to me, and now it ran from me; but whatever mood the
apparition evinced, whatever aspect it wore, it failed not for seven
successive nights to meet me the moment I entered the land of slumber.

I did not like this iteration of one idea—this strange recurrence of
one image, and I grew nervous as bedtime approached and the hour of the
vision drew near. It was from companionship with this baby-phantom I
had been roused on that moonlight night when I heard the cry; and it
was on the afternoon of the day following I was summoned downstairs by
a message that some one wanted me in Mrs. Fairfax’s room. On repairing
thither, I found a man waiting for me, having the appearance of a
gentleman’s servant: he was dressed in deep mourning, and the hat he
held in his hand was surrounded with a crape band.

“I daresay you hardly remember me, Miss,” he said, rising as I entered;
“but my name is Leaven: I lived coachman with Mrs. Reed when you were
at Gateshead, eight or nine years since, and I live there still.”

“Oh, Robert! how do you do? I remember you very well: you used to give
me a ride sometimes on Miss Georgiana’s bay pony. And how is Bessie?
You are married to Bessie?”

“Yes, Miss: my wife is very hearty, thank you; she brought me another
little one about two months since—we have three now—and both mother and
child are thriving.”

“And are the family well at the house, Robert?”

“I am sorry I can’t give you better news of them, Miss: they are very
badly at present—in great trouble.”

“I hope no one is dead,” I said, glancing at his black dress. He too
looked down at the crape round his hat and replied—

“Mr. John died yesterday was a week, at his chambers in London.”

“Mr. John?”

“Yes.”

“And how does his mother bear it?”

“Why, you see, Miss Eyre, it is not a common mishap: his life has been
very wild: these last three years he gave himself up to strange ways,
and his death was shocking.”

“I heard from Bessie he was not doing well.”

“Doing well! He could not do worse: he ruined his health and his estate
amongst the worst men and the worst women. He got into debt and into
jail: his mother helped him out twice, but as soon as he was free he
returned to his old companions and habits. His head was not strong: the
knaves he lived amongst fooled him beyond anything I ever heard. He
came down to Gateshead about three weeks ago and wanted missis to give
up all to him. Missis refused: her means have long been much reduced by
his extravagance; so he went back again, and the next news was that he
was dead. How he died, God knows!—they say he killed himself.”

I was silent: the tidings were frightful. Robert Leaven resumed—

“Missis had been out of health herself for some time: she had got very
stout, but was not strong with it; and the loss of money and fear of
poverty were quite breaking her down. The information about Mr. John’s
death and the manner of it came too suddenly: it brought on a stroke.
She was three days without speaking; but last Tuesday she seemed rather
better: she appeared as if she wanted to say something, and kept making
signs to my wife and mumbling. It was only yesterday morning, however,
that Bessie understood she was pronouncing your name; and at last she
made out the words, ‘Bring Jane—fetch Jane Eyre: I want to speak to
her.’ Bessie is not sure whether she is in her right mind, or means
anything by the words; but she told Miss Reed and Miss Georgiana, and
advised them to send for you. The young ladies put it off at first; but
their mother grew so restless, and said, ‘Jane, Jane,’ so many times,
that at last they consented. I left Gateshead yesterday: and if you can
get ready, Miss, I should like to take you back with me early to-morrow
morning.”

“Yes, Robert, I shall be ready: it seems to me that I ought to go.”

“I think so too, Miss. Bessie said she was sure you would not refuse:
but I suppose you will have to ask leave before you can get off?”

“Yes; and I will do it now;” and having directed him to the servants’
hall, and recommended him to the care of John’s wife, and the
attentions of John himself, I went in search of Mr. Rochester.

He was not in any of the lower rooms; he was not in the yard, the
stables, or the grounds. I asked Mrs. Fairfax if she had seen him;—yes:
she believed he was playing billiards with Miss Ingram. To the
billiard-room I hastened: the click of balls and the hum of voices
resounded thence; Mr. Rochester, Miss Ingram, the two Misses Eshton,
and their admirers, were all busied in the game. It required some
courage to disturb so interesting a party; my errand, however, was one
I could not defer, so I approached the master where he stood at Miss
Ingram’s side. She turned as I drew near, and looked at me haughtily:
her eyes seemed to demand, “What can the creeping creature want now?”
and when I said, in a low voice, “Mr. Rochester,” she made a movement
as if tempted to order me away. I remember her appearance at the
moment—it was very graceful and very striking: she wore a morning robe
of sky-blue crape; a gauzy azure scarf was twisted in her hair. She had
been all animation with the game, and irritated pride did not lower the
expression of her haughty lineaments.

“Does that person want you?” she inquired of Mr. Rochester; and Mr.
Rochester turned to see who the “person” was. He made a curious
grimace—one of his strange and equivocal demonstrations—threw down his
cue and followed me from the room.

“Well, Jane?” he said, as he rested his back against the schoolroom
door, which he had shut.

“If you please, sir, I want leave of absence for a week or two.”

“What to do?—where to go?”

“To see a sick lady who has sent for me.”

“What sick lady?—where does she live?”

“At Gateshead; in ——shire.”

“-shire? That is a hundred miles off! Who may she be that sends for
people to see her that distance?”

“Her name is Reed, sir—Mrs. Reed.”

“Reed of Gateshead? There was a Reed of Gateshead, a magistrate.”

“It is his widow, sir.”

“And what have you to do with her? How do you know her?”

“Mr. Reed was my uncle—my mother’s brother.”

“The deuce he was! You never told me that before: you always said you
had no relations.”

“None that would own me, sir. Mr. Reed is dead, and his wife cast me
off.”

“Why?”

“Because I was poor, and burdensome, and she disliked me.”

“But Reed left children?—you must have cousins? Sir George Lynn was
talking of a Reed of Gateshead yesterday, who, he said, was one of the
veriest rascals on town; and Ingram was mentioning a Georgiana Reed of
the same place, who was much admired for her beauty a season or two ago
in London.”

“John Reed is dead, too, sir: he ruined himself and half-ruined his
family, and is supposed to have committed suicide. The news so shocked
his mother that it brought on an apoplectic attack.”

“And what good can you do her? Nonsense, Jane! I would never think of
running a hundred miles to see an old lady who will, perhaps, be dead
before you reach her: besides, you say she cast you off.”

“Yes, sir, but that is long ago; and when her circumstances were very
different: I could not be easy to neglect her wishes now.”

“How long will you stay?”

“As short a time as possible, sir.”

“Promise me only to stay a week—”

“I had better not pass my word: I might be obliged to break it.”

“At all events you _will_ come back: you will not be induced under any
pretext to take up a permanent residence with her?”

“Oh, no! I shall certainly return if all be well.”

“And who goes with you? You don’t travel a hundred miles alone.”

“No, sir, she has sent her coachman.”

“A person to be trusted?”

“Yes, sir, he has lived ten years in the family.”

Mr. Rochester meditated. “When do you wish to go?”

“Early to-morrow morning, sir.”

“Well, you must have some money; you can’t travel without money, and I
daresay you have not much: I have given you no salary yet. How much
have you in the world, Jane?” he asked, smiling.

I drew out my purse; a meagre thing it was. “Five shillings, sir.” He
took the purse, poured the hoard into his palm, and chuckled over it as
if its scantiness amused him. Soon he produced his pocket-book: “Here,”
said he, offering me a note; it was fifty pounds, and he owed me but
fifteen. I told him I had no change.

“I don’t want change; you know that. Take your wages.”

I declined accepting more than was my due. He scowled at first; then,
as if recollecting something, he said—

“Right, right! Better not give you all now: you would, perhaps, stay
away three months if you had fifty pounds. There are ten; is it not
plenty?”

“Yes, sir, but now you owe me five.”

“Come back for it, then; I am your banker for forty pounds.”

“Mr. Rochester, I may as well mention another matter of business to you
while I have the opportunity.”

“Matter of business? I am curious to hear it.”

“You have as good as informed me, sir, that you are going shortly to be
married?”

“Yes; what then?”

“In that case, sir, Adèle ought to go to school: I am sure you will
perceive the necessity of it.”

“To get her out of my bride’s way, who might otherwise walk over her
rather too emphatically? There’s sense in the suggestion; not a doubt
of it. Adèle, as you say, must go to school; and you, of course, must
march straight to—the devil?”

“I hope not, sir; but I must seek another situation somewhere.”

“In course!” he exclaimed, with a twang of voice and a distortion of
features equally fantastic and ludicrous. He looked at me some minutes.

“And old Madam Reed, or the Misses, her daughters, will be solicited by
you to seek a place, I suppose?”

“No, sir; I am not on such terms with my relatives as would justify me
in asking favours of them—but I shall advertise.”

“You shall walk up the pyramids of Egypt!” he growled. “At your peril
you advertise! I wish I had only offered you a sovereign instead of ten
pounds. Give me back nine pounds, Jane; I’ve a use for it.”

“And so have I, sir,” I returned, putting my hands and my purse behind
me. “I could not spare the money on any account.”

“Little niggard!” said he, “refusing me a pecuniary request! Give me
five pounds, Jane.”

“Not five shillings, sir; nor five pence.”

“Just let me look at the cash.”

“No, sir; you are not to be trusted.”

“Jane!”

“Sir?”

“Promise me one thing.”

“I’ll promise you anything, sir, that I think I am likely to perform.”

“Not to advertise: and to trust this quest of a situation to me. I’ll
find you one in time.”

“I shall be glad so to do, sir, if you, in your turn, will promise that
I and Adèle shall be both safe out of the house before your bride
enters it.”

“Very well! very well! I’ll pledge my word on it. You go to-morrow,
then?”

“Yes, sir; early.”

“Shall you come down to the drawing-room after dinner?”

“No, sir, I must prepare for the journey.”

“Then you and I must bid good-bye for a little while?”

“I suppose so, sir.”

“And how do people perform that ceremony of parting, Jane? Teach me;
I’m not quite up to it.”

“They say, Farewell, or any other form they prefer.”

“Then say it.”

“Farewell, Mr. Rochester, for the present.”

“What must I say?”

“The same, if you like, sir.”

“Farewell, Miss Eyre, for the present; is that all?”

“Yes.”

“It seems stingy, to my notions, and dry, and unfriendly. I should like
something else: a little addition to the rite. If one shook hands, for
instance; but no—that would not content me either. So you’ll do no more
than say Farewell, Jane?”

“It is enough, sir: as much good-will may be conveyed in one hearty
word as in many.”

“Very likely; but it is blank and cool—‘Farewell.’”

“How long is he going to stand with his back against that door?” I
asked myself; “I want to commence my packing.” The dinner-bell rang,
and suddenly away he bolted, without another syllable: I saw him no
more during the day, and was off before he had risen in the morning.

I reached the lodge at Gateshead about five o’clock in the afternoon of
the first of May: I stepped in there before going up to the hall. It
was very clean and neat: the ornamental windows were hung with little
white curtains; the floor was spotless; the grate and fire-irons were
burnished bright, and the fire burnt clear. Bessie sat on the hearth,
nursing her last-born, and Robert and his sister played quietly in a
corner.

“Bless you!—I knew you would come!” exclaimed Mrs. Leaven, as I
entered.

“Yes, Bessie,” said I, after I had kissed her; “and I trust I am not
too late. How is Mrs. Reed?—Alive still, I hope.”

“Yes, she is alive; and more sensible and collected than she was. The
doctor says she may linger a week or two yet; but he hardly thinks she
will finally recover.”

“Has she mentioned me lately?”

“She was talking of you only this morning, and wishing you would come,
but she is sleeping now, or was ten minutes ago, when I was up at the
house. She generally lies in a kind of lethargy all the afternoon, and
wakes up about six or seven. Will you rest yourself here an hour, Miss,
and then I will go up with you?”

Robert here entered, and Bessie laid her sleeping child in the cradle
and went to welcome him: afterwards she insisted on my taking off my
bonnet and having some tea; for she said I looked pale and tired. I was
glad to accept her hospitality; and I submitted to be relieved of my
travelling garb just as passively as I used to let her undress me when
a child.

Old times crowded fast back on me as I watched her bustling
about—setting out the tea-tray with her best china, cutting bread and
butter, toasting a tea-cake, and, between whiles, giving little Robert
or Jane an occasional tap or push, just as she used to give me in
former days. Bessie had retained her quick temper as well as her light
foot and good looks.

Tea ready, I was going to approach the table; but she desired me to sit
still, quite in her old peremptory tones. I must be served at the
fireside, she said; and she placed before me a little round stand with
my cup and a plate of toast, absolutely as she used to accommodate me
with some privately purloined dainty on a nursery chair: and I smiled
and obeyed her as in bygone days.

She wanted to know if I was happy at Thornfield Hall, and what sort of
a person the mistress was; and when I told her there was only a master,
whether he was a nice gentleman, and if I liked him. I told her he was
rather an ugly man, but quite a gentleman; and that he treated me
kindly, and I was content. Then I went on to describe to her the gay
company that had lately been staying at the house; and to these details
Bessie listened with interest: they were precisely of the kind she
relished.

In such conversation an hour was soon gone: Bessie restored to me my
bonnet, &c., and, accompanied by her, I quitted the lodge for the hall.
It was also accompanied by her that I had, nearly nine years ago,
walked down the path I was now ascending. On a dark, misty, raw morning
in January, I had left a hostile roof with a desperate and embittered
heart—a sense of outlawry and almost of reprobation—to seek the chilly
harbourage of Lowood: that bourne so far away and unexplored. The same
hostile roof now again rose before me: my prospects were doubtful yet;
and I had yet an aching heart. I still felt as a wanderer on the face
of the earth; but I experienced firmer trust in myself and my own
powers, and less withering dread of oppression. The gaping wound of my
wrongs, too, was now quite healed; and the flame of resentment
extinguished.

“You shall go into the breakfast-room first,” said Bessie, as she
preceded me through the hall; “the young ladies will be there.”

In another moment I was within that apartment. There was every article
of furniture looking just as it did on the morning I was first
introduced to Mr. Brocklehurst: the very rug he had stood upon still
covered the hearth. Glancing at the bookcases, I thought I could
distinguish the two volumes of Bewick’s British Birds occupying their
old place on the third shelf, and Gulliver’s Travels and the Arabian
Nights ranged just above. The inanimate objects were not changed; but
the living things had altered past recognition.

Two young ladies appeared before me; one very tall, almost as tall as
Miss Ingram—very thin too, with a sallow face and severe mien. There
was something ascetic in her look, which was augmented by the extreme
plainness of a straight-skirted, black, stuff dress, a starched linen
collar, hair combed away from the temples, and the nun-like ornament of
a string of ebony beads and a crucifix. This I felt sure was Eliza,
though I could trace little resemblance to her former self in that
elongated and colourless visage.

The other was as certainly Georgiana: but not the Georgiana I
remembered—the slim and fairy-like girl of eleven. This was a
full-blown, very plump damsel, fair as waxwork, with handsome and
regular features, languishing blue eyes, and ringleted yellow hair. The
hue of her dress was black too; but its fashion was so different from
her sister’s—so much more flowing and becoming—it looked as stylish as
the other’s looked puritanical.

In each of the sisters there was one trait of the mother—and only one;
the thin and pallid elder daughter had her parent’s Cairngorm eye: the
blooming and luxuriant younger girl had her contour of jaw and
chin—perhaps a little softened, but still imparting an indescribable
hardness to the countenance otherwise so voluptuous and buxom.

Both ladies, as I advanced, rose to welcome me, and both addressed me
by the name of “Miss Eyre.” Eliza’s greeting was delivered in a short,
abrupt voice, without a smile; and then she sat down again, fixed her
eyes on the fire, and seemed to forget me. Georgiana added to her “How
d’ye do?” several commonplaces about my journey, the weather, and so
on, uttered in rather a drawling tone: and accompanied by sundry
side-glances that measured me from head to foot—now traversing the
folds of my drab merino pelisse, and now lingering on the plain
trimming of my cottage bonnet. Young ladies have a remarkable way of
letting you know that they think you a “quiz” without actually saying
the words. A certain superciliousness of look, coolness of manner,
nonchalance of tone, express fully their sentiments on the point,
without committing them by any positive rudeness in word or deed.

A sneer, however, whether covert or open, had now no longer that power
over me it once possessed: as I sat between my cousins, I was surprised
to find how easy I felt under the total neglect of the one and the
semi-sarcastic attentions of the other—Eliza did not mortify, nor
Georgiana ruffle me. The fact was, I had other things to think about;
within the last few months feelings had been stirred in me so much more
potent than any they could raise—pains and pleasures so much more acute
and exquisite had been excited than any it was in their power to
inflict or bestow—that their airs gave me no concern either for good or
bad.

“How is Mrs. Reed?” I asked soon, looking calmly at Georgiana, who
thought fit to bridle at the direct address, as if it were an
unexpected liberty.

“Mrs. Reed? Ah! mama, you mean; she is extremely poorly: I doubt if you
can see her to-night.”

“If,” said I, “you would just step upstairs and tell her I am come, I
should be much obliged to you.”

Georgiana almost started, and she opened her blue eyes wild and wide.
“I know she had a particular wish to see me,” I added, “and I would not
defer attending to her desire longer than is absolutely necessary.”

“Mama dislikes being disturbed in an evening,” remarked Eliza. I soon
rose, quietly took off my bonnet and gloves, uninvited, and said I
would just step out to Bessie—who was, I dared say, in the kitchen—and
ask her to ascertain whether Mrs. Reed was disposed to receive me or
not to-night. I went, and having found Bessie and despatched her on my
errand, I proceeded to take further measures. It had heretofore been my
habit always to shrink from arrogance: received as I had been to-day, I
should, a year ago, have resolved to quit Gateshead the very next
morning; now, it was disclosed to me all at once that that would be a
foolish plan. I had taken a journey of a hundred miles to see my aunt,
and I must stay with her till she was better—or dead: as to her
daughters’ pride or folly, I must put it on one side, make myself
independent of it. So I addressed the housekeeper; asked her to show me
a room, told her I should probably be a visitor here for a week or two,
had my trunk conveyed to my chamber, and followed it thither myself: I
met Bessie on the landing.

“Missis is awake,” said she; “I have told her you are here: come and
let us see if she will know you.”

I did not need to be guided to the well-known room, to which I had so
often been summoned for chastisement or reprimand in former days. I
hastened before Bessie; I softly opened the door: a shaded light stood
on the table, for it was now getting dark. There was the great
four-post bed with amber hangings as of old; there the toilet-table,
the armchair, and the footstool, at which I had a hundred times been
sentenced to kneel, to ask pardon for offences by me uncommitted. I
looked into a certain corner near, half-expecting to see the slim
outline of a once dreaded switch which used to lurk there, waiting to
leap out imp-like and lace my quivering palm or shrinking neck. I
approached the bed; I opened the curtains and leant over the high-piled
pillows.

Well did I remember Mrs. Reed’s face, and I eagerly sought the familiar
image. It is a happy thing that time quells the longings of vengeance
and hushes the promptings of rage and aversion. I had left this woman
in bitterness and hate, and I came back to her now with no other
emotion than a sort of ruth for her great sufferings, and a strong
yearning to forget and forgive all injuries—to be reconciled and clasp
hands in amity.

The well-known face was there: stern, relentless as ever—there was that
peculiar eye which nothing could melt, and the somewhat raised,
imperious, despotic eyebrow. How often had it lowered on me menace and
hate! and how the recollection of childhood’s terrors and sorrows
revived as I traced its harsh line now! And yet I stooped down and
kissed her: she looked at me.

“Is this Jane Eyre?” she said.

“Yes, Aunt Reed. How are you, dear aunt?”

I had once vowed that I would never call her aunt again: I thought it
no sin to forget and break that vow now. My fingers had fastened on her
hand which lay outside the sheet: had she pressed mine kindly, I should
at that moment have experienced true pleasure. But unimpressionable
natures are not so soon softened, nor are natural antipathies so
readily eradicated. Mrs. Reed took her hand away, and, turning her face
rather from me, she remarked that the night was warm. Again she
regarded me so icily, I felt at once that her opinion of me—her feeling
towards me—was unchanged and unchangeable. I knew by her stony
eye—opaque to tenderness, indissoluble to tears—that she was resolved
to consider me bad to the last; because to believe me good would give
her no generous pleasure: only a sense of mortification.

I felt pain, and then I felt ire; and then I felt a determination to
subdue her—to be her mistress in spite both of her nature and her will.
My tears had risen, just as in childhood: I ordered them back to their
source. I brought a chair to the bed-head: I sat down and leaned over
the pillow.

“You sent for me,” I said, “and I am here; and it is my intention to
stay till I see how you get on.”

“Oh, of course! You have seen my daughters?”

“Yes.”

“Well, you may tell them I wish you to stay till I can talk some things
over with you I have on my mind: to-night it is too late, and I have a
difficulty in recalling them. But there was something I wished to
say—let me see—”

The wandering look and changed utterance told what wreck had taken
place in her once vigorous frame. Turning restlessly, she drew the
bedclothes round her; my elbow, resting on a corner of the quilt, fixed
it down: she was at once irritated.

“Sit up!” said she; “don’t annoy me with holding the clothes fast. Are
you Jane Eyre?”

“I am Jane Eyre.”

“I have had more trouble with that child than any one would believe.
Such a burden to be left on my hands—and so much annoyance as she
caused me, daily and hourly, with her incomprehensible disposition, and
her sudden starts of temper, and her continual, unnatural watchings of
one’s movements! I declare she talked to me once like something mad, or
like a fiend—no child ever spoke or looked as she did; I was glad to
get her away from the house. What did they do with her at Lowood? The
fever broke out there, and many of the pupils died. She, however, did
not die: but I said she did—I wish she had died!”

“A strange wish, Mrs. Reed; why do you hate her so?”

“I had a dislike to her mother always; for she was my husband’s only
sister, and a great favourite with him: he opposed the family’s
disowning her when she made her low marriage; and when news came of her
death, he wept like a simpleton. He would send for the baby; though I
entreated him rather to put it out to nurse and pay for its
maintenance. I hated it the first time I set my eyes on it—a sickly,
whining, pining thing! It would wail in its cradle all night long—not
screaming heartily like any other child, but whimpering and moaning.
Reed pitied it; and he used to nurse it and notice it as if it had been
his own: more, indeed, than he ever noticed his own at that age. He
would try to make my children friendly to the little beggar: the
darlings could not bear it, and he was angry with them when they showed
their dislike. In his last illness, he had it brought continually to
his bedside; and but an hour before he died, he bound me by vow to keep
the creature. I would as soon have been charged with a pauper brat out
of a workhouse: but he was weak, naturally weak. John does not at all
resemble his father, and I am glad of it: John is like me and like my
brothers—he is quite a Gibson. Oh, I wish he would cease tormenting me
with letters for money! I have no more money to give him: we are
getting poor. I must send away half the servants and shut up part of
the house; or let it off. I can never submit to do that—yet how are we
to get on? Two-thirds of my income goes in paying the interest of
mortgages. John gambles dreadfully, and always loses—poor boy! He is
beset by sharpers: John is sunk and degraded—his look is frightful—I
feel ashamed for him when I see him.”

She was getting much excited. “I think I had better leave her now,”
said I to Bessie, who stood on the other side of the bed.

“Perhaps you had, Miss: but she often talks in this way towards
night—in the morning she is calmer.”

I rose. “Stop!” exclaimed Mrs. Reed, “there is another thing I wished
to say. He threatens me—he continually threatens me with his own death,
or mine: and I dream sometimes that I see him laid out with a great
wound in his throat, or with a swollen and blackened face. I am come to
a strange pass: I have heavy troubles. What is to be done? How is the
money to be had?”

Bessie now endeavoured to persuade her to take a sedative draught: she
succeeded with difficulty. Soon after, Mrs. Reed grew more composed,
and sank into a dozing state. I then left her.

More than ten days elapsed before I had again any conversation with
her. She continued either delirious or lethargic; and the doctor
forbade everything which could painfully excite her. Meantime, I got on
as well as I could with Georgiana and Eliza. They were very cold,
indeed, at first. Eliza would sit half the day sewing, reading, or
writing, and scarcely utter a word either to me or her sister.
Georgiana would chatter nonsense to her canary bird by the hour, and
take no notice of me. But I was determined not to seem at a loss for
occupation or amusement: I had brought my drawing materials with me,
and they served me for both.

Provided with a case of pencils, and some sheets of paper, I used to
take a seat apart from them, near the window, and busy myself in
sketching fancy vignettes, representing any scene that happened
momentarily to shape itself in the ever-shifting kaleidoscope of
imagination: a glimpse of sea between two rocks; the rising moon, and a
ship crossing its disk; a group of reeds and water-flags, and a naiad’s
head, crowned with lotus-flowers, rising out of them; an elf sitting in
a hedge-sparrow’s nest, under a wreath of hawthorn-bloom.

One morning I fell to sketching a face: what sort of a face it was to
be, I did not care or know. I took a soft black pencil, gave it a broad
point, and worked away. Soon I had traced on the paper a broad and
prominent forehead and a square lower outline of visage: that contour
gave me pleasure; my fingers proceeded actively to fill it with
features. Strongly-marked horizontal eyebrows must be traced under that
brow; then followed, naturally, a well-defined nose, with a straight
ridge and full nostrils; then a flexible-looking mouth, by no means
narrow; then a firm chin, with a decided cleft down the middle of it:
of course, some black whiskers were wanted, and some jetty hair, tufted
on the temples, and waved above the forehead. Now for the eyes: I had
left them to the last, because they required the most careful working.
I drew them large; I shaped them well: the eyelashes I traced long and
sombre; the irids lustrous and large. “Good! but not quite the thing,”
I thought, as I surveyed the effect: “they want more force and spirit;”
and I wrought the shades blacker, that the lights might flash more
brilliantly—a happy touch or two secured success. There, I had a
friend’s face under my gaze; and what did it signify that those young
ladies turned their backs on me? I looked at it; I smiled at the
speaking likeness: I was absorbed and content.

“Is that a portrait of some one you know?” asked Eliza, who had
approached me unnoticed. I responded that it was merely a fancy head,
and hurried it beneath the other sheets. Of course, I lied: it was, in
fact, a very faithful representation of Mr. Rochester. But what was
that to her, or to any one but myself? Georgiana also advanced to look.
The other drawings pleased her much, but she called that “an ugly man.”
They both seemed surprised at my skill. I offered to sketch their
portraits; and each, in turn, sat for a pencil outline. Then Georgiana
produced her album. I promised to contribute a water-colour drawing:
this put her at once into good humour. She proposed a walk in the
grounds. Before we had been out two hours, we were deep in a
confidential conversation: she had favoured me with a description of
the brilliant winter she had spent in London two seasons ago—of the
admiration she had there excited—the attention she had received; and I
even got hints of the titled conquest she had made. In the course of
the afternoon and evening these hints were enlarged on: various soft
conversations were reported, and sentimental scenes represented; and,
in short, a volume of a novel of fashionable life was that day
improvised by her for my benefit. The communications were renewed from
day to day: they always ran on the same theme—herself, her loves, and
woes. It was strange she never once adverted either to her mother’s
illness, or her brother’s death, or the present gloomy state of the
family prospects. Her mind seemed wholly taken up with reminiscences of
past gaiety, and aspirations after dissipations to come. She passed
about five minutes each day in her mother’s sick-room, and no more.

Eliza still spoke little: she had evidently no time to talk. I never
saw a busier person than she seemed to be; yet it was difficult to say
what she did: or rather, to discover any result of her diligence. She
had an alarm to call her up early. I know not how she occupied herself
before breakfast, but after that meal she divided her time into regular
portions, and each hour had its allotted task. Three times a day she
studied a little book, which I found, on inspection, was a Common
Prayer Book. I asked her once what was the great attraction of that
volume, and she said, “the Rubric.” Three hours she gave to stitching,
with gold thread, the border of a square crimson cloth, almost large
enough for a carpet. In answer to my inquiries after the use of this
article, she informed me it was a covering for the altar of a new
church lately erected near Gateshead. Two hours she devoted to her
diary; two to working by herself in the kitchen-garden; and one to the
regulation of her accounts. She seemed to want no company; no
conversation. I believe she was happy in her way: this routine sufficed
for her; and nothing annoyed her so much as the occurrence of any
incident which forced her to vary its clockwork regularity.

She told me one evening, when more disposed to be communicative than
usual, that John’s conduct, and the threatened ruin of the family, had
been a source of profound affliction to her: but she had now, she said,
settled her mind, and formed her resolution. Her own fortune she had
taken care to secure; and when her mother died—and it was wholly
improbable, she tranquilly remarked, that she should either recover or
linger long—she would execute a long-cherished project: seek a
retirement where punctual habits would be permanently secured from
disturbance, and place safe barriers between herself and a frivolous
world. I asked if Georgiana would accompany her.

“Of course not. Georgiana and she had nothing in common: they never had
had. She would not be burdened with her society for any consideration.
Georgiana should take her own course; and she, Eliza, would take hers.”

Georgiana, when not unburdening her heart to me, spent most of her time
in lying on the sofa, fretting about the dulness of the house, and
wishing over and over again that her aunt Gibson would send her an
invitation up to town. “It would be so much better,” she said, “if she
could only get out of the way for a month or two, till all was over.” I
did not ask what she meant by “all being over,” but I suppose she
referred to the expected decease of her mother and the gloomy sequel of
funeral rites. Eliza generally took no more notice of her sister’s
indolence and complaints than if no such murmuring, lounging object had
been before her. One day, however, as she put away her account-book and
unfolded her embroidery, she suddenly took her up thus—

“Georgiana, a more vain and absurd animal than you was certainly never
allowed to cumber the earth. You had no right to be born, for you make
no use of life. Instead of living for, in, and with yourself, as a
reasonable being ought, you seek only to fasten your feebleness on some
other person’s strength: if no one can be found willing to burden her
or himself with such a fat, weak, puffy, useless thing, you cry out
that you are ill-treated, neglected, miserable. Then, too, existence
for you must be a scene of continual change and excitement, or else the
world is a dungeon: you must be admired, you must be courted, you must
be flattered—you must have music, dancing, and society—or you languish,
you die away. Have you no sense to devise a system which will make you
independent of all efforts, and all wills, but your own? Take one day;
share it into sections; to each section apportion its task: leave no
stray unemployed quarters of an hour, ten minutes, five minutes—include
all; do each piece of business in its turn with method, with rigid
regularity. The day will close almost before you are aware it has
begun; and you are indebted to no one for helping you to get rid of one
vacant moment: you have had to seek no one’s company, conversation,
sympathy, forbearance; you have lived, in short, as an independent
being ought to do. Take this advice: the first and last I shall offer
you; then you will not want me or any one else, happen what may.
Neglect it—go on as heretofore, craving, whining, and idling—and suffer
the results of your idiocy, however bad and insufferable they may be. I
tell you this plainly; and listen: for though I shall no more repeat
what I am now about to say, I shall steadily act on it. After my
mother’s death, I wash my hands of you: from the day her coffin is
carried to the vault in Gateshead Church, you and I will be as separate
as if we had never known each other. You need not think that because we
chanced to be born of the same parents, I shall suffer you to fasten me
down by even the feeblest claim: I can tell you this—if the whole human
race, ourselves excepted, were swept away, and we two stood alone on
the earth, I would leave you in the old world, and betake myself to the
new.”

She closed her lips.

“You might have spared yourself the trouble of delivering that tirade,”
answered Georgiana. “Everybody knows you are the most selfish,
heartless creature in existence: and _I_ know your spiteful hatred
towards me: I have had a specimen of it before in the trick you played
me about Lord Edwin Vere: you could not bear me to be raised above you,
to have a title, to be received into circles where you dare not show
your face, and so you acted the spy and informer, and ruined my
prospects for ever.” Georgiana took out her handkerchief and blew her
nose for an hour afterwards; Eliza sat cold, impassable, and
assiduously industrious.

True, generous feeling is made small account of by some, but here were
two natures rendered, the one intolerably acrid, the other despicably
savourless for the want of it. Feeling without judgment is a washy
draught indeed; but judgment untempered by feeling is too bitter and
husky a morsel for human deglutition.

It was a wet and windy afternoon: Georgiana had fallen asleep on the
sofa over the perusal of a novel; Eliza was gone to attend a
saint’s-day service at the new church—for in matters of religion she
was a rigid formalist: no weather ever prevented the punctual discharge
of what she considered her devotional duties; fair or foul, she went to
church thrice every Sunday, and as often on week-days as there were
prayers.

I bethought myself to go upstairs and see how the dying woman sped, who
lay there almost unheeded: the very servants paid her but a remittent
attention: the hired nurse, being little looked after, would slip out
of the room whenever she could. Bessie was faithful; but she had her
own family to mind, and could only come occasionally to the hall. I
found the sick-room unwatched, as I had expected: no nurse was there;
the patient lay still, and seemingly lethargic; her livid face sunk in
the pillows: the fire was dying in the grate. I renewed the fuel,
re-arranged the bedclothes, gazed awhile on her who could not now gaze
on me, and then I moved away to the window.

The rain beat strongly against the panes, the wind blew tempestuously:
“One lies there,” I thought, “who will soon be beyond the war of
earthly elements. Whither will that spirit—now struggling to quit its
material tenement—flit when at length released?”

In pondering the great mystery, I thought of Helen Burns, recalled her
dying words—her faith—her doctrine of the equality of disembodied
souls. I was still listening in thought to her well-remembered
tones—still picturing her pale and spiritual aspect, her wasted face
and sublime gaze, as she lay on her placid deathbed, and whispered her
longing to be restored to her divine Father’s bosom—when a feeble voice
murmured from the couch behind: “Who is that?”

I knew Mrs. Reed had not spoken for days: was she reviving? I went up
to her.

“It is I, Aunt Reed.”

“Who—I?” was her answer. “Who are you?” looking at me with surprise and
a sort of alarm, but still not wildly. “You are quite a stranger to
me—where is Bessie?”

“She is at the lodge, aunt.”

“Aunt,” she repeated. “Who calls me aunt? You are not one of the
Gibsons; and yet I know you—that face, and the eyes and forehead, are
quiet familiar to me: you are like—why, you are like Jane Eyre!”

I said nothing: I was afraid of occasioning some shock by declaring my
identity.

“Yet,” said she, “I am afraid it is a mistake: my thoughts deceive me.
I wished to see Jane Eyre, and I fancy a likeness where none exists:
besides, in eight years she must be so changed.” I now gently assured
her that I was the person she supposed and desired me to be: and seeing
that I was understood, and that her senses were quite collected, I
explained how Bessie had sent her husband to fetch me from Thornfield.

“I am very ill, I know,” she said ere long. “I was trying to turn
myself a few minutes since, and find I cannot move a limb. It is as
well I should ease my mind before I die: what we think little of in
health, burdens us at such an hour as the present is to me. Is the
nurse here? or is there no one in the room but you?”

I assured her we were alone.

“Well, I have twice done you a wrong which I regret now. One was in
breaking the promise which I gave my husband to bring you up as my own
child; the other—” she stopped. “After all, it is of no great
importance, perhaps,” she murmured to herself: “and then I may get
better; and to humble myself so to her is painful.”

She made an effort to alter her position, but failed: her face changed;
she seemed to experience some inward sensation—the precursor, perhaps,
of the last pang.

“Well, I must get it over. Eternity is before me: I had better tell
her.—Go to my dressing-case, open it, and take out a letter you will
see there.”

I obeyed her directions. “Read the letter,” she said.

It was short, and thus conceived:—

“MADAM,—
“Will you have the goodness to send me the address of my niece, Jane
Eyre, and to tell me how she is? It is my intention to write shortly
and desire her to come to me at Madeira. Providence has blessed my
endeavours to secure a competency; and as I am unmarried and childless,
I wish to adopt her during my life, and bequeath her at my death
whatever I may have to leave.


I am, Madam, &c., &c.,
“JOHN EYRE, Madeira.”


It was dated three years back.

“Why did I never hear of this?” I asked.

“Because I disliked you too fixedly and thoroughly ever to lend a hand
in lifting you to prosperity. I could not forget your conduct to me,
Jane—the fury with which you once turned on me; the tone in which you
declared you abhorred me the worst of anybody in the world; the
unchildlike look and voice with which you affirmed that the very
thought of me made you sick, and asserted that I had treated you with
miserable cruelty. I could not forget my own sensations when you thus
started up and poured out the venom of your mind: I felt fear as if an
animal that I had struck or pushed had looked up at me with human eyes
and cursed me in a man’s voice.—Bring me some water! Oh, make haste!”

“Dear Mrs. Reed,” said I, as I offered her the draught she required,
“think no more of all this, let it pass away from your mind. Forgive me
for my passionate language: I was a child then; eight, nine years have
passed since that day.”

She heeded nothing of what I said; but when she had tasted the water
and drawn breath, she went on thus—

“I tell you I could not forget it; and I took my revenge: for you to be
adopted by your uncle, and placed in a state of ease and comfort, was
what I could not endure. I wrote to him; I said I was sorry for his
disappointment, but Jane Eyre was dead: she had died of typhus fever at
Lowood. Now act as you please: write and contradict my assertion—expose
my falsehood as soon as you like. You were born, I think, to be my
torment: my last hour is racked by the recollection of a deed which,
but for you, I should never have been tempted to commit.”

“If you could but be persuaded to think no more of it, aunt, and to
regard me with kindness and forgiveness——”

“You have a very bad disposition,” said she, “and one to this day I
feel it impossible to understand: how for nine years you could be
patient and quiescent under any treatment, and in the tenth break out
all fire and violence, I can never comprehend.”

“My disposition is not so bad as you think: I am passionate, but not
vindictive. Many a time, as a little child, I should have been glad to
love you if you would have let me; and I long earnestly to be
reconciled to you now: kiss me, aunt.”

I approached my cheek to her lips: she would not touch it. She said I
oppressed her by leaning over the bed, and again demanded water. As I
laid her down—for I raised her and supported her on my arm while she
drank—I covered her ice-cold and clammy hand with mine: the feeble
fingers shrank from my touch—the glazing eyes shunned my gaze.

“Love me, then, or hate me, as you will,” I said at last, “you have my
full and free forgiveness: ask now for God’s, and be at peace.”

Poor, suffering woman! it was too late for her to make now the effort
to change her habitual frame of mind: living, she had ever hated
me—dying, she must hate me still.

The nurse now entered, and Bessie followed. I yet lingered half-an-hour
longer, hoping to see some sign of amity: but she gave none. She was
fast relapsing into stupor; nor did her mind again rally: at twelve
o’clock that night she died. I was not present to close her eyes, nor
were either of her daughters. They came to tell us the next morning
that all was over. She was by that time laid out. Eliza and I went to
look at her: Georgiana, who had burst out into loud weeping, said she
dared not go. There was stretched Sarah Reed’s once robust and active
frame, rigid and still: her eye of flint was covered with its cold lid;
her brow and strong traits wore yet the impress of her inexorable soul.
A strange and solemn object was that corpse to me. I gazed on it with
gloom and pain: nothing soft, nothing sweet, nothing pitying, or
hopeful, or subduing did it inspire; only a grating anguish for _her_
woes—not _my_ loss—and a sombre tearless dismay at the fearfulness of
death in such a form.

Eliza surveyed her parent calmly. After a silence of some minutes she
observed—

“With her constitution she should have lived to a good old age: her
life was shortened by trouble.” And then a spasm constricted her mouth
for an instant: as it passed away she turned and left the room, and so
did I. Neither of us had dropt a tear.




CHAPTER XXII


Mr. Rochester had given me but one week’s leave of absence: yet a month
elapsed before I quitted Gateshead. I wished to leave immediately after
the funeral, but Georgiana entreated me to stay till she could get off
to London, whither she was now at last invited by her uncle, Mr.
Gibson, who had come down to direct his sister’s interment and settle
the family affairs. Georgiana said she dreaded being left alone with
Eliza; from her she got neither sympathy in her dejection, support in
her fears, nor aid in her preparations; so I bore with her
feeble-minded wailings and selfish lamentations as well as I could, and
did my best in sewing for her and packing her dresses. It is true, that
while I worked, she would idle; and I thought to myself, “If you and I
were destined to live always together, cousin, we would commence
matters on a different footing. I should not settle tamely down into
being the forbearing party; I should assign you your share of labour,
and compel you to accomplish it, or else it should be left undone: I
should insist, also, on your keeping some of those drawling,
half-insincere complaints hushed in your own breast. It is only because
our connection happens to be very transitory, and comes at a peculiarly
mournful season, that I consent thus to render it so patient and
compliant on my part.”

At last I saw Georgiana off; but now it was Eliza’s turn to request me
to stay another week. Her plans required all her time and attention,
she said; she was about to depart for some unknown bourne; and all day
long she stayed in her own room, her door bolted within, filling
trunks, emptying drawers, burning papers, and holding no communication
with any one. She wished me to look after the house, to see callers,
and answer notes of condolence.

One morning she told me I was at liberty. “And,” she added, “I am
obliged to you for your valuable services and discreet conduct! There
is some difference between living with such an one as you and with
Georgiana: you perform your own part in life and burden no one.
To-morrow,” she continued, “I set out for the Continent. I shall take
up my abode in a religious house near Lisle—a nunnery you would call
it; there I shall be quiet and unmolested. I shall devote myself for a
time to the examination of the Roman Catholic dogmas, and to a careful
study of the workings of their system: if I find it to be, as I half
suspect it is, the one best calculated to ensure the doing of all
things decently and in order, I shall embrace the tenets of Rome and
probably take the veil.”

I neither expressed surprise at this resolution nor attempted to
dissuade her from it. “The vocation will fit you to a hair,” I thought:
“much good may it do you!”

When we parted, she said: “Good-bye, cousin Jane Eyre; I wish you well:
you have some sense.”

I then returned: “You are not without sense, cousin Eliza; but what you
have, I suppose, in another year will be walled up alive in a French
convent. However, it is not my business, and so it suits you, I don’t
much care.”

“You are in the right,” said she; and with these words we each went our
separate way. As I shall not have occasion to refer either to her or
her sister again, I may as well mention here, that Georgiana made an
advantageous match with a wealthy worn-out man of fashion, and that
Eliza actually took the veil, and is at this day superior of the
convent where she passed the period of her novitiate, and which she
endowed with her fortune.

How people feel when they are returning home from an absence, long or
short, I did not know: I had never experienced the sensation. I had
known what it was to come back to Gateshead when a child after a long
walk, to be scolded for looking cold or gloomy; and later, what it was
to come back from church to Lowood, to long for a plenteous meal and a
good fire, and to be unable to get either. Neither of these returnings
was very pleasant or desirable: no magnet drew me to a given point,
increasing in its strength of attraction the nearer I came. The return
to Thornfield was yet to be tried.

My journey seemed tedious—very tedious: fifty miles one day, a night
spent at an inn; fifty miles the next day. During the first twelve
hours I thought of Mrs. Reed in her last moments; I saw her disfigured
and discoloured face, and heard her strangely altered voice. I mused on
the funeral day, the coffin, the hearse, the black train of tenants and
servants—few was the number of relatives—the gaping vault, the silent
church, the solemn service. Then I thought of Eliza and Georgiana; I
beheld one the cynosure of a ball-room, the other the inmate of a
convent cell; and I dwelt on and analysed their separate peculiarities
of person and character. The evening arrival at the great town of ——
scattered these thoughts; night gave them quite another turn: laid down
on my traveller’s bed, I left reminiscence for anticipation.

I was going back to Thornfield: but how long was I to stay there? Not
long; of that I was sure. I had heard from Mrs. Fairfax in the interim
of my absence: the party at the hall was dispersed; Mr. Rochester had
left for London three weeks ago, but he was then expected to return in
a fortnight. Mrs. Fairfax surmised that he was gone to make
arrangements for his wedding, as he had talked of purchasing a new
carriage: she said the idea of his marrying Miss Ingram still seemed
strange to her; but from what everybody said, and from what she had
herself seen, she could no longer doubt that the event would shortly
take place. “You would be strangely incredulous if you did doubt it,”
was my mental comment. “I don’t doubt it.”

The question followed, “Where was I to go?” I dreamt of Miss Ingram all
the night: in a vivid morning dream I saw her closing the gates of
Thornfield against me and pointing me out another road; and Mr.
Rochester looked on with his arms folded—smiling sardonically, as it
seemed, at both her and me.

I had not notified to Mrs. Fairfax the exact day of my return; for I
did not wish either car or carriage to meet me at Millcote. I proposed
to walk the distance quietly by myself; and very quietly, after leaving
my box in the ostler’s care, did I slip away from the George Inn, about
six o’clock of a June evening, and take the old road to Thornfield: a
road which lay chiefly through fields, and was now little frequented.

It was not a bright or splendid summer evening, though fair and soft:
the haymakers were at work all along the road; and the sky, though far
from cloudless, was such as promised well for the future: its
blue—where blue was visible—was mild and settled, and its cloud strata
high and thin. The west, too, was warm: no watery gleam chilled it—it
seemed as if there was a fire lit, an altar burning behind its screen
of marbled vapour, and out of apertures shone a golden redness.

I felt glad as the road shortened before me: so glad that I stopped
once to ask myself what that joy meant: and to remind reason that it
was not to my home I was going, or to a permanent resting-place, or to
a place where fond friends looked out for me and waited my arrival.
“Mrs. Fairfax will smile you a calm welcome, to be sure,” said I; “and
little Adèle will clap her hands and jump to see you: but you know very
well you are thinking of another than they, and that he is not thinking
of you.”

But what is so headstrong as youth? What so blind as inexperience?
These affirmed that it was pleasure enough to have the privilege of
again looking on Mr. Rochester, whether he looked on me or not; and
they added—“Hasten! hasten! be with him while you may: but a few more
days or weeks, at most, and you are parted from him for ever!” And then
I strangled a new-born agony—a deformed thing which I could not
persuade myself to own and rear—and ran on.

They are making hay, too, in Thornfield meadows: or rather, the
labourers are just quitting their work, and returning home with their
rakes on their shoulders, now, at the hour I arrive. I have but a field
or two to traverse, and then I shall cross the road and reach the
gates. How full the hedges are of roses! But I have no time to gather
any; I want to be at the house. I passed a tall briar, shooting leafy
and flowery branches across the path; I see the narrow stile with stone
steps; and I see—Mr. Rochester sitting there, a book and a pencil in
his hand; he is writing.

Well, he is not a ghost; yet every nerve I have is unstrung: for a
moment I am beyond my own mastery. What does it mean? I did not think I
should tremble in this way when I saw him, or lose my voice or the
power of motion in his presence. I will go back as soon as I can stir:
I need not make an absolute fool of myself. I know another way to the
house. It does not signify if I knew twenty ways; for he has seen me.

“Hillo!” he cries; and he puts up his book and his pencil. “There you
are! Come on, if you please.”

I suppose I do come on; though in what fashion I know not; being
scarcely cognisant of my movements, and solicitous only to appear calm;
and, above all, to control the working muscles of my face—which I feel
rebel insolently against my will, and struggle to express what I had
resolved to conceal. But I have a veil—it is down: I may make shift yet
to behave with decent composure.

“And this is Jane Eyre? Are you coming from Millcote, and on foot?
Yes—just one of your tricks: not to send for a carriage, and come
clattering over street and road like a common mortal, but to steal into
the vicinage of your home along with twilight, just as if you were a
dream or a shade. What the deuce have you done with yourself this last
month?”

“I have been with my aunt, sir, who is dead.”

“A true Janian reply! Good angels be my guard! She comes from the other
world—from the abode of people who are dead; and tells me so when she
meets me alone here in the gloaming! If I dared, I’d touch you, to see
if you are substance or shadow, you elf!—but I’d as soon offer to take
hold of a blue _ignis fatuus_ light in a marsh. Truant! truant!” he
added, when he had paused an instant. “Absent from me a whole month,
and forgetting me quite, I’ll be sworn!”

I knew there would be pleasure in meeting my master again, even though
broken by the fear that he was so soon to cease to be my master, and by
the knowledge that I was nothing to him: but there was ever in Mr.
Rochester (so at least I thought) such a wealth of the power of
communicating happiness, that to taste but of the crumbs he scattered
to stray and stranger birds like me, was to feast genially. His last
words were balm: they seemed to imply that it imported something to him
whether I forgot him or not. And he had spoken of Thornfield as my
home—would that it were my home!

He did not leave the stile, and I hardly liked to ask to go by. I
inquired soon if he had not been to London.

“Yes; I suppose you found that out by second-sight.”

“Mrs. Fairfax told me in a letter.”

“And did she inform you what I went to do?”

“Oh, yes, sir! Everybody knew your errand.”

“You must see the carriage, Jane, and tell me if you don’t think it
will suit Mrs. Rochester exactly; and whether she won’t look like Queen
Boadicea, leaning back against those purple cushions. I wish, Jane, I
were a trifle better adapted to match with her externally. Tell me now,
fairy as you are—can’t you give me a charm, or a philter, or something
of that sort, to make me a handsome man?”

“It would be past the power of magic, sir;” and, in thought, I added,
“A loving eye is all the charm needed: to such you are handsome enough;
or rather your sternness has a power beyond beauty.”

Mr. Rochester had sometimes read my unspoken thoughts with an acumen to
me incomprehensible: in the present instance he took no notice of my
abrupt vocal response; but he smiled at me with a certain smile he had
of his own, and which he used but on rare occasions. He seemed to think
it too good for common purposes: it was the real sunshine of feeling—he
shed it over me now.

“Pass, Janet,” said he, making room for me to cross the stile: “go up
home, and stay your weary little wandering feet at a friend’s
threshold.”

All I had now to do was to obey him in silence: no need for me to
colloquise further. I got over the stile without a word, and meant to
leave him calmly. An impulse held me fast—a force turned me round. I
said—or something in me said for me, and in spite of me—

“Thank you, Mr. Rochester, for your great kindness. I am strangely glad
to get back again to you: and wherever you are is my home—my only
home.”

I walked on so fast that even he could hardly have overtaken me had he
tried. Little Adèle was half wild with delight when she saw me. Mrs.
Fairfax received me with her usual plain friendliness. Leah smiled, and
even Sophie bid me “bon soir” with glee. This was very pleasant; there
is no happiness like that of being loved by your fellow-creatures, and
feeling that your presence is an addition to their comfort.

I that evening shut my eyes resolutely against the future: I stopped my
ears against the voice that kept warning me of near separation and
coming grief. When tea was over and Mrs. Fairfax had taken her
knitting, and I had assumed a low seat near her, and Adèle, kneeling on
the carpet, had nestled close up to me, and a sense of mutual affection
seemed to surround us with a ring of golden peace, I uttered a silent
prayer that we might not be parted far or soon; but when, as we thus
sat, Mr. Rochester entered, unannounced, and looking at us, seemed to
take pleasure in the spectacle of a group so amicable—when he said he
supposed the old lady was all right now that she had got her adopted
daughter back again, and added that he saw Adèle was “prête à croquer
sa petite maman Anglaise”—I half ventured to hope that he would, even
after his marriage, keep us together somewhere under the shelter of his
protection, and not quite exiled from the sunshine of his presence.

A fortnight of dubious calm succeeded my return to Thornfield Hall.
Nothing was said of the master’s marriage, and I saw no preparation
going on for such an event. Almost every day I asked Mrs. Fairfax if
she had yet heard anything decided: her answer was always in the
negative. Once she said she had actually put the question to Mr.
Rochester as to when he was going to bring his bride home; but he had
answered her only by a joke and one of his queer looks, and she could
not tell what to make of him.

One thing specially surprised me, and that was, there were no
journeyings backward and forward, no visits to Ingram Park: to be sure
it was twenty miles off, on the borders of another county; but what was
that distance to an ardent lover? To so practised and indefatigable a
horseman as Mr. Rochester, it would be but a morning’s ride. I began to
cherish hopes I had no right to conceive: that the match was broken
off; that rumour had been mistaken; that one or both parties had
changed their minds. I used to look at my master’s face to see if it
were sad or fierce; but I could not remember the time when it had been
so uniformly clear of clouds or evil feelings. If, in the moments I and
my pupil spent with him, I lacked spirits and sank into inevitable
dejection, he became even gay. Never had he called me more frequently
to his presence; never been kinder to me when there—and, alas! never
had I loved him so well.




CHAPTER XXIII


A splendid Midsummer shone over England: skies so pure, suns so radiant
as were then seen in long succession, seldom favour even singly, our
wave-girt land. It was as if a band of Italian days had come from the
South, like a flock of glorious passenger birds, and lighted to rest
them on the cliffs of Albion. The hay was all got in; the fields round
Thornfield were green and shorn; the roads white and baked; the trees
were in their dark prime; hedge and wood, full-leaved and deeply
tinted, contrasted well with the sunny hue of the cleared meadows
between.

On Midsummer-eve, Adèle, weary with gathering wild strawberries in Hay
Lane half the day, had gone to bed with the sun. I watched her drop
asleep, and when I left her, I sought the garden.

It was now the sweetest hour of the twenty-four:—“Day its fervid fires
had wasted,” and dew fell cool on panting plain and scorched summit.
Where the sun had gone down in simple state—pure of the pomp of
clouds—spread a solemn purple, burning with the light of red jewel and
furnace flame at one point, on one hill-peak, and extending high and
wide, soft and still softer, over half heaven. The east had its own
charm or fine deep blue, and its own modest gem, a rising and solitary
star: soon it would boast the moon; but she was yet beneath the
horizon.

I walked a while on the pavement; but a subtle, well-known scent—that
of a cigar—stole from some window; I saw the library casement open a
handbreadth; I knew I might be watched thence; so I went apart into the
orchard. No nook in the grounds more sheltered and more Eden-like; it
was full of trees, it bloomed with flowers: a very high wall shut it
out from the court, on one side; on the other, a beech avenue screened
it from the lawn. At the bottom was a sunk fence; its sole separation
from lonely fields: a winding walk, bordered with laurels and
terminating in a giant horse-chestnut, circled at the base by a seat,
led down to the fence. Here one could wander unseen. While such
honey-dew fell, such silence reigned, such gloaming gathered, I felt as
if I could haunt such shade for ever; but in threading the flower and
fruit parterres at the upper part of the enclosure, enticed there by
the light the now rising moon cast on this more open quarter, my step
is stayed—not by sound, not by sight, but once more by a warning
fragrance.

Sweet-briar and southernwood, jasmine, pink, and rose have long been
yielding their evening sacrifice of incense: this new scent is neither
of shrub nor flower; it is—I know it well—it is Mr. Rochester’s cigar.
I look round and I listen. I see trees laden with ripening fruit. I
hear a nightingale warbling in a wood half a mile off; no moving form
is visible, no coming step audible; but that perfume increases: I must
flee. I make for the wicket leading to the shrubbery, and I see Mr.
Rochester entering. I step aside into the ivy recess; he will not stay
long: he will soon return whence he came, and if I sit still he will
never see me.

But no—eventide is as pleasant to him as to me, and this antique garden
as attractive; and he strolls on, now lifting the gooseberry-tree
branches to look at the fruit, large as plums, with which they are
laden; now taking a ripe cherry from the wall; now stooping towards a
knot of flowers, either to inhale their fragrance or to admire the
dew-beads on their petals. A great moth goes humming by me; it alights
on a plant at Mr. Rochester’s foot: he sees it, and bends to examine
it.

“Now, he has his back towards me,” thought I, “and he is occupied too;
perhaps, if I walk softly, I can slip away unnoticed.”

I trode on an edging of turf that the crackle of the pebbly gravel
might not betray me: he was standing among the beds at a yard or two
distant from where I had to pass; the moth apparently engaged him. “I
shall get by very well,” I meditated. As I crossed his shadow, thrown
long over the garden by the moon, not yet risen high, he said quietly,
without turning—

“Jane, come and look at this fellow.”

I had made no noise: he had not eyes behind—could his shadow feel? I
started at first, and then I approached him.

“Look at his wings,” said he, “he reminds me rather of a West Indian
insect; one does not often see so large and gay a night-rover in
England; there! he is flown.”

The moth roamed away. I was sheepishly retreating also; but Mr.
Rochester followed me, and when we reached the wicket, he said—

“Turn back: on so lovely a night it is a shame to sit in the house; and
surely no one can wish to go to bed while sunset is thus at meeting
with moonrise.”

It is one of my faults, that though my tongue is sometimes prompt
enough at an answer, there are times when it sadly fails me in framing
an excuse; and always the lapse occurs at some crisis, when a facile
word or plausible pretext is specially wanted to get me out of painful
embarrassment. I did not like to walk at this hour alone with Mr.
Rochester in the shadowy orchard; but I could not find a reason to
allege for leaving him. I followed with lagging step, and thoughts
busily bent on discovering a means of extrication; but he himself
looked so composed and so grave also, I became ashamed of feeling any
confusion: the evil—if evil existent or prospective there was—seemed to
lie with me only; his mind was unconscious and quiet.

“Jane,” he recommenced, as we entered the laurel walk, and slowly
strayed down in the direction of the sunk fence and the horse-chestnut,
“Thornfield is a pleasant place in summer, is it not?”

“Yes, sir.”

“You must have become in some degree attached to the house,—you, who
have an eye for natural beauties, and a good deal of the organ of
Adhesiveness?”

“I am attached to it, indeed.”

“And though I don’t comprehend how it is, I perceive you have acquired
a degree of regard for that foolish little child Adèle, too; and even
for simple dame Fairfax?”

“Yes, sir; in different ways, I have an affection for both.”

“And would be sorry to part with them?”

“Yes.”

“Pity!” he said, and sighed and paused. “It is always the way of events
in this life,” he continued presently: “no sooner have you got settled
in a pleasant resting-place, than a voice calls out to you to rise and
move on, for the hour of repose is expired.”

“Must I move on, sir?” I asked. “Must I leave Thornfield?”

“I believe you must, Jane. I am sorry, Janet, but I believe indeed you
must.”

This was a blow: but I did not let it prostrate me.

“Well, sir, I shall be ready when the order to march comes.”

“It is come now—I must give it to-night.”

“Then you _are_ going to be married, sir?”

“Ex-act-ly—pre-cise-ly: with your usual acuteness, you have hit the
nail straight on the head.”

“Soon, sir?”

“Very soon, my—that is, Miss Eyre: and you’ll remember, Jane, the first
time I, or Rumour, plainly intimated to you that it was my intention to
put my old bachelor’s neck into the sacred noose, to enter into the
holy estate of matrimony—to take Miss Ingram to my bosom, in short
(she’s an extensive armful: but that’s not to the point—one can’t have
too much of such a very excellent thing as my beautiful Blanche): well,
as I was saying—listen to me, Jane! You’re not turning your head to
look after more moths, are you? That was only a lady-clock, child,
‘flying away home.’ I wish to remind you that it was you who first said
to me, with that discretion I respect in you—with that foresight,
prudence, and humility which befit your responsible and dependent
position—that in case I married Miss Ingram, both you and little Adèle
had better trot forthwith. I pass over the sort of slur conveyed in
this suggestion on the character of my beloved; indeed, when you are
far away, Janet, I’ll try to forget it: I shall notice only its wisdom;
which is such that I have made it my law of action. Adèle must go to
school; and you, Miss Eyre, must get a new situation.”

“Yes, sir, I will advertise immediately: and meantime, I suppose—” I
was going to say, “I suppose I may stay here, till I find another
shelter to betake myself to:” but I stopped, feeling it would not do to
risk a long sentence, for my voice was not quite under command.

“In about a month I hope to be a bridegroom,” continued Mr. Rochester;
“and in the interim, I shall myself look out for employment and an
asylum for you.”

“Thank you, sir; I am sorry to give—”

“Oh, no need to apologise! I consider that when a dependent does her
duty as well as you have done yours, she has a sort of claim upon her
employer for any little assistance he can conveniently render her;
indeed I have already, through my future mother-in-law, heard of a
place that I think will suit: it is to undertake the education of the
five daughters of Mrs. Dionysius O’Gall of Bitternutt Lodge, Connaught,
Ireland. You’ll like Ireland, I think: they’re such warm-hearted people
there, they say.”

“It is a long way off, sir.”

“No matter—a girl of your sense will not object to the voyage or the
distance.”

“Not the voyage, but the distance: and then the sea is a barrier—”

“From what, Jane?”

“From England and from Thornfield: and—”

“Well?”

“From _you_, sir.”

I said this almost involuntarily, and, with as little sanction of free
will, my tears gushed out. I did not cry so as to be heard, however; I
avoided sobbing. The thought of Mrs. O’Gall and Bitternutt Lodge struck
cold to my heart; and colder the thought of all the brine and foam,
destined, as it seemed, to rush between me and the master at whose side
I now walked, and coldest the remembrance of the wider ocean—wealth,
caste, custom intervened between me and what I naturally and inevitably
loved.

“It is a long way,” I again said.

“It is, to be sure; and when you get to Bitternutt Lodge, Connaught,
Ireland, I shall never see you again, Jane: that’s morally certain. I
never go over to Ireland, not having myself much of a fancy for the
country. We have been good friends, Jane; have we not?”

“Yes, sir.”

“And when friends are on the eve of separation, they like to spend the
little time that remains to them close to each other. Come! we’ll talk
over the voyage and the parting quietly half-an-hour or so, while the
stars enter into their shining life up in heaven yonder: here is the
chestnut tree: here is the bench at its old roots. Come, we will sit
there in peace to-night, though we should never more be destined to sit
there together.” He seated me and himself.

“It is a long way to Ireland, Janet, and I am sorry to send my little
friend on such weary travels: but if I can’t do better, how is it to be
helped? Are you anything akin to me, do you think, Jane?”

I could risk no sort of answer by this time: my heart was still.

“Because,” he said, “I sometimes have a queer feeling with regard to
you—especially when you are near me, as now: it is as if I had a string
somewhere under my left ribs, tightly and inextricably knotted to a
similar string situated in the corresponding quarter of your little
frame. And if that boisterous Channel, and two hundred miles or so of
land come broad between us, I am afraid that cord of communion will be
snapt; and then I’ve a nervous notion I should take to bleeding
inwardly. As for you,—you’d forget me.”

“That I _never_ should, sir: you know—” Impossible to proceed.

“Jane, do you hear that nightingale singing in the wood? Listen!”

In listening, I sobbed convulsively; for I could repress what I endured
no longer; I was obliged to yield, and I was shaken from head to foot
with acute distress. When I did speak, it was only to express an
impetuous wish that I had never been born, or never come to Thornfield.

“Because you are sorry to leave it?”

The vehemence of emotion, stirred by grief and love within me, was
claiming mastery, and struggling for full sway, and asserting a right
to predominate, to overcome, to live, rise, and reign at last: yes,—and
to speak.

“I grieve to leave Thornfield: I love Thornfield:—I love it, because I
have lived in it a full and delightful life,—momentarily at least. I
have not been trampled on. I have not been petrified. I have not been
buried with inferior minds, and excluded from every glimpse of
communion with what is bright and energetic and high. I have talked,
face to face, with what I reverence, with what I delight in,—with an
original, a vigorous, an expanded mind. I have known you, Mr.
Rochester; and it strikes me with terror and anguish to feel I
absolutely must be torn from you for ever. I see the necessity of
departure; and it is like looking on the necessity of death.”

“Where do you see the necessity?” he asked suddenly.

“Where? You, sir, have placed it before me.”

“In what shape?”

“In the shape of Miss Ingram; a noble and beautiful woman,—your bride.”

“My bride! What bride? I have no bride!”

“But you will have.”

“Yes;—I will!—I will!” He set his teeth.

“Then I must go:—you have said it yourself.”

“No: you must stay! I swear it—and the oath shall be kept.”

“I tell you I must go!” I retorted, roused to something like passion.
“Do you think I can stay to become nothing to you? Do you think I am an
automaton?—a machine without feelings? and can bear to have my morsel
of bread snatched from my lips, and my drop of living water dashed from
my cup? Do you think, because I am poor, obscure, plain, and little, I
am soulless and heartless? You think wrong!—I have as much soul as
you,—and full as much heart! And if God had gifted me with some beauty
and much wealth, I should have made it as hard for you to leave me, as
it is now for me to leave you. I am not talking to you now through the
medium of custom, conventionalities, nor even of mortal flesh;—it is my
spirit that addresses your spirit; just as if both had passed through
the grave, and we stood at God’s feet, equal,—as we are!”

“As we are!” repeated Mr. Rochester—“so,” he added, enclosing me in his
arms, gathering me to his breast, pressing his lips on my lips: “so,
Jane!”

“Yes, so, sir,” I rejoined: “and yet not so; for you are a married
man—or as good as a married man, and wed to one inferior to you—to one
with whom you have no sympathy—whom I do not believe you truly love;
for I have seen and heard you sneer at her. I would scorn such a union:
therefore I am better than you—let me go!”

“Where, Jane? To Ireland?”

“Yes—to Ireland. I have spoken my mind, and can go anywhere now.”

“Jane, be still; don’t struggle so, like a wild frantic bird that is
rending its own plumage in its desperation.”

“I am no bird; and no net ensnares me; I am a free human being with an
independent will, which I now exert to leave you.”

Another effort set me at liberty, and I stood erect before him.

“And your will shall decide your destiny,” he said: “I offer you my
hand, my heart, and a share of all my possessions.”

“You play a farce, which I merely laugh at.”

“I ask you to pass through life at my side—to be my second self, and
best earthly companion.”

“For that fate you have already made your choice, and must abide by
it.”

“Jane, be still a few moments: you are over-excited: I will be still
too.”

A waft of wind came sweeping down the laurel-walk, and trembled through
the boughs of the chestnut: it wandered away—away—to an indefinite
distance—it died. The nightingale’s song was then the only voice of the
hour: in listening to it, I again wept. Mr. Rochester sat quiet,
looking at me gently and seriously. Some time passed before he spoke;
he at last said—

“Come to my side, Jane, and let us explain and understand one another.”

“I will never again come to your side: I am torn away now, and cannot
return.”

“But, Jane, I summon you as my wife: it is you only I intend to marry.”

I was silent: I thought he mocked me.

“Come, Jane—come hither.”

“Your bride stands between us.”

He rose, and with a stride reached me.

“My bride is here,” he said, again drawing me to him, “because my equal
is here, and my likeness. Jane, will you marry me?”

Still I did not answer, and still I writhed myself from his grasp: for
I was still incredulous.

“Do you doubt me, Jane?”

“Entirely.”

“You have no faith in me?”

“Not a whit.”

“Am I a liar in your eyes?” he asked passionately. “Little sceptic, you
_shall_ be convinced. What love have I for Miss Ingram? None: and that
you know. What love has she for me? None: as I have taken pains to
prove: I caused a rumour to reach her that my fortune was not a third
of what was supposed, and after that I presented myself to see the
result; it was coldness both from her and her mother. I would not—I
could not—marry Miss Ingram. You—you strange, you almost unearthly
thing!—I love as my own flesh. You—poor and obscure, and small and
plain as you are—I entreat to accept me as a husband.”

“What, me!” I ejaculated, beginning in his earnestness—and especially
in his incivility—to credit his sincerity: “me who have not a friend in
the world but you—if you are my friend: not a shilling but what you
have given me?”

“You, Jane, I must have you for my own—entirely my own. Will you be
mine? Say yes, quickly.”

“Mr. Rochester, let me look at your face: turn to the moonlight.”

“Why?”

“Because I want to read your countenance—turn!”

“There! you will find it scarcely more legible than a crumpled,
scratched page. Read on: only make haste, for I suffer.”

His face was very much agitated and very much flushed, and there were
strong workings in the features, and strange gleams in the eyes.

“Oh, Jane, you torture me!” he exclaimed. “With that searching and yet
faithful and generous look, you torture me!”

“How can I do that? If you are true, and your offer real, my only
feelings to you must be gratitude and devotion—they cannot torture.”

“Gratitude!” he ejaculated; and added wildly—“Jane accept me quickly.
Say, Edward—give me my name—Edward—I will marry you.”

“Are you in earnest? Do you truly love me? Do you sincerely wish me to
be your wife?”

“I do; and if an oath is necessary to satisfy you, I swear it.”

“Then, sir, I will marry you.”

“Edward—my little wife!”

“Dear Edward!”

“Come to me—come to me entirely now,” said he; and added, in his
deepest tone, speaking in my ear as his cheek was laid on mine, “Make
my happiness—I will make yours.”

“God pardon me!” he subjoined ere long; “and man meddle not with me: I
have her, and will hold her.”

“There is no one to meddle, sir. I have no kindred to interfere.”

“No—that is the best of it,” he said. And if I had loved him less I
should have thought his accent and look of exultation savage; but,
sitting by him, roused from the nightmare of parting—called to the
paradise of union—I thought only of the bliss given me to drink in so
abundant a flow. Again and again he said, “Are you happy, Jane?” And
again and again I answered, “Yes.” After which he murmured, “It will
atone—it will atone. Have I not found her friendless, and cold, and
comfortless? Will I not guard, and cherish, and solace her? Is there
not love in my heart, and constancy in my resolves? It will expiate at
God’s tribunal. I know my Maker sanctions what I do. For the world’s
judgment—I wash my hands thereof. For man’s opinion—I defy it.”

But what had befallen the night? The moon was not yet set, and we were
all in shadow: I could scarcely see my master’s face, near as I was.
And what ailed the chestnut tree? it writhed and groaned; while wind
roared in the laurel walk, and came sweeping over us.

“We must go in,” said Mr. Rochester: “the weather changes. I could have
sat with thee till morning, Jane.”

“And so,” thought I, “could I with you.” I should have said so,
perhaps, but a livid, vivid spark leapt out of a cloud at which I was
looking, and there was a crack, a crash, and a close rattling peal; and
I thought only of hiding my dazzled eyes against Mr. Rochester’s
shoulder.

The rain rushed down. He hurried me up the walk, through the grounds,
and into the house; but we were quite wet before we could pass the
threshold. He was taking off my shawl in the hall, and shaking the
water out of my loosened hair, when Mrs. Fairfax emerged from her room.
I did not observe her at first, nor did Mr. Rochester. The lamp was
lit. The clock was on the stroke of twelve.

“Hasten to take off your wet things,” said he; “and before you go,
good-night—good-night, my darling!”

He kissed me repeatedly. When I looked up, on leaving his arms, there
stood the widow, pale, grave, and amazed. I only smiled at her, and ran
upstairs. “Explanation will do for another time,” thought I. Still,
when I reached my chamber, I felt a pang at the idea she should even
temporarily misconstrue what she had seen. But joy soon effaced every
other feeling; and loud as the wind blew, near and deep as the thunder
crashed, fierce and frequent as the lightning gleamed, cataract-like as
the rain fell during a storm of two hours’ duration, I experienced no
fear and little awe. Mr. Rochester came thrice to my door in the course
of it, to ask if I was safe and tranquil: and that was comfort, that
was strength for anything.

Before I left my bed in the morning, little Adèle came running in to
tell me that the great horse-chestnut at the bottom of the orchard had
been struck by lightning in the night, and half of it split away.




CHAPTER XXIV


As I rose and dressed, I thought over what had happened, and wondered
if it were a dream. I could not be certain of the reality till I had
seen Mr. Rochester again, and heard him renew his words of love and
promise.

While arranging my hair, I looked at my face in the glass, and felt it
was no longer plain: there was hope in its aspect and life in its
colour; and my eyes seemed as if they had beheld the fount of fruition,
and borrowed beams from the lustrous ripple. I had often been unwilling
to look at my master, because I feared he could not be pleased at my
look; but I was sure I might lift my face to his now, and not cool his
affection by its expression. I took a plain but clean and light summer
dress from my drawer and put it on: it seemed no attire had ever so
well become me, because none had I ever worn in so blissful a mood.

I was not surprised, when I ran down into the hall, to see that a
brilliant June morning had succeeded to the tempest of the night; and
to feel, through the open glass door, the breathing of a fresh and
fragrant breeze. Nature must be gladsome when I was so happy. A
beggar-woman and her little boy—pale, ragged objects both—were coming
up the walk, and I ran down and gave them all the money I happened to
have in my purse—some three or four shillings: good or bad, they must
partake of my jubilee. The rooks cawed, and blither birds sang; but
nothing was so merry or so musical as my own rejoicing heart.

Mrs. Fairfax surprised me by looking out of the window with a sad
countenance, and saying gravely—“Miss Eyre, will you come to
breakfast?” During the meal she was quiet and cool: but I could not
undeceive her then. I must wait for my master to give explanations; and
so must she. I ate what I could, and then I hastened upstairs. I met
Adèle leaving the schoolroom.

“Where are you going? It is time for lessons.”

“Mr. Rochester has sent me away to the nursery.”

“Where is he?”

“In there,” pointing to the apartment she had left; and I went in, and
there he stood.

“Come and bid me good-morning,” said he. I gladly advanced; and it was
not merely a cold word now, or even a shake of the hand that I
received, but an embrace and a kiss. It seemed natural: it seemed
genial to be so well loved, so caressed by him.

“Jane, you look blooming, and smiling, and pretty,” said he: “truly
pretty this morning. Is this my pale, little elf? Is this my
mustard-seed? This little sunny-faced girl with the dimpled cheek and
rosy lips; the satin-smooth hazel hair, and the radiant hazel eyes?” (I
had green eyes, reader; but you must excuse the mistake: for him they
were new-dyed, I suppose.)

“It is Jane Eyre, sir.”

“Soon to be Jane Rochester,” he added: “in four weeks, Janet; not a day
more. Do you hear that?”

I did, and I could not quite comprehend it: it made me giddy. The
feeling, the announcement sent through me, was something stronger than
was consistent with joy—something that smote and stunned: it was, I
think almost fear.

“You blushed, and now you are white, Jane: what is that for?”

“Because you gave me a new name—Jane Rochester; and it seems so
strange.”

“Yes, Mrs. Rochester,” said he; “young Mrs. Rochester—Fairfax
Rochester’s girl-bride.”

“It can never be, sir; it does not sound likely. Human beings never
enjoy complete happiness in this world. I was not born for a different
destiny to the rest of my species: to imagine such a lot befalling me
is a fairy tale—a day-dream.”

“Which I can and will realise. I shall begin to-day. This morning I
wrote to my banker in London to send me certain jewels he has in his
keeping,—heirlooms for the ladies of Thornfield. In a day or two I hope
to pour them into your lap: for every privilege, every attention shall
be yours that I would accord a peer’s daughter, if about to marry her.”

“Oh, sir!—never rain jewels! I don’t like to hear them spoken of.
Jewels for Jane Eyre sounds unnatural and strange: I would rather not
have them.”

“I will myself put the diamond chain round your neck, and the circlet
on your forehead,—which it will become: for nature, at least, has
stamped her patent of nobility on this brow, Jane; and I will clasp the
bracelets on these fine wrists, and load these fairy-like fingers with
rings.”

“No, no, sir! think of other subjects, and speak of other things, and
in another strain. Don’t address me as if I were a beauty; I am your
plain, Quakerish governess.”

“You are a beauty in my eyes, and a beauty just after the desire of my
heart,—delicate and aërial.”

“Puny and insignificant, you mean. You are dreaming, sir,—or you are
sneering. For God’s sake, don’t be ironical!”

“I will make the world acknowledge you a beauty, too,” he went on,
while I really became uneasy at the strain he had adopted, because I
felt he was either deluding himself or trying to delude me. “I will
attire my Jane in satin and lace, and she shall have roses in her hair;
and I will cover the head I love best with a priceless veil.”

“And then you won’t know me, sir; and I shall not be your Jane Eyre any
longer, but an ape in a harlequin’s jacket—a jay in borrowed plumes. I
would as soon see you, Mr. Rochester, tricked out in stage-trappings,
as myself clad in a court-lady’s robe; and I don’t call you handsome,
sir, though I love you most dearly: far too dearly to flatter you.
Don’t flatter me.”

He pursued his theme, however, without noticing my deprecation. “This
very day I shall take you in the carriage to Millcote, and you must
choose some dresses for yourself. I told you we shall be married in
four weeks. The wedding is to take place quietly, in the church down
below yonder; and then I shall waft you away at once to town. After a
brief stay there, I shall bear my treasure to regions nearer the sun:
to French vineyards and Italian plains; and she shall see whatever is
famous in old story and in modern record: she shall taste, too, of the
life of cities; and she shall learn to value herself by just comparison
with others.”

“Shall I travel?—and with you, sir?”

“You shall sojourn at Paris, Rome, and Naples: at Florence, Venice, and
Vienna: all the ground I have wandered over shall be re-trodden by you:
wherever I stamped my hoof, your sylph’s foot shall step also. Ten
years since, I flew through Europe half mad; with disgust, hate, and
rage as my companions: now I shall revisit it healed and cleansed, with
a very angel as my comforter.”

I laughed at him as he said this. “I am not an angel,” I asserted; “and
I will not be one till I die: I will be myself. Mr. Rochester, you must
neither expect nor exact anything celestial of me—for you will not get
it, any more than I shall get it of you: which I do not at all
anticipate.”

“What do you anticipate of me?”

“For a little while you will perhaps be as you are now,—a very little
while; and then you will turn cool; and then you will be capricious;
and then you will be stern, and I shall have much ado to please you:
but when you get well used to me, you will perhaps like me
again,—_like_ me, I say, not _love_ me. I suppose your love will
effervesce in six months, or less. I have observed in books written by
men, that period assigned as the farthest to which a husband’s ardour
extends. Yet, after all, as a friend and companion, I hope never to
become quite distasteful to my dear master.”

“Distasteful! and like you again! I think I shall like you again, and
yet again: and I will make you confess I do not only _like_, but _love_
you—with truth, fervour, constancy.”

“Yet are you not capricious, sir?”

“To women who please me only by their faces, I am the very devil when I
find out they have neither souls nor hearts—when they open to me a
perspective of flatness, triviality, and perhaps imbecility,
coarseness, and ill-temper: but to the clear eye and eloquent tongue,
to the soul made of fire, and the character that bends but does not
break—at once supple and stable, tractable and consistent—I am ever
tender and true.”

“Had you ever experience of such a character, sir? Did you ever love
such an one?”

“I love it now.”

“But before me: if I, indeed, in any respect come up to your difficult
standard?”

“I never met your likeness. Jane, you please me, and you master me—you
seem to submit, and I like the sense of pliancy you impart; and while I
am twining the soft, silken skein round my finger, it sends a thrill up
my arm to my heart. I am influenced—conquered; and the influence is
sweeter than I can express; and the conquest I undergo has a witchery
beyond any triumph I can win. Why do you smile, Jane? What does that
inexplicable, that uncanny turn of countenance mean?”

“I was thinking, sir (you will excuse the idea; it was involuntary), I
was thinking of Hercules and Samson with their charmers—”

“You were, you little elfish—”

“Hush, sir! You don’t talk very wisely just now; any more than those
gentlemen acted very wisely. However, had they been married, they would
no doubt by their severity as husbands have made up for their softness
as suitors; and so will you, I fear. I wonder how you will answer me a
year hence, should I ask a favour it does not suit your convenience or
pleasure to grant.”

“Ask me something now, Janet,—the least thing: I desire to be
entreated—”

“Indeed I will, sir; I have my petition all ready.”

“Speak! But if you look up and smile with that countenance, I shall
swear concession before I know to what, and that will make a fool of
me.”

“Not at all, sir; I ask only this: don’t send for the jewels, and don’t
crown me with roses: you might as well put a border of gold lace round
that plain pocket handkerchief you have there.”

“I might as well ‘gild refined gold.’ I know it: your request is
granted then—for the time. I will remand the order I despatched to my
banker. But you have not yet asked for anything; you have prayed a gift
to be withdrawn: try again.”

“Well then, sir, have the goodness to gratify my curiosity, which is
much piqued on one point.”

He looked disturbed. “What? what?” he said hastily. “Curiosity is a
dangerous petition: it is well I have not taken a vow to accord every
request—”

“But there can be no danger in complying with this, sir.”

“Utter it, Jane: but I wish that instead of a mere inquiry into,
perhaps, a secret, it was a wish for half my estate.”

“Now, King Ahasuerus! What do I want with half your estate? Do you
think I am a Jew-usurer, seeking good investment in land? I would much
rather have all your confidence. You will not exclude me from your
confidence if you admit me to your heart?”

“You are welcome to all my confidence that is worth having, Jane; but
for God’s sake, don’t desire a useless burden! Don’t long for
poison—don’t turn out a downright Eve on my hands!”

“Why not, sir? You have just been telling me how much you liked to be
conquered, and how pleasant over-persuasion is to you. Don’t you think
I had better take advantage of the confession, and begin and coax and
entreat—even cry and be sulky if necessary—for the sake of a mere essay
of my power?”

“I dare you to any such experiment. Encroach, presume, and the game is
up.”

“Is it, sir? You soon give in. How stern you look now! Your eyebrows
have become as thick as my finger, and your forehead resembles what, in
some very astonishing poetry, I once saw styled, ‘a blue-piled
thunderloft.’ That will be your married look, sir, I suppose?”

“If that will be _your_ married look, I, as a Christian, will soon give
up the notion of consorting with a mere sprite or salamander. But what
had you to ask, thing,—out with it?”

“There, you are less than civil now; and I like rudeness a great deal
better than flattery. I had rather be a _thing_ than an angel. This is
what I have to ask,—Why did you take such pains to make me believe you
wished to marry Miss Ingram?”

“Is that all? Thank God it is no worse!” And now he unknit his black
brows; looked down, smiling at me, and stroked my hair, as if well
pleased at seeing a danger averted. “I think I may confess,” he
continued, “even although I should make you a little indignant,
Jane—and I have seen what a fire-spirit you can be when you are
indignant. You glowed in the cool moonlight last night, when you
mutinied against fate, and claimed your rank as my equal. Janet,
by-the-bye, it was you who made me the offer.”

“Of course I did. But to the point if you please, sir—Miss Ingram?”

“Well, I feigned courtship of Miss Ingram, because I wished to render
you as madly in love with me as I was with you; and I knew jealousy
would be the best ally I could call in for the furtherance of that
end.”

“Excellent! Now you are small—not one whit bigger than the end of my
little finger. It was a burning shame and a scandalous disgrace to act
in that way. Did you think nothing of Miss Ingram’s feelings, sir?”

“Her feelings are concentrated in one—pride; and that needs humbling.
Were you jealous, Jane?”

“Never mind, Mr. Rochester: it is in no way interesting to you to know
that. Answer me truly once more. Do you think Miss Ingram will not
suffer from your dishonest coquetry? Won’t she feel forsaken and
deserted?”

“Impossible!—when I told you how she, on the contrary, deserted me: the
idea of my insolvency cooled, or rather extinguished, her flame in a
moment.”

“You have a curious, designing mind, Mr. Rochester. I am afraid your
principles on some points are eccentric.”

“My principles were never trained, Jane: they may have grown a little
awry for want of attention.”

“Once again, seriously; may I enjoy the great good that has been
vouchsafed to me, without fearing that any one else is suffering the
bitter pain I myself felt a while ago?”

“That you may, my good little girl: there is not another being in the
world has the same pure love for me as yourself—for I lay that pleasant
unction to my soul, Jane, a belief in your affection.”

I turned my lips to the hand that lay on my shoulder. I loved him very
much—more than I could trust myself to say—more than words had power to
express.

“Ask something more,” he said presently; “it is my delight to be
entreated, and to yield.”

I was again ready with my request. “Communicate your intentions to Mrs.
Fairfax, sir: she saw me with you last night in the hall, and she was
shocked. Give her some explanation before I see her again. It pains me
to be misjudged by so good a woman.”

“Go to your room, and put on your bonnet,” he replied. “I mean you to
accompany me to Millcote this morning; and while you prepare for the
drive, I will enlighten the old lady’s understanding. Did she think,
Janet, you had given the world for love, and considered it well lost?”

“I believe she thought I had forgotten my station, and yours, sir.”

“Station! station!—your station is in my heart, and on the necks of
those who would insult you, now or hereafter.—Go.”

I was soon dressed; and when I heard Mr. Rochester quit Mrs. Fairfax’s
parlour, I hurried down to it. The old lady had been reading her
morning portion of Scripture—the Lesson for the day; her Bible lay open
before her, and her spectacles were upon it. Her occupation, suspended
by Mr. Rochester’s announcement, seemed now forgotten: her eyes, fixed
on the blank wall opposite, expressed the surprise of a quiet mind
stirred by unwonted tidings. Seeing me, she roused herself: she made a
sort of effort to smile, and framed a few words of congratulation; but
the smile expired, and the sentence was abandoned unfinished. She put
up her spectacles, shut the Bible, and pushed her chair back from the
table.

“I feel so astonished,” she began, “I hardly know what to say to you,
Miss Eyre. I have surely not been dreaming, have I? Sometimes I half
fall asleep when I am sitting alone and fancy things that have never
happened. It has seemed to me more than once when I have been in a
doze, that my dear husband, who died fifteen years since, has come in
and sat down beside me; and that I have even heard him call me by my
name, Alice, as he used to do. Now, can you tell me whether it is
actually true that Mr. Rochester has asked you to marry him? Don’t
laugh at me. But I really thought he came in here five minutes ago, and
said that in a month you would be his wife.”

“He has said the same thing to me,” I replied.

“He has! Do you believe him? Have you accepted him?”

“Yes.”

She looked at me bewildered.

“I could never have thought it. He is a proud man: all the Rochesters
were proud: and his father, at least, liked money. He, too, has always
been called careful. He means to marry you?”

“He tells me so.”

She surveyed my whole person: in her eyes I read that they had there
found no charm powerful enough to solve the enigma.

“It passes me!” she continued; “but no doubt it is true since you say
so. How it will answer, I cannot tell: I really don’t know. Equality of
position and fortune is often advisable in such cases; and there are
twenty years of difference in your ages. He might almost be your
father.”

“No, indeed, Mrs. Fairfax!” exclaimed I, nettled; “he is nothing like
my father! No one, who saw us together, would suppose it for an
instant. Mr. Rochester looks as young, and is as young, as some men at
five-and-twenty.”

“Is it really for love he is going to marry you?” she asked.

I was so hurt by her coldness and scepticism, that the tears rose to my
eyes.

“I am sorry to grieve you,” pursued the widow; “but you are so young,
and so little acquainted with men, I wished to put you on your guard.
It is an old saying that ‘all is not gold that glitters;’ and in this
case I do fear there will be something found to be different to what
either you or I expect.”

“Why?—am I a monster?” I said: “is it impossible that Mr. Rochester
should have a sincere affection for me?”

“No: you are very well; and much improved of late; and Mr. Rochester, I
daresay, is fond of you. I have always noticed that you were a sort of
pet of his. There are times when, for your sake, I have been a little
uneasy at his marked preference, and have wished to put you on your
guard: but I did not like to suggest even the possibility of wrong. I
knew such an idea would shock, perhaps offend you; and you were so
discreet, and so thoroughly modest and sensible, I hoped you might be
trusted to protect yourself. Last night I cannot tell you what I
suffered when I sought all over the house, and could find you nowhere,
nor the master either; and then, at twelve o’clock, saw you come in
with him.”

“Well, never mind that now,” I interrupted impatiently; “it is enough
that all was right.”

“I hope all will be right in the end,” she said: “but believe me, you
cannot be too careful. Try and keep Mr. Rochester at a distance:
distrust yourself as well as him. Gentlemen in his station are not
accustomed to marry their governesses.”

I was growing truly irritated: happily, Adèle ran in.

“Let me go,—let me go to Millcote too!” she cried. “Mr. Rochester
won’t: though there is so much room in the new carriage. Beg him to let
me go, mademoiselle.”

“That I will, Adèle;” and I hastened away with her, glad to quit my
gloomy monitress. The carriage was ready: they were bringing it round
to the front, and my master was pacing the pavement, Pilot following
him backwards and forwards.

“Adèle may accompany us, may she not, sir?”

“I told her no. I’ll have no brats!—I’ll have only you.”

“Do let her go, Mr. Rochester, if you please: it would be better.”

“Not it: she will be a restraint.”

He was quite peremptory, both in look and voice. The chill of Mrs.
Fairfax’s warnings, and the damp of her doubts were upon me: something
of unsubstantiality and uncertainty had beset my hopes. I half lost the
sense of power over him. I was about mechanically to obey him, without
further remonstrance; but as he helped me into the carriage, he looked
at my face.

“What is the matter?” he asked; “all the sunshine is gone. Do you
really wish the bairn to go? Will it annoy you if she is left behind?”

“I would far rather she went, sir.”

“Then off for your bonnet, and back like a flash of lightning!” cried
he to Adèle.

She obeyed him with what speed she might.

“After all, a single morning’s interruption will not matter much,” said
he, “when I mean shortly to claim you—your thoughts, conversation, and
company—for life.”

Adèle, when lifted in, commenced kissing me, by way of expressing her
gratitude for my intercession: she was instantly stowed away into a
corner on the other side of him. She then peeped round to where I sat;
so stern a neighbour was too restrictive: to him, in his present
fractious mood, she dared whisper no observations, nor ask of him any
information.

“Let her come to me,” I entreated: “she will, perhaps, trouble you,
sir: there is plenty of room on this side.”

He handed her over as if she had been a lapdog. “I’ll send her to
school yet,” he said, but now he was smiling.

Adèle heard him, and asked if she was to go to school “sans
mademoiselle?”

“Yes,” he replied, “absolutely sans mademoiselle; for I am to take
mademoiselle to the moon, and there I shall seek a cave in one of the
white valleys among the volcano-tops, and mademoiselle shall live with
me there, and only me.”

“She will have nothing to eat: you will starve her,” observed Adèle.

“I shall gather manna for her morning and night: the plains and
hillsides in the moon are bleached with manna, Adèle.”

“She will want to warm herself: what will she do for a fire?”

“Fire rises out of the lunar mountains: when she is cold, I’ll carry
her up to a peak, and lay her down on the edge of a crater.”

“Oh, qu’elle y sera mal—peu comfortable! And her clothes, they will
wear out: how can she get new ones?”

Mr. Rochester professed to be puzzled. “Hem!” said he. “What would you
do, Adèle? Cudgel your brains for an expedient. How would a white or a
pink cloud answer for a gown, do you think? And one could cut a pretty
enough scarf out of a rainbow.”

“She is far better as she is,” concluded Adèle, after musing some time:
“besides, she would get tired of living with only you in the moon. If I
were mademoiselle, I would never consent to go with you.”

“She has consented: she has pledged her word.”

“But you can’t get her there; there is no road to the moon: it is all
air; and neither you nor she can fly.”

“Adèle, look at that field.” We were now outside Thornfield gates, and
bowling lightly along the smooth road to Millcote, where the dust was
well laid by the thunderstorm, and, where the low hedges and lofty
timber trees on each side glistened green and rain-refreshed.

“In that field, Adèle, I was walking late one evening about a fortnight
since—the evening of the day you helped me to make hay in the orchard
meadows; and, as I was tired with raking swaths, I sat down to rest me
on a stile; and there I took out a little book and a pencil, and began
to write about a misfortune that befell me long ago, and a wish I had
for happy days to come: I was writing away very fast, though daylight
was fading from the leaf, when something came up the path and stopped
two yards off me. I looked at it. It was a little thing with a veil of
gossamer on its head. I beckoned it to come near me; it stood soon at
my knee. I never spoke to it, and it never spoke to me, in words; but I
read its eyes, and it read mine; and our speechless colloquy was to
this effect—

“It was a fairy, and come from Elf-land, it said; and its errand was to
make me happy: I must go with it out of the common world to a lonely
place—such as the moon, for instance—and it nodded its head towards her
horn, rising over Hay-hill: it told me of the alabaster cave and silver
vale where we might live. I said I should like to go; but reminded it,
as you did me, that I had no wings to fly.

“‘Oh,’ returned the fairy, ‘that does not signify! Here is a talisman
will remove all difficulties;’ and she held out a pretty gold ring.
‘Put it,’ she said, ‘on the fourth finger of my left hand, and I am
yours, and you are mine; and we shall leave earth, and make our own
heaven yonder.’ She nodded again at the moon. The ring, Adèle, is in my
breeches-pocket, under the disguise of a sovereign: but I mean soon to
change it to a ring again.”

“But what has mademoiselle to do with it? I don’t care for the fairy:
you said it was mademoiselle you would take to the moon?”

“Mademoiselle is a fairy,” he said, whispering mysteriously. Whereupon
I told her not to mind his badinage; and she, on her part, evinced a
fund of genuine French scepticism: denominating Mr. Rochester “un vrai
menteur,” and assuring him that she made no account whatever of his
“contes de fée,” and that “du reste, il n’y avait pas de fées, et quand
même il y en avait:” she was sure they would never appear to him, nor
ever give him rings, or offer to live with him in the moon.

The hour spent at Millcote was a somewhat harassing one to me. Mr.
Rochester obliged me to go to a certain silk warehouse: there I was
ordered to choose half-a-dozen dresses. I hated the business, I begged
leave to defer it: no—it should be gone through with now. By dint of
entreaties expressed in energetic whispers, I reduced the half-dozen to
two: these however, he vowed he would select himself. With anxiety I
watched his eye rove over the gay stores: he fixed on a rich silk of
the most brilliant amethyst dye, and a superb pink satin. I told him in
a new series of whispers, that he might as well buy me a gold gown and
a silver bonnet at once: I should certainly never venture to wear his
choice. With infinite difficulty, for he was stubborn as a stone, I
persuaded him to make an exchange in favour of a sober black satin and
pearl-grey silk. “It might pass for the present,” he said; “but he
would yet see me glittering like a parterre.”

Glad was I to get him out of the silk warehouse, and then out of a
jeweller’s shop: the more he bought me, the more my cheek burned with a
sense of annoyance and degradation. As we re-entered the carriage, and
I sat back feverish and fagged, I remembered what, in the hurry of
events, dark and bright, I had wholly forgotten—the letter of my uncle,
John Eyre, to Mrs. Reed: his intention to adopt me and make me his
legatee. “It would, indeed, be a relief,” I thought, “if I had ever so
small an independency; I never can bear being dressed like a doll by
Mr. Rochester, or sitting like a second Danae with the golden shower
falling daily round me. I will write to Madeira the moment I get home,
and tell my uncle John I am going to be married, and to whom: if I had
but a prospect of one day bringing Mr. Rochester an accession of
fortune, I could better endure to be kept by him now.” And somewhat
relieved by this idea (which I failed not to execute that day), I
ventured once more to meet my master’s and lover’s eye, which most
pertinaciously sought mine, though I averted both face and gaze. He
smiled; and I thought his smile was such as a sultan might, in a
blissful and fond moment, bestow on a slave his gold and gems had
enriched: I crushed his hand, which was ever hunting mine, vigorously,
and thrust it back to him red with the passionate pressure.

“You need not look in that way,” I said; “if you do, I’ll wear nothing
but my old Lowood frocks to the end of the chapter. I’ll be married in
this lilac gingham: you may make a dressing-gown for yourself out of
the pearl-grey silk, and an infinite series of waistcoats out of the
black satin.”

He chuckled; he rubbed his hands. “Oh, it is rich to see and hear her!”
he exclaimed. “Is she original? Is she piquant? I would not exchange
this one little English girl for the Grand Turk’s whole seraglio,
gazelle-eyes, houri forms, and all!”

The Eastern allusion bit me again. “I’ll not stand you an inch in the
stead of a seraglio,” I said; “so don’t consider me an equivalent for
one. If you have a fancy for anything in that line, away with you, sir,
to the bazaars of Stamboul without delay, and lay out in extensive
slave-purchases some of that spare cash you seem at a loss to spend
satisfactorily here.”

“And what will you do, Janet, while I am bargaining for so many tons of
flesh and such an assortment of black eyes?”

“I’ll be preparing myself to go out as a missionary to preach liberty
to them that are enslaved—your harem inmates amongst the rest. I’ll get
admitted there, and I’ll stir up mutiny; and you, three-tailed bashaw
as you are, sir, shall in a trice find yourself fettered amongst our
hands: nor will I, for one, consent to cut your bonds till you have
signed a charter, the most liberal that despot ever yet conferred.”

“I would consent to be at your mercy, Jane.”

“I would have no mercy, Mr. Rochester, if you supplicated for it with
an eye like that. While you looked so, I should be certain that
whatever charter you might grant under coercion, your first act, when
released, would be to violate its conditions.”

“Why, Jane, what would you have? I fear you will compel me to go
through a private marriage ceremony, besides that performed at the
altar. You will stipulate, I see, for peculiar terms—what will they
be?”

“I only want an easy mind, sir; not crushed by crowded obligations. Do
you remember what you said of Céline Varens?—of the diamonds, the
cashmeres you gave her? I will not be your English Céline Varens. I
shall continue to act as Adèle’s governess; by that I shall earn my
board and lodging, and thirty pounds a year besides. I’ll furnish my
own wardrobe out of that money, and you shall give me nothing but—”

“Well, but what?”

“Your regard; and if I give you mine in return, that debt will be
quit.”

“Well, for cool native impudence and pure innate pride, you haven’t
your equal,” said he. We were now approaching Thornfield. “Will it
please you to dine with me to-day?” he asked, as we re-entered the
gates.

“No, thank you, sir.”

“And what for, ‘no, thank you?’ if one may inquire.”

“I never have dined with you, sir: and I see no reason why I should
now: till—”

“Till what? You delight in half-phrases.”

“Till I can’t help it.”

“Do you suppose I eat like an ogre or a ghoul, that you dread being the
companion of my repast?”

“I have formed no supposition on the subject, sir; but I want to go on
as usual for another month.”

“You will give up your governessing slavery at once.”

“Indeed, begging your pardon, sir, I shall not. I shall just go on with
it as usual. I shall keep out of your way all day, as I have been
accustomed to do: you may send for me in the evening, when you feel
disposed to see me, and I’ll come then; but at no other time.”

“I want a smoke, Jane, or a pinch of snuff, to comfort me under all
this, ‘pour me donner une contenance,’ as Adèle would say; and
unfortunately I have neither my cigar-case, nor my snuff-box. But
listen—whisper. It is your time now, little tyrant, but it will be mine
presently; and when once I have fairly seized you, to have and to hold,
I’ll just—figuratively speaking—attach you to a chain like this”
(touching his watch-guard). “Yes, bonny wee thing, I’ll wear you in my
bosom, lest my jewel I should tyne.”

He said this as he helped me to alight from the carriage, and while he
afterwards lifted out Adèle, I entered the house, and made good my
retreat upstairs.

He duly summoned me to his presence in the evening. I had prepared an
occupation for him; for I was determined not to spend the whole time in
a _tête-à-tête_ conversation. I remembered his fine voice; I knew he
liked to sing—good singers generally do. I was no vocalist myself, and,
in his fastidious judgment, no musician, either; but I delighted in
listening when the performance was good. No sooner had twilight, that
hour of romance, began to lower her blue and starry banner over the
lattice, than I rose, opened the piano, and entreated him, for the love
of heaven, to give me a song. He said I was a capricious witch, and
that he would rather sing another time; but I averred that no time was
like the present.

“Did I like his voice?” he asked.

“Very much.” I was not fond of pampering that susceptible vanity of
his; but for once, and from motives of expediency, I would e’en soothe
and stimulate it.

“Then, Jane, you must play the accompaniment.”

“Very well, sir, I will try.”

I did try, but was presently swept off the stool and denominated “a
little bungler.” Being pushed unceremoniously to one side—which was
precisely what I wished—he usurped my place, and proceeded to accompany
himself: for he could play as well as sing. I hied me to the
window-recess. And while I sat there and looked out on the still trees
and dim lawn, to a sweet air was sung in mellow tones the following
strain:—

“The truest love that ever heart
Felt at its kindled core,
Did through each vein, in quickened start,
The tide of being pour.

Her coming was my hope each day,
Her parting was my pain;
The chance that did her steps delay
Was ice in every vein.

I dreamed it would be nameless bliss,
As I loved, loved to be;
And to this object did I press
As blind as eagerly.

But wide as pathless was the space
That lay our lives between,
And dangerous as the foamy race
Of ocean-surges green.

And haunted as a robber-path
Through wilderness or wood;
For Might and Right, and Woe and Wrath,
Between our spirits stood.

I dangers dared; I hindrance scorned;
I omens did defy:
Whatever menaced, harassed, warned,
I passed impetuous by.

On sped my rainbow, fast as light;
I flew as in a dream;
For glorious rose upon my sight
That child of Shower and Gleam.

Still bright on clouds of suffering dim
Shines that soft, solemn joy;
Nor care I now, how dense and grim
Disasters gather nigh.

I care not in this moment sweet,
Though all I have rushed o’er
Should come on pinion, strong and fleet,
Proclaiming vengeance sore:

Though haughty Hate should strike me down,
Right, bar approach to me,
And grinding Might, with furious frown,
Swear endless enmity.

My love has placed her little hand
With noble faith in mine,
And vowed that wedlock’s sacred band
Our nature shall entwine.

My love has sworn, with sealing kiss,
With me to live—to die;
I have at last my nameless bliss.
As I love—loved am I!”


He rose and came towards me, and I saw his face all kindled, and his
full falcon-eye flashing, and tenderness and passion in every
lineament. I quailed momentarily—then I rallied. Soft scene, daring
demonstration, I would not have; and I stood in peril of both: a weapon
of defence must be prepared—I whetted my tongue: as he reached me, I
asked with asperity, “whom he was going to marry now?”

“That was a strange question to be put by his darling Jane.”

“Indeed! I considered it a very natural and necessary one: he had
talked of his future wife dying with him. What did he mean by such a
pagan idea? _I_ had no intention of dying with him—he might depend on
that.”

“Oh, all he longed, all he prayed for, was that I might live with him!
Death was not for such as I.”

“Indeed it was: I had as good a right to die when my time came as he
had: but I should bide that time, and not be hurried away in a suttee.”

“Would I forgive him for the selfish idea, and prove my pardon by a
reconciling kiss?”

“No: I would rather be excused.”

Here I heard myself apostrophised as a “hard little thing;” and it was
added, “any other woman would have been melted to marrow at hearing
such stanzas crooned in her praise.”

I assured him I was naturally hard—very flinty, and that he would often
find me so; and that, moreover, I was determined to show him divers
rugged points in my character before the ensuing four weeks elapsed: he
should know fully what sort of a bargain he had made, while there was
yet time to rescind it.

“Would I be quiet and talk rationally?”

“I would be quiet if he liked, and as to talking rationally, I
flattered myself I was doing that now.”

He fretted, pished, and pshawed. “Very good,” I thought; “you may fume
and fidget as you please: but this is the best plan to pursue with you,
I am certain. I like you more than I can say; but I’ll not sink into a
bathos of sentiment: and with this needle of repartee I’ll keep you
from the edge of the gulf too; and, moreover, maintain by its pungent
aid that distance between you and myself most conducive to our real
mutual advantage.”

From less to more, I worked him up to considerable irritation; then,
after he had retired, in dudgeon, quite to the other end of the room, I
got up, and saying, “I wish you good-night, sir,” in my natural and
wonted respectful manner, I slipped out by the side-door and got away.

The system thus entered on, I pursued during the whole season of
probation; and with the best success. He was kept, to be sure, rather
cross and crusty; but on the whole I could see he was excellently
entertained, and that a lamb-like submission and turtle-dove
sensibility, while fostering his despotism more, would have pleased his
judgment, satisfied his common-sense, and even suited his taste less.

In other people’s presence I was, as formerly, deferential and quiet;
any other line of conduct being uncalled for: it was only in the
evening conferences I thus thwarted and afflicted him. He continued to
send for me punctually the moment the clock struck seven; though when I
appeared before him now, he had no such honeyed terms as “love” and
“darling” on his lips: the best words at my service were “provoking
puppet,” “malicious elf,” “sprite,” “changeling,” &c. For caresses,
too, I now got grimaces; for a pressure of the hand, a pinch on the
arm; for a kiss on the cheek, a severe tweak of the ear. It was all
right: at present I decidedly preferred these fierce favours to
anything more tender. Mrs. Fairfax, I saw, approved me: her anxiety on
my account vanished; therefore I was certain I did well. Meantime, Mr.
Rochester affirmed I was wearing him to skin and bone, and threatened
awful vengeance for my present conduct at some period fast coming. I
laughed in my sleeve at his menaces. “I can keep you in reasonable
check now,” I reflected; “and I don’t doubt to be able to do it
hereafter: if one expedient loses its virtue, another must be devised.”

Yet after all my task was not an easy one; often I would rather have
pleased than teased him. My future husband was becoming to me my whole
world; and more than the world: almost my hope of heaven. He stood
between me and every thought of religion, as an eclipse intervenes
between man and the broad sun. I could not, in those days, see God for
His creature: of whom I had made an idol.




CHAPTER XXV


The month of courtship had wasted: its very last hours were being
numbered. There was no putting off the day that advanced—the bridal
day; and all preparations for its arrival were complete. _I_, at least,
had nothing more to do: there were my trunks, packed, locked, corded,
ranged in a row along the wall of my little chamber; to-morrow, at this
time, they would be far on their road to London: and so should I
(D.V.),—or rather, not I, but one Jane Rochester, a person whom as yet
I knew not. The cards of address alone remained to nail on: they lay,
four little squares, in the drawer. Mr. Rochester had himself written
the direction, “Mrs. Rochester, —— Hotel, London,” on each: I could not
persuade myself to affix them, or to have them affixed. Mrs. Rochester!
She did not exist: she would not be born till to-morrow, some time
after eight o’clock A.M.; and I would wait to be assured she had come
into the world alive before I assigned to her all that property. It was
enough that in yonder closet, opposite my dressing-table, garments said
to be hers had already displaced my black stuff Lowood frock and straw
bonnet: for not to me appertained that suit of wedding raiment; the
pearl-coloured robe, the vapoury veil pendent from the usurped
portmanteau. I shut the closet to conceal the strange, wraith-like
apparel it contained; which, at this evening hour—nine o’clock—gave out
certainly a most ghostly shimmer through the shadow of my apartment. “I
will leave you by yourself, white dream,” I said. “I am feverish: I
hear the wind blowing: I will go out of doors and feel it.”

It was not only the hurry of preparation that made me feverish; not
only the anticipation of the great change—the new life which was to
commence to-morrow: both these circumstances had their share,
doubtless, in producing that restless, excited mood which hurried me
forth at this late hour into the darkening grounds: but a third cause
influenced my mind more than they.

I had at heart a strange and anxious thought. Something had happened
which I could not comprehend; no one knew of or had seen the event but
myself: it had taken place the preceding night. Mr. Rochester that
night was absent from home; nor was he yet returned: business had
called him to a small estate of two or three farms he possessed thirty
miles off—business it was requisite he should settle in person,
previous to his meditated departure from England. I waited now his
return; eager to disburthen my mind, and to seek of him the solution of
the enigma that perplexed me. Stay till he comes, reader; and, when I
disclose my secret to him, you shall share the confidence.

I sought the orchard, driven to its shelter by the wind, which all day
had blown strong and full from the south, without, however, bringing a
speck of rain. Instead of subsiding as night drew on, it seemed to
augment its rush and deepen its roar: the trees blew steadfastly one
way, never writhing round, and scarcely tossing back their boughs once
in an hour; so continuous was the strain bending their branchy heads
northward—the clouds drifted from pole to pole, fast following, mass on
mass: no glimpse of blue sky had been visible that July day.

It was not without a certain wild pleasure I ran before the wind,
delivering my trouble of mind to the measureless air-torrent thundering
through space. Descending the laurel walk, I faced the wreck of the
chestnut-tree; it stood up black and riven: the trunk, split down the
centre, gasped ghastly. The cloven halves were not broken from each
other, for the firm base and strong roots kept them unsundered below;
though community of vitality was destroyed—the sap could flow no more:
their great boughs on each side were dead, and next winter’s tempests
would be sure to fell one or both to earth: as yet, however, they might
be said to form one tree—a ruin, but an entire ruin.

“You did right to hold fast to each other,” I said: as if the
monster-splinters were living things, and could hear me. “I think,
scathed as you look, and charred and scorched, there must be a little
sense of life in you yet, rising out of that adhesion at the faithful,
honest roots: you will never have green leaves more—never more see
birds making nests and singing idyls in your boughs; the time of
pleasure and love is over with you: but you are not desolate: each of
you has a comrade to sympathise with him in his decay.” As I looked up
at them, the moon appeared momentarily in that part of the sky which
filled their fissure; her disk was blood-red and half overcast; she
seemed to throw on me one bewildered, dreary glance, and buried herself
again instantly in the deep drift of cloud. The wind fell, for a
second, round Thornfield; but far away over wood and water, poured a
wild, melancholy wail: it was sad to listen to, and I ran off again.

Here and there I strayed through the orchard, gathered up the apples
with which the grass round the tree roots was thickly strewn; then I
employed myself in dividing the ripe from the unripe; I carried them
into the house and put them away in the store-room. Then I repaired to
the library to ascertain whether the fire was lit, for, though summer,
I knew on such a gloomy evening Mr. Rochester would like to see a
cheerful hearth when he came in: yes, the fire had been kindled some
time, and burnt well. I placed his arm-chair by the chimney-corner: I
wheeled the table near it: I let down the curtain, and had the candles
brought in ready for lighting. More restless than ever, when I had
completed these arrangements I could not sit still, nor even remain in
the house: a little time-piece in the room and the old clock in the
hall simultaneously struck ten.

“How late it grows!” I said. “I will run down to the gates: it is
moonlight at intervals; I can see a good way on the road. He may be
coming now, and to meet him will save some minutes of suspense.”

The wind roared high in the great trees which embowered the gates; but
the road as far as I could see, to the right hand and the left, was all
still and solitary: save for the shadows of clouds crossing it at
intervals as the moon looked out, it was but a long pale line, unvaried
by one moving speck.

A puerile tear dimmed my eye while I looked—a tear of disappointment
and impatience; ashamed of it, I wiped it away. I lingered; the moon
shut herself wholly within her chamber, and drew close her curtain of
dense cloud: the night grew dark; rain came driving fast on the gale.

“I wish he would come! I wish he would come!” I exclaimed, seized with
hypochondriac foreboding. I had expected his arrival before tea; now it
was dark: what could keep him? Had an accident happened? The event of
last night again recurred to me. I interpreted it as a warning of
disaster. I feared my hopes were too bright to be realised; and I had
enjoyed so much bliss lately that I imagined my fortune had passed its
meridian, and must now decline.

“Well, I cannot return to the house,” I thought; “I cannot sit by the
fireside, while he is abroad in inclement weather: better tire my limbs
than strain my heart; I will go forward and meet him.”

I set out; I walked fast, but not far: ere I had measured a quarter of
a mile, I heard the tramp of hoofs; a horseman came on, full gallop; a
dog ran by his side. Away with evil presentiment! It was he: here he
was, mounted on Mesrour, followed by Pilot. He saw me; for the moon had
opened a blue field in the sky, and rode in it watery bright: he took
his hat off, and waved it round his head. I now ran to meet him.

“There!” he exclaimed, as he stretched out his hand and bent from the
saddle: “You can’t do without me, that is evident. Step on my boot-toe;
give me both hands: mount!”

I obeyed: joy made me agile: I sprang up before him. A hearty kissing I
got for a welcome, and some boastful triumph, which I swallowed as well
as I could. He checked himself in his exultation to demand, “But is
there anything the matter, Janet, that you come to meet me at such an
hour? Is there anything wrong?”

“No, but I thought you would never come. I could not bear to wait in
the house for you, especially with this rain and wind.”

“Rain and wind, indeed! Yes, you are dripping like a mermaid; pull my
cloak round you: but I think you are feverish, Jane: both your cheek
and hand are burning hot. I ask again, is there anything the matter?”

“Nothing now; I am neither afraid nor unhappy.”

“Then you have been both?”

“Rather: but I’ll tell you all about it by-and-bye, sir; and I daresay
you will only laugh at me for my pains.”

“I’ll laugh at you heartily when to-morrow is past; till then I dare
not: my prize is not certain. This is you, who have been as slippery as
an eel this last month, and as thorny as a briar-rose? I could not lay
a finger anywhere but I was pricked; and now I seem to have gathered up
a stray lamb in my arms. You wandered out of the fold to seek your
shepherd, did you, Jane?”

“I wanted you: but don’t boast. Here we are at Thornfield: now let me
get down.”

He landed me on the pavement. As John took his horse, and he followed
me into the hall, he told me to make haste and put something dry on,
and then return to him in the library; and he stopped me, as I made for
the staircase, to extort a promise that I would not be long: nor was I
long; in five minutes I rejoined him. I found him at supper.

“Take a seat and bear me company, Jane: please God, it is the last meal
but one you will eat at Thornfield Hall for a long time.”

I sat down near him, but told him I could not eat.

“Is it because you have the prospect of a journey before you, Jane? Is
it the thoughts of going to London that takes away your appetite?”

“I cannot see my prospects clearly to-night, sir; and I hardly know
what thoughts I have in my head. Everything in life seems unreal.”

“Except me: I am substantial enough—touch me.”

“You, sir, are the most phantom-like of all: you are a mere dream.”

He held out his hand, laughing. “Is that a dream?” said he, placing it
close to my eyes. He had a rounded, muscular, and vigorous hand, as
well as a long, strong arm.

“Yes; though I touch it, it is a dream,” said I, as I put it down from
before my face. “Sir, have you finished supper?”

“Yes, Jane.”

I rang the bell and ordered away the tray. When we were again alone, I
stirred the fire, and then took a low seat at my master’s knee.

“It is near midnight,” I said.

“Yes: but remember, Jane, you promised to wake with me the night before
my wedding.”

“I did; and I will keep my promise, for an hour or two at least: I have
no wish to go to bed.”

“Are all your arrangements complete?”

“All, sir.”

“And on my part likewise,” he returned, “I have settled everything; and
we shall leave Thornfield to-morrow, within half-an-hour after our
return from church.”

“Very well, sir.”

“With what an extraordinary smile you uttered that word—‘very well,’
Jane! What a bright spot of colour you have on each cheek! and how
strangely your eyes glitter! Are you well?”

“I believe I am.”

“Believe! What is the matter? Tell me what you feel.”

“I could not, sir: no words could tell you what I feel. I wish this
present hour would never end: who knows with what fate the next may
come charged?”

“This is hypochondria, Jane. You have been over-excited, or
over-fatigued.”

“Do you, sir, feel calm and happy?”

“Calm?—no: but happy—to the heart’s core.”

I looked up at him to read the signs of bliss in his face: it was
ardent and flushed.

“Give me your confidence, Jane,” he said: “relieve your mind of any
weight that oppresses it, by imparting it to me. What do you fear?—that
I shall not prove a good husband?”

“It is the idea farthest from my thoughts.”

“Are you apprehensive of the new sphere you are about to enter?—of the
new life into which you are passing?”

“No.”

“You puzzle me, Jane: your look and tone of sorrowful audacity perplex
and pain me. I want an explanation.”

“Then, sir, listen. You were from home last night?”

“I was: I know that; and you hinted a while ago at something which had
happened in my absence:—nothing, probably, of consequence; but, in
short, it has disturbed you. Let me hear it. Mrs. Fairfax has said
something, perhaps? or you have overheard the servants talk?—your
sensitive self-respect has been wounded?”

“No, sir.” It struck twelve—I waited till the time-piece had concluded
its silver chime, and the clock its hoarse, vibrating stroke, and then
I proceeded.

“All day yesterday I was very busy, and very happy in my ceaseless
bustle; for I am not, as you seem to think, troubled by any haunting
fears about the new sphere, et cetera: I think it a glorious thing to
have the hope of living with you, because I love you. No, sir, don’t
caress me now—let me talk undisturbed. Yesterday I trusted well in
Providence, and believed that events were working together for your
good and mine: it was a fine day, if you recollect—the calmness of the
air and sky forbade apprehensions respecting your safety or comfort on
your journey. I walked a little while on the pavement after tea,
thinking of you; and I beheld you in imagination so near me, I scarcely
missed your actual presence. I thought of the life that lay before
me—_your_ life, sir—an existence more expansive and stirring than my
own: as much more so as the depths of the sea to which the brook runs
are than the shallows of its own strait channel. I wondered why
moralists call this world a dreary wilderness: for me it blossomed like
a rose. Just at sunset, the air turned cold and the sky cloudy: I went
in, Sophie called me upstairs to look at my wedding-dress, which they
had just brought; and under it in the box I found your present—the veil
which, in your princely extravagance, you sent for from London:
resolved, I suppose, since I would not have jewels, to cheat me into
accepting something as costly. I smiled as I unfolded it, and devised
how I would tease you about your aristocratic tastes, and your efforts
to masque your plebeian bride in the attributes of a peeress. I thought
how I would carry down to you the square of unembroidered blond I had
myself prepared as a covering for my low-born head, and ask if that was
not good enough for a woman who could bring her husband neither
fortune, beauty, nor connections. I saw plainly how you would look; and
heard your impetuous republican answers, and your haughty disavowal of
any necessity on your part to augment your wealth, or elevate your
standing, by marrying either a purse or a coronet.”

“How well you read me, you witch!” interposed Mr. Rochester: “but what
did you find in the veil besides its embroidery? Did you find poison,
or a dagger, that you look so mournful now?”

“No, no, sir; besides the delicacy and richness of the fabric, I found
nothing save Fairfax Rochester’s pride; and that did not scare me,
because I am used to the sight of the demon. But, sir, as it grew dark,
the wind rose: it blew yesterday evening, not as it blows now—wild and
high—but ‘with a sullen, moaning sound’ far more eerie. I wished you
were at home. I came into this room, and the sight of the empty chair
and fireless hearth chilled me. For some time after I went to bed, I
could not sleep—a sense of anxious excitement distressed me. The gale
still rising, seemed to my ear to muffle a mournful under-sound;
whether in the house or abroad I could not at first tell, but it
recurred, doubtful yet doleful at every lull; at last I made out it
must be some dog howling at a distance. I was glad when it ceased. On
sleeping, I continued in dreams the idea of a dark and gusty night. I
continued also the wish to be with you, and experienced a strange,
regretful consciousness of some barrier dividing us. During all my
first sleep, I was following the windings of an unknown road; total
obscurity environed me; rain pelted me; I was burdened with the charge
of a little child: a very small creature, too young and feeble to walk,
and which shivered in my cold arms, and wailed piteously in my ear. I
thought, sir, that you were on the road a long way before me; and I
strained every nerve to overtake you, and made effort on effort to
utter your name and entreat you to stop—but my movements were fettered,
and my voice still died away inarticulate; while you, I felt, withdrew
farther and farther every moment.”

“And these dreams weigh on your spirits now, Jane, when I am close to
you? Little nervous subject! Forget visionary woe, and think only of
real happiness! You say you love me, Janet: yes—I will not forget that;
and you cannot deny it. _Those_ words did not die inarticulate on your
lips. I heard them clear and soft: a thought too solemn perhaps, but
sweet as music—‘I think it is a glorious thing to have the hope of
living with you, Edward, because I love you.’ Do you love me,
Jane?—repeat it.”

“I do, sir—I do, with my whole heart.”

“Well,” he said, after some minutes’ silence, “it is strange; but that
sentence has penetrated my breast painfully. Why? I think because you
said it with such an earnest, religious energy, and because your upward
gaze at me now is the very sublime of faith, truth, and devotion: it is
too much as if some spirit were near me. Look wicked, Jane: as you know
well how to look: coin one of your wild, shy, provoking smiles; tell me
you hate me—tease me, vex me; do anything but move me: I would rather
be incensed than saddened.”

“I will tease you and vex you to your heart’s content, when I have
finished my tale: but hear me to the end.”

“I thought, Jane, you had told me all. I thought I had found the source
of your melancholy in a dream.”

I shook my head. “What! is there more? But I will not believe it to be
anything important. I warn you of incredulity beforehand. Go on.”

The disquietude of his air, the somewhat apprehensive impatience of his
manner, surprised me: but I proceeded.

“I dreamt another dream, sir: that Thornfield Hall was a dreary ruin,
the retreat of bats and owls. I thought that of all the stately front
nothing remained but a shell-like wall, very high and very
fragile-looking. I wandered, on a moonlight night, through the
grass-grown enclosure within: here I stumbled over a marble hearth, and
there over a fallen fragment of cornice. Wrapped up in a shawl, I still
carried the unknown little child: I might not lay it down anywhere,
however tired were my arms—however much its weight impeded my progress,
I must retain it. I heard the gallop of a horse at a distance on the
road; I was sure it was you; and you were departing for many years and
for a distant country. I climbed the thin wall with frantic perilous
haste, eager to catch one glimpse of you from the top: the stones
rolled from under my feet, the ivy branches I grasped gave way, the
child clung round my neck in terror, and almost strangled me; at last I
gained the summit. I saw you like a speck on a white track, lessening
every moment. The blast blew so strong I could not stand. I sat down on
the narrow ledge; I hushed the scared infant in my lap: you turned an
angle of the road: I bent forward to take a last look; the wall
crumbled; I was shaken; the child rolled from my knee, I lost my
balance, fell, and woke.”

“Now, Jane, that is all.”

“All the preface, sir; the tale is yet to come. On waking, a gleam
dazzled my eyes; I thought—Oh, it is daylight! But I was mistaken; it
was only candlelight. Sophie, I supposed, had come in. There was a
light in the dressing-table, and the door of the closet, where, before
going to bed, I had hung my wedding-dress and veil, stood open; I heard
a rustling there. I asked, ‘Sophie, what are you doing?’ No one
answered; but a form emerged from the closet; it took the light, held
it aloft, and surveyed the garments pendent from the portmanteau.
‘Sophie! Sophie!’ I again cried: and still it was silent. I had risen
up in bed, I bent forward: first surprise, then bewilderment, came over
me; and then my blood crept cold through my veins. Mr. Rochester, this
was not Sophie, it was not Leah, it was not Mrs. Fairfax: it was
not—no, I was sure of it, and am still—it was not even that strange
woman, Grace Poole.”

“It must have been one of them,” interrupted my master.

“No, sir, I solemnly assure you to the contrary. The shape standing
before me had never crossed my eyes within the precincts of Thornfield
Hall before; the height, the contour were new to me.”

“Describe it, Jane.”

“It seemed, sir, a woman, tall and large, with thick and dark hair
hanging long down her back. I know not what dress she had on: it was
white and straight; but whether gown, sheet, or shroud, I cannot tell.”

“Did you see her face?”

“Not at first. But presently she took my veil from its place; she held
it up, gazed at it long, and then she threw it over her own head, and
turned to the mirror. At that moment I saw the reflection of the visage
and features quite distinctly in the dark oblong glass.”

“And how were they?”

“Fearful and ghastly to me—oh, sir, I never saw a face like it! It was
a discoloured face—it was a savage face. I wish I could forget the roll
of the red eyes and the fearful blackened inflation of the lineaments!”

“Ghosts are usually pale, Jane.”

“This, sir, was purple: the lips were swelled and dark; the brow
furrowed: the black eyebrows widely raised over the bloodshot eyes.
Shall I tell you of what it reminded me?”

“You may.”

“Of the foul German spectre—the Vampyre.”

“Ah!—what did it do?”

“Sir, it removed my veil from its gaunt head, rent it in two parts, and
flinging both on the floor, trampled on them.”


It removed my veil from its gaunt head, rent it in two parts, and
flinging both on the floor, trampled on them

“Afterwards?”

“It drew aside the window-curtain and looked out; perhaps it saw dawn
approaching, for, taking the candle, it retreated to the door. Just at
my bedside, the figure stopped: the fiery eyes glared upon me—she
thrust up her candle close to my face, and extinguished it under my
eyes. I was aware her lurid visage flamed over mine, and I lost
consciousness: for the second time in my life—only the second time—I
became insensible from terror.”

“Who was with you when you revived?”

“No one, sir, but the broad day. I rose, bathed my head and face in
water, drank a long draught; felt that though enfeebled I was not ill,
and determined that to none but you would I impart this vision. Now,
sir, tell me who and what that woman was?”

“The creature of an over-stimulated brain; that is certain. I must be
careful of you, my treasure: nerves like yours were not made for rough
handling.”

“Sir, depend on it, my nerves were not in fault; the thing was real:
the transaction actually took place.”

“And your previous dreams, were they real too? Is Thornfield Hall a
ruin? Am I severed from you by insuperable obstacles? Am I leaving you
without a tear—without a kiss—without a word?”

“Not yet.”

“Am I about to do it? Why, the day is already commenced which is to
bind us indissolubly; and when we are once united, there shall be no
recurrence of these mental terrors: I guarantee that.”

“Mental terrors, sir! I wish I could believe them to be only such: I
wish it more now than ever; since even you cannot explain to me the
mystery of that awful visitant.”

“And since I cannot do it, Jane, it must have been unreal.”

“But, sir, when I said so to myself on rising this morning, and when I
looked round the room to gather courage and comfort from the cheerful
aspect of each familiar object in full daylight, there—on the carpet—I
saw what gave the distinct lie to my hypothesis,—the veil, torn from
top to bottom in two halves!”

I felt Mr. Rochester start and shudder; he hastily flung his arms round
me. “Thank God!” he exclaimed, “that if anything malignant did come
near you last night, it was only the veil that was harmed. Oh, to think
what might have happened!”

He drew his breath short, and strained me so close to him, I could
scarcely pant. After some minutes’ silence, he continued, cheerily—

“Now, Janet, I’ll explain to you all about it. It was half dream, half
reality. A woman did, I doubt not, enter your room: and that woman
was—must have been—Grace Poole. You call her a strange being yourself:
from all you know, you have reason so to call her—what did she do to
me? what to Mason? In a state between sleeping and waking, you noticed
her entrance and her actions; but feverish, almost delirious as you
were, you ascribed to her a goblin appearance different from her own:
the long dishevelled hair, the swelled black face, the exaggerated
stature, were figments of imagination; results of nightmare: the
spiteful tearing of the veil was real: and it is like her. I see you
would ask why I keep such a woman in my house: when we have been
married a year and a day, I will tell you; but not now. Are you
satisfied, Jane? Do you accept my solution of the mystery?”

I reflected, and in truth it appeared to me the only possible one:
satisfied I was not, but to please him I endeavoured to appear
so—relieved, I certainly did feel; so I answered him with a contented
smile. And now, as it was long past one, I prepared to leave him.

“Does not Sophie sleep with Adèle in the nursery?” he asked, as I lit
my candle.

“Yes, sir.”

“And there is room enough in Adèle’s little bed for you. You must share
it with her to-night, Jane: it is no wonder that the incident you have
related should make you nervous, and I would rather you did not sleep
alone: promise me to go to the nursery.”

“I shall be very glad to do so, sir.”

“And fasten the door securely on the inside. Wake Sophie when you go
upstairs, under pretence of requesting her to rouse you in good time
to-morrow; for you must be dressed and have finished breakfast before
eight. And now, no more sombre thoughts: chase dull care away, Janet.
Don’t you hear to what soft whispers the wind has fallen? and there is
no more beating of rain against the window-panes: look here” (he lifted
up the curtain)—“it is a lovely night!”

It was. Half heaven was pure and stainless: the clouds, now trooping
before the wind, which had shifted to the west, were filing off
eastward in long, silvered columns. The moon shone peacefully.

“Well,” said Mr. Rochester, gazing inquiringly into my eyes, “how is my
Janet now?”

“The night is serene, sir; and so am I.”

“And you will not dream of separation and sorrow to-night; but of happy
love and blissful union.”

This prediction was but half fulfilled: I did not indeed dream of
sorrow, but as little did I dream of joy; for I never slept at all.
With little Adèle in my arms, I watched the slumber of childhood—so
tranquil, so passionless, so innocent—and waited for the coming day:
all my life was awake and astir in my frame: and as soon as the sun
rose I rose too. I remember Adèle clung to me as I left her: I remember
I kissed her as I loosened her little hands from my neck; and I cried
over her with strange emotion, and quitted her because I feared my sobs
would break her still sound repose. She seemed the emblem of my past
life; and he, I was now to array myself to meet, the dread, but adored,
type of my unknown future day.




CHAPTER XXVI


Sophie came at seven to dress me: she was very long indeed in
accomplishing her task; so long that Mr. Rochester, grown, I suppose,
impatient of my delay, sent up to ask why I did not come. She was just
fastening my veil (the plain square of blond after all) to my hair with
a brooch; I hurried from under her hands as soon as I could.

“Stop!” she cried in French. “Look at yourself in the mirror: you have
not taken one peep.”

So I turned at the door: I saw a robed and veiled figure, so unlike my
usual self that it seemed almost the image of a stranger. “Jane!”
called a voice, and I hastened down. I was received at the foot of the
stairs by Mr. Rochester.

“Lingerer!” he said, “my brain is on fire with impatience, and you
tarry so long!”

He took me into the dining-room, surveyed me keenly all over,
pronounced me “fair as a lily, and not only the pride of his life, but
the desire of his eyes,” and then telling me he would give me but ten
minutes to eat some breakfast, he rang the bell. One of his lately
hired servants, a footman, answered it.

“Is John getting the carriage ready?”

“Yes, sir.”

“Is the luggage brought down?”

“They are bringing it down, sir.”

“Go you to the church: see if Mr. Wood (the clergyman) and the clerk
are there: return and tell me.”

The church, as the reader knows, was but just beyond the gates; the
footman soon returned.

“Mr. Wood is in the vestry, sir, putting on his surplice.”

“And the carriage?”

“The horses are harnessing.”

“We shall not want it to go to church; but it must be ready the moment
we return: all the boxes and luggage arranged and strapped on, and the
coachman in his seat.”

“Yes, sir.”

“Jane, are you ready?”

I rose. There were no groomsmen, no bridesmaids, no relatives to wait
for or marshal: none but Mr. Rochester and I. Mrs. Fairfax stood in the
hall as we passed. I would fain have spoken to her, but my hand was
held by a grasp of iron: I was hurried along by a stride I could hardly
follow; and to look at Mr. Rochester’s face was to feel that not a
second of delay would be tolerated for any purpose. I wonder what other
bridegroom ever looked as he did—so bent up to a purpose, so grimly
resolute: or who, under such steadfast brows, ever revealed such
flaming and flashing eyes.

I know not whether the day was fair or foul; in descending the drive, I
gazed neither on sky nor earth: my heart was with my eyes; and both
seemed migrated into Mr. Rochester’s frame. I wanted to see the
invisible thing on which, as we went along, he appeared to fasten a
glance fierce and fell. I wanted to feel the thoughts whose force he
seemed breasting and resisting.

At the churchyard wicket he stopped: he discovered I was quite out of
breath. “Am I cruel in my love?” he said. “Delay an instant: lean on
me, Jane.”

And now I can recall the picture of the grey old house of God rising
calm before me, of a rook wheeling round the steeple, of a ruddy
morning sky beyond. I remember something, too, of the green
grave-mounds; and I have not forgotten, either, two figures of
strangers straying amongst the low hillocks and reading the mementoes
graven on the few mossy head-stones. I noticed them, because, as they
saw us, they passed round to the back of the church; and I doubted not
they were going to enter by the side-aisle door and witness the
ceremony. By Mr. Rochester they were not observed; he was earnestly
looking at my face, from which the blood had, I daresay, momentarily
fled: for I felt my forehead dewy, and my cheeks and lips cold. When I
rallied, which I soon did, he walked gently with me up the path to the
porch.

We entered the quiet and humble temple; the priest waited in his white
surplice at the lowly altar, the clerk beside him. All was still: two
shadows only moved in a remote corner. My conjecture had been correct:
the strangers had slipped in before us, and they now stood by the vault
of the Rochesters, their backs towards us, viewing through the rails
the old time-stained marble tomb, where a kneeling angel guarded the
remains of Damer de Rochester, slain at Marston Moor in the time of the
civil wars, and of Elizabeth, his wife.

Our place was taken at the communion rails. Hearing a cautious step
behind me, I glanced over my shoulder: one of the strangers—a
gentleman, evidently—was advancing up the chancel. The service began.
The explanation of the intent of matrimony was gone through; and then
the clergyman came a step further forward, and, bending slightly
towards Mr. Rochester, went on.

“I require and charge you both (as ye will answer at the dreadful day
of judgment, when the secrets of all hearts shall be disclosed), that
if either of you know any impediment why ye may not lawfully be joined
together in matrimony, ye do now confess it; for be ye well assured
that so many as are coupled together otherwise than God’s Word doth
allow, are not joined together by God, neither is their matrimony
lawful.”

He paused, as the custom is. When is the pause after that sentence ever
broken by reply? Not, perhaps, once in a hundred years. And the
clergyman, who had not lifted his eyes from his book, and had held his
breath but for a moment, was proceeding: his hand was already stretched
towards Mr. Rochester, as his lips unclosed to ask, “Wilt thou have
this woman for thy wedded wife?”—when a distinct and near voice said—

“The marriage cannot go on: I declare the existence of an impediment.”

The clergyman looked up at the speaker and stood mute; the clerk did
the same; Mr. Rochester moved slightly, as if an earthquake had rolled
under his feet: taking a firmer footing, and not turning his head or
eyes, he said, “Proceed.”

Profound silence fell when he had uttered that word, with deep but low
intonation. Presently Mr. Wood said—

“I cannot proceed without some investigation into what has been
asserted, and evidence of its truth or falsehood.”

“The ceremony is quite broken off,” subjoined the voice behind us. “I
am in a condition to prove my allegation: an insuperable impediment to
this marriage exists.”

Mr. Rochester heard, but heeded not: he stood stubborn and rigid,
making no movement but to possess himself of my hand. What a hot and
strong grasp he had! and how like quarried marble was his pale, firm,
massive front at this moment! How his eye shone, still watchful, and
yet wild beneath!

Mr. Wood seemed at a loss. “What is the nature of the impediment?” he
asked. “Perhaps it may be got over—explained away?”

“Hardly,” was the answer. “I have called it insuperable, and I speak
advisedly.”

The speaker came forward and leaned on the rails. He continued,
uttering each word distinctly, calmly, steadily, but not loudly—

“It simply consists in the existence of a previous marriage. Mr.
Rochester has a wife now living.”

My nerves vibrated to those low-spoken words as they had never vibrated
to thunder—my blood felt their subtle violence as it had never felt
frost or fire; but I was collected, and in no danger of swooning. I
looked at Mr. Rochester: I made him look at me. His whole face was
colourless rock: his eye was both spark and flint. He disavowed
nothing: he seemed as if he would defy all things. Without speaking,
without smiling, without seeming to recognise in me a human being, he
only twined my waist with his arm and riveted me to his side.

“Who are you?” he asked of the intruder.

“My name is Briggs, a solicitor of —— Street, London.”

“And you would thrust on me a wife?”

“I would remind you of your lady’s existence, sir, which the law
recognises, if you do not.”

“Favour me with an account of her—with her name, her parentage, her
place of abode.”

“Certainly.” Mr. Briggs calmly took a paper from his pocket, and read
out in a sort of official, nasal voice:—

“‘I affirm and can prove that on the 20th of October A.D. —— (a date of
fifteen years back), Edward Fairfax Rochester, of Thornfield Hall, in
the county of ——, and of Ferndean Manor, in ——shire, England, was
married to my sister, Bertha Antoinetta Mason, daughter of Jonas Mason,
merchant, and of Antoinetta his wife, a Creole, at —— church, Spanish
Town, Jamaica. The record of the marriage will be found in the register
of that church—a copy of it is now in my possession. Signed, Richard
Mason.’”

“That—if a genuine document—may prove I have been married, but it does
not prove that the woman mentioned therein as my wife is still living.”

“She was living three months ago,” returned the lawyer.

“How do you know?”

“I have a witness to the fact, whose testimony even you, sir, will
scarcely controvert.”

“Produce him—or go to hell.”

“I will produce him first—he is on the spot. Mr. Mason, have the
goodness to step forward.”

Mr. Rochester, on hearing the name, set his teeth; he experienced, too,
a sort of strong convulsive quiver; near to him as I was, I felt the
spasmodic movement of fury or despair run through his frame. The second
stranger, who had hitherto lingered in the background, now drew near; a
pale face looked over the solicitor’s shoulder—yes, it was Mason
himself. Mr. Rochester turned and glared at him. His eye, as I have
often said, was a black eye: it had now a tawny, nay, a bloody light in
its gloom; and his face flushed—olive cheek and hueless forehead
received a glow as from spreading, ascending heart-fire: and he
stirred, lifted his strong arm—he could have struck Mason, dashed him
on the church-floor, shocked by ruthless blow the breath from his
body—but Mason shrank away, and cried faintly, “Good God!” Contempt
fell cool on Mr. Rochester—his passion died as if a blight had
shrivelled it up: he only asked—“What have _you_ to say?”

An inaudible reply escaped Mason’s white lips.

“The devil is in it if you cannot answer distinctly. I again demand,
what have _you_ to say?”

“Sir—sir,” interrupted the clergyman, “do not forget you are in a
sacred place.” Then addressing Mason, he inquired gently, “Are you
aware, sir, whether or not this gentleman’s wife is still living?”

“Courage,” urged the lawyer,—“speak out.”

“She is now living at Thornfield Hall,” said Mason, in more articulate
tones: “I saw her there last April. I am her brother.”

“At Thornfield Hall!” ejaculated the clergyman. “Impossible! I am an
old resident in this neighbourhood, sir, and I never heard of a Mrs.
Rochester at Thornfield Hall.”

I saw a grim smile contort Mr. Rochester’s lips, and he muttered—

“No, by God! I took care that none should hear of it—or of her under
that name.” He mused—for ten minutes he held counsel with himself: he
formed his resolve, and announced it—

“Enough! all shall bolt out at once, like the bullet from the barrel.
Wood, close your book and take off your surplice; John Green (to the
clerk), leave the church: there will be no wedding to-day.” The man
obeyed.

Mr. Rochester continued, hardily and recklessly: “Bigamy is an ugly
word!—I meant, however, to be a bigamist; but fate has out-manoeuvred
me, or Providence has checked me,—perhaps the last. I am little better
than a devil at this moment; and, as my pastor there would tell me,
deserve no doubt the sternest judgments of God, even to the quenchless
fire and deathless worm. Gentlemen, my plan is broken up:—what this
lawyer and his client say is true: I have been married, and the woman
to whom I was married lives! You say you never heard of a Mrs.
Rochester at the house up yonder, Wood; but I daresay you have many a
time inclined your ear to gossip about the mysterious lunatic kept
there under watch and ward. Some have whispered to you that she is my
bastard half-sister: some, my cast-off mistress. I now inform you that
she is my wife, whom I married fifteen years ago,—Bertha Mason by name;
sister of this resolute personage, who is now, with his quivering limbs
and white cheeks, showing you what a stout heart men may bear. Cheer
up, Dick!—never fear me!—I’d almost as soon strike a woman as you.
Bertha Mason is mad; and she came of a mad family; idiots and maniacs
through three generations! Her mother, the Creole, was both a madwoman
and a drunkard!—as I found out after I had wed the daughter: for they
were silent on family secrets before. Bertha, like a dutiful child,
copied her parent in both points. I had a charming partner—pure, wise,
modest: you can fancy I was a happy man. I went through rich scenes!
Oh! my experience has been heavenly, if you only knew it! But I owe you
no further explanation. Briggs, Wood, Mason, I invite you all to come
up to the house and visit Mrs. Poole’s patient, and _my wife_! You
shall see what sort of a being I was cheated into espousing, and judge
whether or not I had a right to break the compact, and seek sympathy
with something at least human. This girl,” he continued, looking at me,
“knew no more than you, Wood, of the disgusting secret: she thought all
was fair and legal; and never dreamt she was going to be entrapped into
a feigned union with a defrauded wretch, already bound to a bad, mad,
and embruted partner! Come all of you—follow!”

Still holding me fast, he left the church: the three gentlemen came
after. At the front door of the hall we found the carriage.

“Take it back to the coach-house, John,” said Mr. Rochester coolly; “it
will not be wanted to-day.”

At our entrance, Mrs. Fairfax, Adèle, Sophie, Leah, advanced to meet
and greet us.

“To the right-about—every soul!” cried the master; “away with your
congratulations! Who wants them? Not I!—they are fifteen years too
late!”

He passed on and ascended the stairs, still holding my hand, and still
beckoning the gentlemen to follow him, which they did. We mounted the
first staircase, passed up the gallery, proceeded to the third storey:
the low, black door, opened by Mr. Rochester’s master-key, admitted us
to the tapestried room, with its great bed and its pictorial cabinet.

“You know this place, Mason,” said our guide; “she bit and stabbed you
here.”

He lifted the hangings from the wall, uncovering the second door: this,
too, he opened. In a room without a window, there burnt a fire guarded
by a high and strong fender, and a lamp suspended from the ceiling by a
chain. Grace Poole bent over the fire, apparently cooking something in
a saucepan. In the deep shade, at the farther end of the room, a figure
ran backwards and forwards. What it was, whether beast or human being,
one could not, at first sight, tell: it grovelled, seemingly, on all
fours; it snatched and growled like some strange wild animal: but it
was covered with clothing, and a quantity of dark, grizzled hair, wild
as a mane, hid its head and face.

“Good-morrow, Mrs. Poole!” said Mr. Rochester. “How are you? and how is
your charge to-day?”

“We’re tolerable, sir, I thank you,” replied Grace, lifting the boiling
mess carefully on to the hob: “rather snappish, but not ’rageous.”

A fierce cry seemed to give the lie to her favourable report: the
clothed hyena rose up, and stood tall on its hind-feet.

“Ah! sir, she sees you!” exclaimed Grace: “you’d better not stay.”

“Only a few moments, Grace: you must allow me a few moments.”

“Take care then, sir!—for God’s sake, take care!”

The maniac bellowed: she parted her shaggy locks from her visage, and
gazed wildly at her visitors. I recognised well that purple face,—those
bloated features. Mrs. Poole advanced.

“Keep out of the way,” said Mr. Rochester, thrusting her aside: “she
has no knife now, I suppose, and I’m on my guard.”

“One never knows what she has, sir: she is so cunning: it is not in
mortal discretion to fathom her craft.”

“We had better leave her,” whispered Mason.

“Go to the devil!” was his brother-in-law’s recommendation.

“’Ware!” cried Grace. The three gentlemen retreated simultaneously. Mr.
Rochester flung me behind him: the lunatic sprang and grappled his
throat viciously, and laid her teeth to his cheek: they struggled. She
was a big woman, in stature almost equalling her husband, and corpulent
besides: she showed virile force in the contest—more than once she
almost throttled him, athletic as he was. He could have settled her
with a well-planted blow; but he would not strike: he would only
wrestle. At last he mastered her arms; Grace Poole gave him a cord, and
he pinioned them behind her: with more rope, which was at hand, he
bound her to a chair. The operation was performed amidst the fiercest
yells and the most convulsive plunges. Mr. Rochester then turned to the
spectators: he looked at them with a smile both acrid and desolate.

“That is _my wife_,” said he. “Such is the sole conjugal embrace I am
ever to know—such are the endearments which are to solace my leisure
hours! And _this_ is what I wished to have” (laying his hand on my
shoulder): “this young girl, who stands so grave and quiet at the mouth
of hell, looking collectedly at the gambols of a demon, I wanted her
just as a change after that fierce ragout. Wood and Briggs, look at the
difference! Compare these clear eyes with the red balls yonder—this
face with that mask—this form with that bulk; then judge me, priest of
the gospel and man of the law, and remember with what judgment ye judge
ye shall be judged! Off with you now. I must shut up my prize.”

We all withdrew. Mr. Rochester stayed a moment behind us, to give some
further order to Grace Poole. The solicitor addressed me as he
descended the stair.

“You, madam,” said he, “are cleared from all blame: your uncle will be
glad to hear it—if, indeed, he should be still living—when Mr. Mason
returns to Madeira.”

“My uncle! What of him? Do you know him?”

“Mr. Mason does. Mr. Eyre has been the Funchal correspondent of his
house for some years. When your uncle received your letter intimating
the contemplated union between yourself and Mr. Rochester, Mr. Mason,
who was staying at Madeira to recruit his health, on his way back to
Jamaica, happened to be with him. Mr. Eyre mentioned the intelligence;
for he knew that my client here was acquainted with a gentleman of the
name of Rochester. Mr. Mason, astonished and distressed as you may
suppose, revealed the real state of matters. Your uncle, I am sorry to
say, is now on a sick bed; from which, considering the nature of his
disease—decline—and the stage it has reached, it is unlikely he will
ever rise. He could not then hasten to England himself, to extricate
you from the snare into which you had fallen, but he implored Mr. Mason
to lose no time in taking steps to prevent the false marriage. He
referred him to me for assistance. I used all despatch, and am thankful
I was not too late: as you, doubtless, must be also. Were I not morally
certain that your uncle will be dead ere you reach Madeira, I would
advise you to accompany Mr. Mason back; but as it is, I think you had
better remain in England till you can hear further, either from or of
Mr. Eyre. Have we anything else to stay for?” he inquired of Mr. Mason.

“No, no—let us be gone,” was the anxious reply; and without waiting to
take leave of Mr. Rochester, they made their exit at the hall door. The
clergyman stayed to exchange a few sentences, either of admonition or
reproof, with his haughty parishioner; this duty done, he too departed.

I heard him go as I stood at the half-open door of my own room, to
which I had now withdrawn. The house cleared, I shut myself in,
fastened the bolt that none might intrude, and proceeded—not to weep,
not to mourn, I was yet too calm for that, but—mechanically to take off
the wedding dress, and replace it by the stuff gown I had worn
yesterday, as I thought, for the last time. I then sat down: I felt
weak and tired. I leaned my arms on a table, and my head dropped on
them. And now I thought: till now I had only heard, seen,
moved—followed up and down where I was led or dragged—watched event
rush on event, disclosure open beyond disclosure: but _now_, _I
thought_.

The morning had been a quiet morning enough—all except the brief scene
with the lunatic: the transaction in the church had not been noisy;
there was no explosion of passion, no loud altercation, no dispute, no
defiance or challenge, no tears, no sobs: a few words had been spoken,
a calmly pronounced objection to the marriage made; some stern, short
questions put by Mr. Rochester; answers, explanations given, evidence
adduced; an open admission of the truth had been uttered by my master;
then the living proof had been seen; the intruders were gone, and all
was over.

I was in my own room as usual—just myself, without obvious change:
nothing had smitten me, or scathed me, or maimed me. And yet where was
the Jane Eyre of yesterday?—where was her life?—where were her
prospects?

Jane Eyre, who had been an ardent, expectant woman—almost a bride, was
a cold, solitary girl again: her life was pale; her prospects were
desolate. A Christmas frost had come at midsummer; a white December
storm had whirled over June; ice glazed the ripe apples, drifts crushed
the blowing roses; on hayfield and cornfield lay a frozen shroud: lanes
which last night blushed full of flowers, to-day were pathless with
untrodden snow; and the woods, which twelve hours since waved leafy and
fragrant as groves between the tropics, now spread, waste, wild, and
white as pine-forests in wintry Norway. My hopes were all dead—struck
with a subtle doom, such as, in one night, fell on all the first-born
in the land of Egypt. I looked on my cherished wishes, yesterday so
blooming and glowing; they lay stark, chill, livid corpses that could
never revive. I looked at my love: that feeling which was my
master’s—which he had created; it shivered in my heart, like a
suffering child in a cold cradle; sickness and anguish had seized it;
it could not seek Mr. Rochester’s arms—it could not derive warmth from
his breast. Oh, never more could it turn to him; for faith was
blighted—confidence destroyed! Mr. Rochester was not to me what he had
been; for he was not what I had thought him. I would not ascribe vice
to him; I would not say he had betrayed me; but the attribute of
stainless truth was gone from his idea, and from his presence I must
go: _that_ I perceived well. When—how—whither, I could not yet discern;
but he himself, I doubted not, would hurry me from Thornfield. Real
affection, it seemed, he could not have for me; it had been only fitful
passion: that was balked; he would want me no more. I should fear even
to cross his path now: my view must be hateful to him. Oh, how blind
had been my eyes! How weak my conduct!

My eyes were covered and closed: eddying darkness seemed to swim round
me, and reflection came in as black and confused a flow.
Self-abandoned, relaxed, and effortless, I seemed to have laid me down
in the dried-up bed of a great river; I heard a flood loosened in
remote mountains, and felt the torrent come: to rise I had no will, to
flee I had no strength. I lay faint, longing to be dead. One idea only
still throbbed life-like within me—a remembrance of God: it begot an
unuttered prayer: these words went wandering up and down in my rayless
mind, as something that should be whispered, but no energy was found to
express them—

“Be not far from me, for trouble is near: there is none to help.”

It was near: and as I had lifted no petition to Heaven to avert it—as I
had neither joined my hands, nor bent my knees, nor moved my lips—it
came: in full heavy swing the torrent poured over me. The whole
consciousness of my life lorn, my love lost, my hope quenched, my faith
death-struck, swayed full and mighty above me in one sullen mass. That
bitter hour cannot be described: in truth, “the waters came into my
soul; I sank in deep mire: I felt no standing; I came into deep waters;
the floods overflowed me.”




CHAPTER XXVII


Some time in the afternoon I raised my head, and looking round and
seeing the western sun gilding the sign of its decline on the wall, I
asked, “What am I to do?”

But the answer my mind gave—“Leave Thornfield at once”—was so prompt,
so dread, that I stopped my ears. I said I could not bear such words
now. “That I am not Edward Rochester’s bride is the least part of my
woe,” I alleged: “that I have wakened out of most glorious dreams, and
found them all void and vain, is a horror I could bear and master; but
that I must leave him decidedly, instantly, entirely, is intolerable. I
cannot do it.”

But, then, a voice within me averred that I could do it and foretold
that I should do it. I wrestled with my own resolution: I wanted to be
weak that I might avoid the awful passage of further suffering I saw
laid out for me; and Conscience, turned tyrant, held Passion by the
throat, told her tauntingly, she had yet but dipped her dainty foot in
the slough, and swore that with that arm of iron he would thrust her
down to unsounded depths of agony.

“Let me be torn away, then” I cried. “Let another help me!”

“No; you shall tear yourself away, none shall help you: you shall
yourself pluck out your right eye; yourself cut off your right hand:
your heart shall be the victim, and you the priest to transfix it.”

I rose up suddenly, terror-struck at the solitude which so ruthless a
judge haunted,—at the silence which so awful a voice filled. My head
swam as I stood erect. I perceived that I was sickening from excitement
and inanition; neither meat nor drink had passed my lips that day, for
I had taken no breakfast. And, with a strange pang, I now reflected
that, long as I had been shut up here, no message had been sent to ask
how I was, or to invite me to come down: not even little Adèle had
tapped at the door; not even Mrs. Fairfax had sought me. “Friends
always forget those whom fortune forsakes,” I murmured, as I undrew the
bolt and passed out. I stumbled over an obstacle: my head was still
dizzy, my sight was dim, and my limbs were feeble. I could not soon
recover myself. I fell, but not on to the ground: an outstretched arm
caught me. I looked up—I was supported by Mr. Rochester, who sat in a
chair across my chamber threshold.

“You come out at last,” he said. “Well, I have been waiting for you
long, and listening: yet not one movement have I heard, nor one sob:
five minutes more of that death-like hush, and I should have forced the
lock like a burglar. So you shun me?—you shut yourself up and grieve
alone! I would rather you had come and upbraided me with vehemence. You
are passionate: I expected a scene of some kind. I was prepared for the
hot rain of tears; only I wanted them to be shed on my breast: now a
senseless floor has received them, or your drenched handkerchief. But I
err: you have not wept at all! I see a white cheek and a faded eye, but
no trace of tears. I suppose, then, your heart has been weeping blood?”

“Well, Jane! not a word of reproach? Nothing bitter—nothing poignant?
Nothing to cut a feeling or sting a passion? You sit quietly where I
have placed you, and regard me with a weary, passive look.

“Jane, I never meant to wound you thus. If the man who had but one
little ewe lamb that was dear to him as a daughter, that ate of his
bread and drank of his cup, and lay in his bosom, had by some mistake
slaughtered it at the shambles, he would not have rued his bloody
blunder more than I now rue mine. Will you ever forgive me?”

Reader, I forgave him at the moment and on the spot. There was such
deep remorse in his eye, such true pity in his tone, such manly energy
in his manner; and besides, there was such unchanged love in his whole
look and mien—I forgave him all: yet not in words, not outwardly; only
at my heart’s core.

“You know I am a scoundrel, Jane?” ere long he inquired
wistfully—wondering, I suppose, at my continued silence and tameness,
the result rather of weakness than of will.

“Yes, sir.”

“Then tell me so roundly and sharply—don’t spare me.”

“I cannot: I am tired and sick. I want some water.” He heaved a sort of
shuddering sigh, and taking me in his arms, carried me downstairs. At
first I did not know to what room he had borne me; all was cloudy to my
glazed sight: presently I felt the reviving warmth of a fire; for,
summer as it was, I had become icy cold in my chamber. He put wine to
my lips; I tasted it and revived; then I ate something he offered me,
and was soon myself. I was in the library—sitting in his chair—he was
quite near. “If I could go out of life now, without too sharp a pang,
it would be well for me,” I thought; “then I should not have to make
the effort of cracking my heart-strings in rending them from among Mr.
Rochester’s. I must leave him, it appears. I do not want to leave him—I
cannot leave him.”

“How are you now, Jane?”

“Much better, sir; I shall be well soon.”

“Taste the wine again, Jane.”

I obeyed him; then he put the glass on the table, stood before me, and
looked at me attentively. Suddenly he turned away, with an inarticulate
exclamation, full of passionate emotion of some kind; he walked fast
through the room and came back; he stooped towards me as if to kiss me;
but I remembered caresses were now forbidden. I turned my face away and
put his aside.

“What!—How is this?” he exclaimed hastily. “Oh, I know! you won’t kiss
the husband of Bertha Mason? You consider my arms filled and my
embraces appropriated?”

“At any rate, there is neither room nor claim for me, sir.”

“Why, Jane? I will spare you the trouble of much talking; I will answer
for you—Because I have a wife already, you would reply.—I guess
rightly?”

“Yes.”

“If you think so, you must have a strange opinion of me; you must
regard me as a plotting profligate—a base and low rake who has been
simulating disinterested love in order to draw you into a snare
deliberately laid, and strip you of honour and rob you of self-respect.
What do you say to that? I see you can say nothing: in the first place,
you are faint still, and have enough to do to draw your breath; in the
second place, you cannot yet accustom yourself to accuse and revile me,
and besides, the flood-gates of tears are opened, and they would rush
out if you spoke much; and you have no desire to expostulate, to
upbraid, to make a scene: you are thinking how _to act_—_talking_ you
consider is of no use. I know you—I am on my guard.”

“Sir, I do not wish to act against you,” I said; and my unsteady voice
warned me to curtail my sentence.

“Not in _your_ sense of the word, but in _mine_ you are scheming to
destroy me. You have as good as said that I am a married man—as a
married man you will shun me, keep out of my way: just now you have
refused to kiss me. You intend to make yourself a complete stranger to
me: to live under this roof only as Adèle’s governess; if ever I say a
friendly word to you, if ever a friendly feeling inclines you again to
me, you will say,—‘That man had nearly made me his mistress: I must be
ice and rock to him;’ and ice and rock you will accordingly become.”

I cleared and steadied my voice to reply: “All is changed about me,
sir; I must change too—there is no doubt of that; and to avoid
fluctuations of feeling, and continual combats with recollections and
associations, there is only one way—Adèle must have a new governess,
sir.”

“Oh, Adèle will go to school—I have settled that already; nor do I mean
to torment you with the hideous associations and recollections of
Thornfield Hall—this accursed place—this tent of Achan—this insolent
vault, offering the ghastliness of living death to the light of the
open sky—this narrow stone hell, with its one real fiend, worse than a
legion of such as we imagine. Jane, you shall not stay here, nor will
I. I was wrong ever to bring you to Thornfield Hall, knowing as I did
how it was haunted. I charged them to conceal from you, before I ever
saw you, all knowledge of the curse of the place; merely because I
feared Adèle never would have a governess to stay if she knew with what
inmate she was housed, and my plans would not permit me to remove the
maniac elsewhere—though I possess an old house, Ferndean Manor, even
more retired and hidden than this, where I could have lodged her safely
enough, had not a scruple about the unhealthiness of the situation, in
the heart of a wood, made my conscience recoil from the arrangement.
Probably those damp walls would soon have eased me of her charge: but
to each villain his own vice; and mine is not a tendency to indirect
assassination, even of what I most hate.

“Concealing the mad-woman’s neighbourhood from you, however, was
something like covering a child with a cloak and laying it down near a
upas-tree: that demon’s vicinage is poisoned, and always was. But I’ll
shut up Thornfield Hall: I’ll nail up the front door and board the
lower windows: I’ll give Mrs. Poole two hundred a year to live here
with _my wife_, as you term that fearful hag: Grace will do much for
money, and she shall have her son, the keeper at Grimsby Retreat, to
bear her company and be at hand to give her aid in the paroxysms, when
_my wife_ is prompted by her familiar to burn people in their beds at
night, to stab them, to bite their flesh from their bones, and so on—”

“Sir,” I interrupted him, “you are inexorable for that unfortunate
lady: you speak of her with hate—with vindictive antipathy. It is
cruel—she cannot help being mad.”

“Jane, my little darling (so I will call you, for so you are), you
don’t know what you are talking about; you misjudge me again: it is not
because she is mad I hate her. If you were mad, do you think I should
hate you?”

“I do indeed, sir.”

“Then you are mistaken, and you know nothing about me, and nothing
about the sort of love of which I am capable. Every atom of your flesh
is as dear to me as my own: in pain and sickness it would still be
dear. Your mind is my treasure, and if it were broken, it would be my
treasure still: if you raved, my arms should confine you, and not a
strait waistcoat—your grasp, even in fury, would have a charm for me:
if you flew at me as wildly as that woman did this morning, I should
receive you in an embrace, at least as fond as it would be restrictive.
I should not shrink from you with disgust as I did from her: in your
quiet moments you should have no watcher and no nurse but me; and I
could hang over you with untiring tenderness, though you gave me no
smile in return; and never weary of gazing into your eyes, though they
had no longer a ray of recognition for me.—But why do I follow that
train of ideas? I was talking of removing you from Thornfield. All, you
know, is prepared for prompt departure: to-morrow you shall go. I only
ask you to endure one more night under this roof, Jane; and then,
farewell to its miseries and terrors for ever! I have a place to repair
to, which will be a secure sanctuary from hateful reminiscences, from
unwelcome intrusion—even from falsehood and slander.”

“And take Adèle with you, sir,” I interrupted; “she will be a companion
for you.”

“What do you mean, Jane? I told you I would send Adèle to school; and
what do I want with a child for a companion, and not my own child,—a
French dancer’s bastard? Why do you importune me about her! I say, why
do you assign Adèle to me for a companion?”

“You spoke of a retirement, sir; and retirement and solitude are dull:
too dull for you.”

“Solitude! solitude!” he reiterated with irritation. “I see I must come
to an explanation. I don’t know what sphynx-like expression is forming
in your countenance. _You_ are to share my solitude. Do you
understand?”

I shook my head: it required a degree of courage, excited as he was
becoming, even to risk that mute sign of dissent. He had been walking
fast about the room, and he stopped, as if suddenly rooted to one spot.
He looked at me long and hard: I turned my eyes from him, fixed them on
the fire, and tried to assume and maintain a quiet, collected aspect.

“Now for the hitch in Jane’s character,” he said at last, speaking more
calmly than from his look I had expected him to speak. “The reel of
silk has run smoothly enough so far; but I always knew there would come
a knot and a puzzle: here it is. Now for vexation, and exasperation,
and endless trouble! By God! I long to exert a fraction of Samson’s
strength, and break the entanglement like tow!”

He recommenced his walk, but soon again stopped, and this time just
before me.

“Jane! will you hear reason?” (he stooped and approached his lips to my
ear); “because, if you won’t, I’ll try violence.” His voice was hoarse;
his look that of a man who is just about to burst an insufferable bond
and plunge headlong into wild license. I saw that in another moment,
and with one impetus of frenzy more, I should be able to do nothing
with him. The present—the passing second of time—was all I had in which
to control and restrain him: a movement of repulsion, flight, fear
would have sealed my doom,—and his. But I was not afraid: not in the
least. I felt an inward power; a sense of influence, which supported
me. The crisis was perilous; but not without its charm: such as the
Indian, perhaps, feels when he slips over the rapid in his canoe. I
took hold of his clenched hand, loosened the contorted fingers, and
said to him, soothingly—

“Sit down; I’ll talk to you as long as you like, and hear all you have
to say, whether reasonable or unreasonable.”

He sat down: but he did not get leave to speak directly. I had been
struggling with tears for some time: I had taken great pains to repress
them, because I knew he would not like to see me weep. Now, however, I
considered it well to let them flow as freely and as long as they
liked. If the flood annoyed him, so much the better. So I gave way and
cried heartily.

Soon I heard him earnestly entreating me to be composed. I said I could
not while he was in such a passion.

“But I am not angry, Jane: I only love you too well; and you had
steeled your little pale face with such a resolute, frozen look, I
could not endure it. Hush, now, and wipe your eyes.”

His softened voice announced that he was subdued; so I, in my turn,
became calm. Now he made an effort to rest his head on my shoulder, but
I would not permit it. Then he would draw me to him: no.

“Jane! Jane!” he said, in such an accent of bitter sadness it thrilled
along every nerve I had; “you don’t love me, then? It was only my
station, and the rank of my wife, that you valued? Now that you think
me disqualified to become your husband, you recoil from my touch as if
I were some toad or ape.”

These words cut me: yet what could I do or I say? I ought probably to
have done or said nothing; but I was so tortured by a sense of remorse
at thus hurting his feelings, I could not control the wish to drop balm
where I had wounded.

“I _do_ love you,” I said, “more than ever: but I must not show or
indulge the feeling: and this is the last time I must express it.”

“The last time, Jane! What! do you think you can live with me, and see
me daily, and yet, if you still love me, be always cold and distant?”

“No, sir; that I am certain I could not; and therefore I see there is
but one way: but you will be furious if I mention it.”

“Oh, mention it! If I storm, you have the art of weeping.”

“Mr. Rochester, I must leave you.”

“For how long, Jane? For a few minutes, while you smooth your
hair—which is somewhat dishevelled; and bathe your face—which looks
feverish?”

“I must leave Adèle and Thornfield. I must part with you for my whole
life: I must begin a new existence among strange faces and strange
scenes.”

“Of course: I told you you should. I pass over the madness about
parting from me. You mean you must become a part of me. As to the new
existence, it is all right: you shall yet be my wife: I am not married.
You shall be Mrs. Rochester—both virtually and nominally. I shall keep
only to you so long as you and I live. You shall go to a place I have
in the south of France: a whitewashed villa on the shores of the
Mediterranean. There you shall live a happy, and guarded, and most
innocent life. Never fear that I wish to lure you into error—to make
you my mistress. Why did you shake your head? Jane, you must be
reasonable, or in truth I shall again become frantic.”

His voice and hand quivered: his large nostrils dilated; his eye
blazed: still I dared to speak.

“Sir, your wife is living: that is a fact acknowledged this morning by
yourself. If I lived with you as you desire, I should then be your
mistress: to say otherwise is sophistical—is false.”

“Jane, I am not a gentle-tempered man—you forget that: I am not
long-enduring; I am not cool and dispassionate. Out of pity to me and
yourself, put your finger on my pulse, feel how it throbs, and—beware!”

He bared his wrist, and offered it to me: the blood was forsaking his
cheek and lips, they were growing livid; I was distressed on all hands.
To agitate him thus deeply, by a resistance he so abhorred, was cruel:
to yield was out of the question. I did what human beings do
instinctively when they are driven to utter extremity—looked for aid to
one higher than man: the words “God help me!” burst involuntarily from
my lips.

“I am a fool!” cried Mr. Rochester suddenly. “I keep telling her I am
not married, and do not explain to her why. I forget she knows nothing
of the character of that woman, or of the circumstances attending my
infernal union with her. Oh, I am certain Jane will agree with me in
opinion, when she knows all that I know! Just put your hand in mine,
Janet—that I may have the evidence of touch as well as sight, to prove
you are near me—and I will in a few words show you the real state of
the case. Can you listen to me?”

“Yes, sir; for hours if you will.”

“I ask only minutes. Jane, did you ever hear or know that I was not the
eldest son of my house: that I had once a brother older than I?”

“I remember Mrs. Fairfax told me so once.”

“And did you ever hear that my father was an avaricious, grasping man?”

“I have understood something to that effect.”

“Well, Jane, being so, it was his resolution to keep the property
together; he could not bear the idea of dividing his estate and leaving
me a fair portion: all, he resolved, should go to my brother, Rowland.
Yet as little could he endure that a son of his should be a poor man. I
must be provided for by a wealthy marriage. He sought me a partner
betimes. Mr. Mason, a West India planter and merchant, was his old
acquaintance. He was certain his possessions were real and vast: he
made inquiries. Mr. Mason, he found, had a son and daughter; and he
learned from him that he could and would give the latter a fortune of
thirty thousand pounds: that sufficed. When I left college, I was sent
out to Jamaica, to espouse a bride already courted for me. My father
said nothing about her money; but he told me Miss Mason was the boast
of Spanish Town for her beauty: and this was no lie. I found her a fine
woman, in the style of Blanche Ingram: tall, dark, and majestic. Her
family wished to secure me because I was of a good race; and so did
she. They showed her to me in parties, splendidly dressed. I seldom saw
her alone, and had very little private conversation with her. She
flattered me, and lavishly displayed for my pleasure her charms and
accomplishments. All the men in her circle seemed to admire her and
envy me. I was dazzled, stimulated: my senses were excited; and being
ignorant, raw, and inexperienced, I thought I loved her. There is no
folly so besotted that the idiotic rivalries of society, the prurience,
the rashness, the blindness of youth, will not hurry a man to its
commission. Her relatives encouraged me; competitors piqued me; she
allured me: a marriage was achieved almost before I knew where I was.
Oh, I have no respect for myself when I think of that act!—an agony of
inward contempt masters me. I never loved, I never esteemed, I did not
even know her. I was not sure of the existence of one virtue in her
nature: I had marked neither modesty, nor benevolence, nor candour, nor
refinement in her mind or manners—and, I married her:—gross,
grovelling, mole-eyed blockhead that I was! With less sin I might
have—But let me remember to whom I am speaking.

“My bride’s mother I had never seen: I understood she was dead. The
honeymoon over, I learned my mistake; she was only mad, and shut up in
a lunatic asylum. There was a younger brother, too—a complete dumb
idiot. The elder one, whom you have seen (and whom I cannot hate,
whilst I abhor all his kindred, because he has some grains of affection
in his feeble mind, shown in the continued interest he takes in his
wretched sister, and also in a dog-like attachment he once bore me),
will probably be in the same state one day. My father and my brother
Rowland knew all this; but they thought only of the thirty thousand
pounds, and joined in the plot against me.

“These were vile discoveries; but except for the treachery of
concealment, I should have made them no subject of reproach to my wife,
even when I found her nature wholly alien to mine, her tastes obnoxious
to me, her cast of mind common, low, narrow, and singularly incapable
of being led to anything higher, expanded to anything larger—when I
found that I could not pass a single evening, nor even a single hour of
the day with her in comfort; that kindly conversation could not be
sustained between us, because whatever topic I started, immediately
received from her a turn at once coarse and trite, perverse and
imbecile—when I perceived that I should never have a quiet or settled
household, because no servant would bear the continued outbreaks of her
violent and unreasonable temper, or the vexations of her absurd,
contradictory, exacting orders—even then I restrained myself: I
eschewed upbraiding, I curtailed remonstrance; I tried to devour my
repentance and disgust in secret; I repressed the deep antipathy I
felt.

“Jane, I will not trouble you with abominable details: some strong
words shall express what I have to say. I lived with that woman
upstairs four years, and before that time she had tried me indeed: her
character ripened and developed with frightful rapidity; her vices
sprang up fast and rank: they were so strong, only cruelty could check
them, and I would not use cruelty. What a pigmy intellect she had, and
what giant propensities! How fearful were the curses those propensities
entailed on me! Bertha Mason, the true daughter of an infamous mother,
dragged me through all the hideous and degrading agonies which must
attend a man bound to a wife at once intemperate and unchaste.

“My brother in the interval was dead, and at the end of the four years
my father died too. I was rich enough now—yet poor to hideous
indigence: a nature the most gross, impure, depraved I ever saw, was
associated with mine, and called by the law and by society a part of
me. And I could not rid myself of it by any legal proceedings: for the
doctors now discovered that _my wife_ was mad—her excesses had
prematurely developed the germs of insanity. Jane, you don’t like my
narrative; you look almost sick—shall I defer the rest to another day?”

“No, sir, finish it now; I pity you—I do earnestly pity you.”

“Pity, Jane, from some people is a noxious and insulting sort of
tribute, which one is justified in hurling back in the teeth of those
who offer it; but that is the sort of pity native to callous, selfish
hearts; it is a hybrid, egotistical pain at hearing of woes, crossed
with ignorant contempt for those who have endured them. But that is not
your pity, Jane; it is not the feeling of which your whole face is full
at this moment—with which your eyes are now almost overflowing—with
which your heart is heaving—with which your hand is trembling in mine.
Your pity, my darling, is the suffering mother of love: its anguish is
the very natal pang of the divine passion. I accept it, Jane; let the
daughter have free advent—my arms wait to receive her.”

“Now, sir, proceed; what did you do when you found she was mad?”

“Jane, I approached the verge of despair; a remnant of self-respect was
all that intervened between me and the gulf. In the eyes of the world,
I was doubtless covered with grimy dishonour; but I resolved to be
clean in my own sight—and to the last I repudiated the contamination of
her crimes, and wrenched myself from connection with her mental
defects. Still, society associated my name and person with hers; I yet
saw her and heard her daily: something of her breath (faugh!) mixed
with the air I breathed; and besides, I remembered I had once been her
husband—that recollection was then, and is now, inexpressibly odious to
me; moreover, I knew that while she lived I could never be the husband
of another and better wife; and, though five years my senior (her
family and her father had lied to me even in the particular of her
age), she was likely to live as long as I, being as robust in frame as
she was infirm in mind. Thus, at the age of twenty-six, I was hopeless.

“One night I had been awakened by her yells—(since the medical men had
pronounced her mad, she had, of course, been shut up)—it was a fiery
West Indian night; one of the description that frequently precede the
hurricanes of those climates. Being unable to sleep in bed, I got up
and opened the window. The air was like sulphur-steams—I could find no
refreshment anywhere. Mosquitoes came buzzing in and hummed sullenly
round the room; the sea, which I could hear from thence, rumbled dull
like an earthquake—black clouds were casting up over it; the moon was
setting in the waves, broad and red, like a hot cannon-ball—she threw
her last bloody glance over a world quivering with the ferment of
tempest. I was physically influenced by the atmosphere and scene, and
my ears were filled with the curses the maniac still shrieked out;
wherein she momentarily mingled my name with such a tone of demon-hate,
with such language!—no professed harlot ever had a fouler vocabulary
than she: though two rooms off, I heard every word—the thin partitions
of the West India house opposing but slight obstruction to her wolfish
cries.

“‘This life,’ said I at last, ‘is hell: this is the air—those are the
sounds of the bottomless pit! I have a right to deliver myself from it
if I can. The sufferings of this mortal state will leave me with the
heavy flesh that now cumbers my soul. Of the fanatic’s burning eternity
I have no fear: there is not a future state worse than this present
one—let me break away, and go home to God!’

“I said this whilst I knelt down at, and unlocked a trunk which
contained a brace of loaded pistols: I meant to shoot myself. I only
entertained the intention for a moment; for, not being insane, the
crisis of exquisite and unalloyed despair, which had originated the
wish and design of self-destruction, was past in a second.

“A wind fresh from Europe blew over the ocean and rushed through the
open casement: the storm broke, streamed, thundered, blazed, and the
air grew pure. I then framed and fixed a resolution. While I walked
under the dripping orange-trees of my wet garden, and amongst its
drenched pomegranates and pine-apples, and while the refulgent dawn of
the tropics kindled round me—I reasoned thus, Jane—and now listen; for
it was true Wisdom that consoled me in that hour, and showed me the
right path to follow.

“The sweet wind from Europe was still whispering in the refreshed
leaves, and the Atlantic was thundering in glorious liberty; my heart,
dried up and scorched for a long time, swelled to the tone, and filled
with living blood—my being longed for renewal—my soul thirsted for a
pure draught. I saw hope revive—and felt regeneration possible. From a
flowery arch at the bottom of my garden I gazed over the sea—bluer than
the sky: the old world was beyond; clear prospects opened thus:—

“‘Go,’ said Hope, ‘and live again in Europe: there it is not known what
a sullied name you bear, nor what a filthy burden is bound to you. You
may take the maniac with you to England; confine her with due
attendance and precautions at Thornfield: then travel yourself to what
clime you will, and form what new tie you like. That woman, who has so
abused your long-suffering, so sullied your name, so outraged your
honour, so blighted your youth, is not your wife, nor are you her
husband. See that she is cared for as her condition demands, and you
have done all that God and humanity require of you. Let her identity,
her connection with yourself, be buried in oblivion: you are bound to
impart them to no living being. Place her in safety and comfort:
shelter her degradation with secrecy, and leave her.’

“I acted precisely on this suggestion. My father and brother had not
made my marriage known to their acquaintance; because, in the very
first letter I wrote to apprise them of the union—having already begun
to experience extreme disgust of its consequences, and, from the family
character and constitution, seeing a hideous future opening to me—I
added an urgent charge to keep it secret: and very soon the infamous
conduct of the wife my father had selected for me was such as to make
him blush to own her as his daughter-in-law. Far from desiring to
publish the connection, he became as anxious to conceal it as myself.

“To England, then, I conveyed her; a fearful voyage I had with such a
monster in the vessel. Glad was I when I at last got her to Thornfield,
and saw her safely lodged in that third-storey room, of whose secret
inner cabinet she has now for ten years made a wild beast’s den—a
goblin’s cell. I had some trouble in finding an attendant for her, as
it was necessary to select one on whose fidelity dependence could be
placed; for her ravings would inevitably betray my secret: besides, she
had lucid intervals of days—sometimes weeks—which she filled up with
abuse of me. At last I hired Grace Poole from the Grimbsy Retreat. She
and the surgeon, Carter (who dressed Mason’s wounds that night he was
stabbed and worried), are the only two I have ever admitted to my
confidence. Mrs. Fairfax may indeed have suspected something, but she
could have gained no precise knowledge as to facts. Grace has, on the
whole, proved a good keeper; though, owing partly to a fault of her
own, of which it appears nothing can cure her, and which is incident to
her harassing profession, her vigilance has been more than once lulled
and baffled. The lunatic is both cunning and malignant; she has never
failed to take advantage of her guardian’s temporary lapses; once to
secrete the knife with which she stabbed her brother, and twice to
possess herself of the key of her cell, and issue therefrom in the
night-time. On the first of these occasions, she perpetrated the
attempt to burn me in my bed; on the second, she paid that ghastly
visit to you. I thank Providence, who watched over you, that she then
spent her fury on your wedding apparel, which perhaps brought back
vague reminiscences of her own bridal days: but on what might have
happened, I cannot endure to reflect. When I think of the thing which
flew at my throat this morning, hanging its black and scarlet visage
over the nest of my dove, my blood curdles—”

“And what, sir,” I asked, while he paused, “did you do when you had
settled her here? Where did you go?”

“What did I do, Jane? I transformed myself into a will-o’-the-wisp.
Where did I go? I pursued wanderings as wild as those of the
March-spirit. I sought the Continent, and went devious through all its
lands. My fixed desire was to seek and find a good and intelligent
woman, whom I could love: a contrast to the fury I left at Thornfield—”

“But you could not marry, sir.”

“I had determined and was convinced that I could and ought. It was not
my original intention to deceive, as I have deceived you. I meant to
tell my tale plainly, and make my proposals openly: and it appeared to
me so absolutely rational that I should be considered free to love and
be loved, I never doubted some woman might be found willing and able to
understand my case and accept me, in spite of the curse with which I
was burdened.”

“Well, sir?”

“When you are inquisitive, Jane, you always make me smile. You open
your eyes like an eager bird, and make every now and then a restless
movement, as if answers in speech did not flow fast enough for you, and
you wanted to read the tablet of one’s heart. But before I go on, tell
me what you mean by your ‘Well, sir?’ It is a small phrase very
frequent with you; and which many a time has drawn me on and on through
interminable talk: I don’t very well know why.”

“I mean,—What next? How did you proceed? What came of such an event?”

“Precisely! and what do you wish to know now?”

“Whether you found any one you liked: whether you asked her to marry
you; and what she said.”

“I can tell you whether I found any one I liked, and whether I asked
her to marry me: but what she said is yet to be recorded in the book of
Fate. For ten long years I roved about, living first in one capital,
then another: sometimes in St. Petersburg; oftener in Paris;
occasionally in Rome, Naples, and Florence. Provided with plenty of
money and the passport of an old name, I could choose my own society:
no circles were closed against me. I sought my ideal of a woman amongst
English ladies, French countesses, Italian signoras, and German
gräfinnen. I could not find her. Sometimes, for a fleeting moment, I
thought I caught a glance, heard a tone, beheld a form, which announced
the realisation of my dream: but I was presently undeceived. You are
not to suppose that I desired perfection, either of mind or person. I
longed only for what suited me—for the antipodes of the Creole: and I
longed vainly. Amongst them all I found not one whom, had I been ever
so free, I—warned as I was of the risks, the horrors, the loathings of
incongruous unions—would have asked to marry me. Disappointment made me
reckless. I tried dissipation—never debauchery: that I hated, and hate.
That was my Indian Messalina’s attribute: rooted disgust at it and her
restrained me much, even in pleasure. Any enjoyment that bordered on
riot seemed to approach me to her and her vices, and I eschewed it.

“Yet I could not live alone; so I tried the companionship of
mistresses. The first I chose was Céline Varens—another of those steps
which make a man spurn himself when he recalls them. You already know
what she was, and how my liaison with her terminated. She had two
successors: an Italian, Giacinta, and a German, Clara; both considered
singularly handsome. What was their beauty to me in a few weeks?
Giacinta was unprincipled and violent: I tired of her in three months.
Clara was honest and quiet; but heavy, mindless, and unimpressible: not
one whit to my taste. I was glad to give her a sufficient sum to set
her up in a good line of business, and so get decently rid of her. But,
Jane, I see by your face you are not forming a very favourable opinion
of me just now. You think me an unfeeling, loose-principled rake: don’t
you?”

“I don’t like you so well as I have done sometimes, indeed, sir. Did it
not seem to you in the least wrong to live in that way, first with one
mistress and then another? You talk of it as a mere matter of course.”

“It was with me; and I did not like it. It was a grovelling fashion of
existence: I should never like to return to it. Hiring a mistress is
the next worse thing to buying a slave: both are often by nature, and
always by position, inferior: and to live familiarly with inferiors is
degrading. I now hate the recollection of the time I passed with
Céline, Giacinta, and Clara.”

I felt the truth of these words; and I drew from them the certain
inference, that if I were so far to forget myself and all the teaching
that had ever been instilled into me, as—under any pretext—with any
justification—through any temptation—to become the successor of these
poor girls, he would one day regard me with the same feeling which now
in his mind desecrated their memory. I did not give utterance to this
conviction: it was enough to feel it. I impressed it on my heart, that
it might remain there to serve me as aid in the time of trial.

“Now, Jane, why don’t you say ‘Well, sir?’ I have not done. You are
looking grave. You disapprove of me still, I see. But let me come to
the point. Last January, rid of all mistresses—in a harsh, bitter frame
of mind, the result of a useless, roving, lonely life—corroded with
disappointment, sourly disposed against all men, and especially against
all _woman_kind (for I began to regard the notion of an intellectual,
faithful, loving woman as a mere dream), recalled by business, I came
back to England.

“On a frosty winter afternoon, I rode in sight of Thornfield Hall.
Abhorred spot! I expected no peace—no pleasure there. On a stile in Hay
Lane I saw a quiet little figure sitting by itself. I passed it as
negligently as I did the pollard willow opposite to it: I had no
presentiment of what it would be to me; no inward warning that the
arbitress of my life—my genius for good or evil—waited there in humble
guise. I did not know it, even when, on the occasion of Mesrour’s
accident, it came up and gravely offered me help. Childish and slender
creature! It seemed as if a linnet had hopped to my foot and proposed
to bear me on its tiny wing. I was surly; but the thing would not go:
it stood by me with strange perseverance, and looked and spoke with a
sort of authority. I must be aided, and by that hand: and aided I was.

“When once I had pressed the frail shoulder, something new—a fresh sap
and sense—stole into my frame. It was well I had learnt that this elf
must return to me—that it belonged to my house down below—or I could
not have felt it pass away from under my hand, and seen it vanish
behind the dim hedge, without singular regret. I heard you come home
that night, Jane, though probably you were not aware that I thought of
you or watched for you. The next day I observed you—myself unseen—for
half-an-hour, while you played with Adèle in the gallery. It was a
snowy day, I recollect, and you could not go out of doors. I was in my
room; the door was ajar: I could both listen and watch. Adèle claimed
your outward attention for a while; yet I fancied your thoughts were
elsewhere: but you were very patient with her, my little Jane; you
talked to her and amused her a long time. When at last she left you,
you lapsed at once into deep reverie: you betook yourself slowly to
pace the gallery. Now and then, in passing a casement, you glanced out
at the thick-falling snow; you listened to the sobbing wind, and again
you paced gently on and dreamed. I think those day visions were not
dark: there was a pleasurable illumination in your eye occasionally, a
soft excitement in your aspect, which told of no bitter, bilious,
hypochondriac brooding: your look revealed rather the sweet musings of
youth when its spirit follows on willing wings the flight of Hope up
and on to an ideal heaven. The voice of Mrs. Fairfax, speaking to a
servant in the hall, wakened you: and how curiously you smiled to and
at yourself, Janet! There was much sense in your smile: it was very
shrewd, and seemed to make light of your own abstraction. It seemed to
say—‘My fine visions are all very well, but I must not forget they are
absolutely unreal. I have a rosy sky and a green flowery Eden in my
brain; but without, I am perfectly aware, lies at my feet a rough tract
to travel, and around me gather black tempests to encounter.’ You ran
downstairs and demanded of Mrs. Fairfax some occupation: the weekly
house accounts to make up, or something of that sort, I think it was. I
was vexed with you for getting out of my sight.

“Impatiently I waited for evening, when I might summon you to my
presence. An unusual—to me—a perfectly new character I suspected was
yours: I desired to search it deeper and know it better. You entered
the room with a look and air at once shy and independent: you were
quaintly dressed—much as you are now. I made you talk: ere long I found
you full of strange contrasts. Your garb and manner were restricted by
rule; your air was often diffident, and altogether that of one refined
by nature, but absolutely unused to society, and a good deal afraid of
making herself disadvantageously conspicuous by some solecism or
blunder; yet when addressed, you lifted a keen, a daring, and a glowing
eye to your interlocutor’s face: there was penetration and power in
each glance you gave; when plied by close questions, you found ready
and round answers. Very soon you seemed to get used to me: I believe
you felt the existence of sympathy between you and your grim and cross
master, Jane; for it was astonishing to see how quickly a certain
pleasant ease tranquillised your manner: snarl as I would, you showed
no surprise, fear, annoyance, or displeasure at my moroseness; you
watched me, and now and then smiled at me with a simple yet sagacious
grace I cannot describe. I was at once content and stimulated with what
I saw: I liked what I had seen, and wished to see more. Yet, for a long
time, I treated you distantly, and sought your company rarely. I was an
intellectual epicure, and wished to prolong the gratification of making
this novel and piquant acquaintance: besides, I was for a while
troubled with a haunting fear that if I handled the flower freely its
bloom would fade—the sweet charm of freshness would leave it. I did not
then know that it was no transitory blossom, but rather the radiant
resemblance of one, cut in an indestructible gem. Moreover, I wished to
see whether you would seek me if I shunned you—but you did not; you
kept in the schoolroom as still as your own desk and easel; if by
chance I met you, you passed me as soon, and with as little token of
recognition, as was consistent with respect. Your habitual expression
in those days, Jane, was a thoughtful look; not despondent, for you
were not sickly; but not buoyant, for you had little hope, and no
actual pleasure. I wondered what you thought of me, or if you ever
thought of me, and resolved to find this out.

“I resumed my notice of you. There was something glad in your glance,
and genial in your manner, when you conversed: I saw you had a social
heart; it was the silent schoolroom—it was the tedium of your life—that
made you mournful. I permitted myself the delight of being kind to you;
kindness stirred emotion soon: your face became soft in expression,
your tones gentle; I liked my name pronounced by your lips in a
grateful happy accent. I used to enjoy a chance meeting with you, Jane,
at this time: there was a curious hesitation in your manner: you
glanced at me with a slight trouble—a hovering doubt: you did not know
what my caprice might be—whether I was going to play the master and be
stern, or the friend and be benignant. I was now too fond of you often
to simulate the first whim; and, when I stretched my hand out
cordially, such bloom and light and bliss rose to your young, wistful
features, I had much ado often to avoid straining you then and there to
my heart.”

“Don’t talk any more of those days, sir,” I interrupted, furtively
dashing away some tears from my eyes; his language was torture to me;
for I knew what I must do—and do soon—and all these reminiscences, and
these revelations of his feelings only made my work more difficult.

“No, Jane,” he returned: “what necessity is there to dwell on the Past,
when the Present is so much surer—the Future so much brighter?”

I shuddered to hear the infatuated assertion.

“You see now how the case stands—do you not?” he continued. “After a
youth and manhood passed half in unutterable misery and half in dreary
solitude, I have for the first time found what I can truly love—I have
found _you_. You are my sympathy—my better self—my good angel. I am
bound to you with a strong attachment. I think you good, gifted,
lovely: a fervent, a solemn passion is conceived in my heart; it leans
to you, draws you to my centre and spring of life, wraps my existence
about you, and, kindling in pure, powerful flame, fuses you and me in
one.

“It was because I felt and knew this, that I resolved to marry you. To
tell me that I had already a wife is empty mockery: you know now that I
had but a hideous demon. I was wrong to attempt to deceive you; but I
feared a stubbornness that exists in your character. I feared early
instilled prejudice: I wanted to have you safe before hazarding
confidences. This was cowardly: I should have appealed to your
nobleness and magnanimity at first, as I do now—opened to you plainly
my life of agony—described to you my hunger and thirst after a higher
and worthier existence—shown to you, not my _resolution_ (that word is
weak), but my resistless _bent_ to love faithfully and well, where I am
faithfully and well loved in return. Then I should have asked you to
accept my pledge of fidelity and to give me yours. Jane—give it me
now.”

A pause.

“Why are you silent, Jane?”

I was experiencing an ordeal: a hand of fiery iron grasped my vitals.
Terrible moment: full of struggle, blackness, burning! Not a human
being that ever lived could wish to be loved better than I was loved;
and him who thus loved me I absolutely worshipped: and I must renounce
love and idol. One drear word comprised my intolerable duty—“Depart!”

“Jane, you understand what I want of you? Just this promise—‘I will be
yours, Mr. Rochester.’”

“Mr. Rochester, I will _not_ be yours.”

Another long silence.

“Jane!” recommenced he, with a gentleness that broke me down with
grief, and turned me stone-cold with ominous terror—for this still
voice was the pant of a lion rising—“Jane, do you mean to go one way in
the world, and to let me go another?”

“I do.”

“Jane” (bending towards and embracing me), “do you mean it now?”

“I do.”

“And now?” softly kissing my forehead and cheek.

“I do,” extricating myself from restraint rapidly and completely.

“Oh, Jane, this is bitter! This—this is wicked. It would not be wicked
to love me.”

“It would to obey you.”

A wild look raised his brows—crossed his features: he rose; but he
forebore yet. I laid my hand on the back of a chair for support: I
shook, I feared—but I resolved.

“One instant, Jane. Give one glance to my horrible life when you are
gone. All happiness will be torn away with you. What then is left? For
a wife I have but the maniac upstairs: as well might you refer me to
some corpse in yonder churchyard. What shall I do, Jane? Where turn for
a companion and for some hope?”

“Do as I do: trust in God and yourself. Believe in heaven. Hope to meet
again there.”

“Then you will not yield?”

“No.”

“Then you condemn me to live wretched and to die accursed?” His voice
rose.

“I advise you to live sinless, and I wish you to die tranquil.”

“Then you snatch love and innocence from me? You fling me back on lust
for a passion—vice for an occupation?”

“Mr. Rochester, I no more assign this fate to you than I grasp at it
for myself. We were born to strive and endure—you as well as I: do so.
You will forget me before I forget you.”

“You make me a liar by such language: you sully my honour. I declared I
could not change: you tell me to my face I shall change soon. And what
a distortion in your judgment, what a perversity in your ideas, is
proved by your conduct! Is it better to drive a fellow-creature to
despair than to transgress a mere human law, no man being injured by
the breach? for you have neither relatives nor acquaintances whom you
need fear to offend by living with me?”

This was true: and while he spoke my very conscience and reason turned
traitors against me, and charged me with crime in resisting him. They
spoke almost as loud as Feeling: and that clamoured wildly. “Oh,
comply!” it said. “Think of his misery; think of his danger—look at his
state when left alone; remember his headlong nature; consider the
recklessness following on despair—soothe him; save him; love him; tell
him you love him and will be his. Who in the world cares for _you_? or
who will be injured by what you do?”

Still indomitable was the reply—“_I_ care for myself. The more
solitary, the more friendless, the more unsustained I am, the more I
will respect myself. I will keep the law given by God; sanctioned by
man. I will hold to the principles received by me when I was sane, and
not mad—as I am now. Laws and principles are not for the times when
there is no temptation: they are for such moments as this, when body
and soul rise in mutiny against their rigour; stringent are they;
inviolate they shall be. If at my individual convenience I might break
them, what would be their worth? They have a worth—so I have always
believed; and if I cannot believe it now, it is because I am
insane—quite insane: with my veins running fire, and my heart beating
faster than I can count its throbs. Preconceived opinions, foregone
determinations, are all I have at this hour to stand by: there I plant
my foot.”

I did. Mr. Rochester, reading my countenance, saw I had done so. His
fury was wrought to the highest: he must yield to it for a moment,
whatever followed; he crossed the floor and seized my arm and grasped
my waist. He seemed to devour me with his flaming glance: physically, I
felt, at the moment, powerless as stubble exposed to the draught and
glow of a furnace: mentally, I still possessed my soul, and with it the
certainty of ultimate safety. The soul, fortunately, has an
interpreter—often an unconscious, but still a truthful interpreter—in
the eye. My eye rose to his; and while I looked in his fierce face I
gave an involuntary sigh; his gripe was painful, and my over-taxed
strength almost exhausted.

“Never,” said he, as he ground his teeth, “never was anything at once
so frail and so indomitable. A mere reed she feels in my hand!” (And he
shook me with the force of his hold.) “I could bend her with my finger
and thumb: and what good would it do if I bent, if I uptore, if I
crushed her? Consider that eye: consider the resolute, wild, free thing
looking out of it, defying me, with more than courage—with a stern
triumph. Whatever I do with its cage, I cannot get at it—the savage,
beautiful creature! If I tear, if I rend the slight prison, my outrage
will only let the captive loose. Conqueror I might be of the house; but
the inmate would escape to heaven before I could call myself possessor
of its clay dwelling-place. And it is you, spirit—with will and energy,
and virtue and purity—that I want: not alone your brittle frame. Of
yourself you could come with soft flight and nestle against my heart,
if you would: seized against your will, you will elude the grasp like
an essence—you will vanish ere I inhale your fragrance. Oh! come, Jane,
come!”

As he said this, he released me from his clutch, and only looked at me.
The look was far worse to resist than the frantic strain: only an
idiot, however, would have succumbed now. I had dared and baffled his
fury; I must elude his sorrow: I retired to the door.

“You are going, Jane?”

“I am going, sir.”

“You are leaving me?”

“Yes.”

“You will not come? You will not be my comforter, my rescuer? My deep
love, my wild woe, my frantic prayer, are all nothing to you?”

What unutterable pathos was in his voice! How hard it was to reiterate
firmly, “I am going.”

“Jane!”

“Mr. Rochester!”

“Withdraw, then,—I consent; but remember, you leave me here in anguish.
Go up to your own room; think over all I have said, and, Jane, cast a
glance on my sufferings—think of me.”

He turned away; he threw himself on his face on the sofa. “Oh, Jane! my
hope—my love—my life!” broke in anguish from his lips. Then came a
deep, strong sob.

I had already gained the door; but, reader, I walked back—walked back
as determinedly as I had retreated. I knelt down by him; I turned his
face from the cushion to me; I kissed his cheek; I smoothed his hair
with my hand.

“God bless you, my dear master!” I said. “God keep you from harm and
wrong—direct you, solace you—reward you well for your past kindness to
me.”

“Little Jane’s love would have been my best reward,” he answered;
“without it, my heart is broken. But Jane will give me her love:
yes—nobly, generously.”

Up the blood rushed to his face; forth flashed the fire from his eyes;
erect he sprang; he held his arms out; but I evaded the embrace, and at
once quitted the room.

“Farewell!” was the cry of my heart as I left him. Despair added,
“Farewell for ever!”


That night I never thought to sleep; but a slumber fell on me as soon
as I lay down in bed. I was transported in thought to the scenes of
childhood: I dreamt I lay in the red-room at Gateshead; that the night
was dark, and my mind impressed with strange fears. The light that long
ago had struck me into syncope, recalled in this vision, seemed
glidingly to mount the wall, and tremblingly to pause in the centre of
the obscured ceiling. I lifted up my head to look: the roof resolved to
clouds, high and dim; the gleam was such as the moon imparts to vapours
she is about to sever. I watched her come—watched with the strangest
anticipation; as though some word of doom were to be written on her
disk. She broke forth as never moon yet burst from cloud: a hand first
penetrated the sable folds and waved them away; then, not a moon, but a
white human form shone in the azure, inclining a glorious brow
earthward. It gazed and gazed on me. It spoke to my spirit:
immeasurably distant was the tone, yet so near, it whispered in my
heart—

“My daughter, flee temptation.”

“Mother, I will.”

So I answered after I had waked from the trance-like dream. It was yet
night, but July nights are short: soon after midnight, dawn comes. “It
cannot be too early to commence the task I have to fulfil,” thought I.
I rose: I was dressed; for I had taken off nothing but my shoes. I knew
where to find in my drawers some linen, a locket, a ring. In seeking
these articles, I encountered the beads of a pearl necklace Mr.
Rochester had forced me to accept a few days ago. I left that; it was
not mine: it was the visionary bride’s who had melted in air. The other
articles I made up in a parcel; my purse, containing twenty shillings
(it was all I had), I put in my pocket: I tied on my straw bonnet,
pinned my shawl, took the parcel and my slippers, which I would not put
on yet, and stole from my room.

“Farewell, kind Mrs. Fairfax!” I whispered, as I glided past her door.
“Farewell, my darling Adèle!” I said, as I glanced towards the nursery.
No thought could be admitted of entering to embrace her. I had to
deceive a fine ear: for aught I knew it might now be listening.

I would have got past Mr. Rochester’s chamber without a pause; but my
heart momentarily stopping its beat at that threshold, my foot was
forced to stop also. No sleep was there: the inmate was walking
restlessly from wall to wall; and again and again he sighed while I
listened. There was a heaven—a temporary heaven—in this room for me, if
I chose: I had but to go in and to say—

“Mr. Rochester, I will love you and live with you through life till
death,” and a fount of rapture would spring to my lips. I thought of
this.

That kind master, who could not sleep now, was waiting with impatience
for day. He would send for me in the morning; I should be gone. He
would have me sought for: vainly. He would feel himself forsaken; his
love rejected: he would suffer; perhaps grow desperate. I thought of
this too. My hand moved towards the lock: I caught it back, and glided
on.

Drearily I wound my way downstairs: I knew what I had to do, and I did
it mechanically. I sought the key of the side-door in the kitchen; I
sought, too, a phial of oil and a feather; I oiled the key and the
lock. I got some water, I got some bread: for perhaps I should have to
walk far; and my strength, sorely shaken of late, must not break down.
All this I did without one sound. I opened the door, passed out, shut
it softly. Dim dawn glimmered in the yard. The great gates were closed
and locked; but a wicket in one of them was only latched. Through that
I departed: it, too, I shut; and now I was out of Thornfield.

A mile off, beyond the fields, lay a road which stretched in the
contrary direction to Millcote; a road I had never travelled, but often
noticed, and wondered where it led: thither I bent my steps. No
reflection was to be allowed now: not one glance was to be cast back;
not even one forward. Not one thought was to be given either to the
past or the future. The first was a page so heavenly sweet—so deadly
sad—that to read one line of it would dissolve my courage and break
down my energy. The last was an awful blank: something like the world
when the deluge was gone by.

I skirted fields, and hedges, and lanes till after sunrise. I believe
it was a lovely summer morning: I know my shoes, which I had put on
when I left the house, were soon wet with dew. But I looked neither to
rising sun, nor smiling sky, nor wakening nature. He who is taken out
to pass through a fair scene to the scaffold, thinks not of the flowers
that smile on his road, but of the block and axe-edge; of the
disseverment of bone and vein; of the grave gaping at the end: and I
thought of drear flight and homeless wandering—and oh! with agony I
thought of what I left. I could not help it. I thought of him now—in
his room—watching the sunrise; hoping I should soon come to say I would
stay with him and be his. I longed to be his; I panted to return: it
was not too late; I could yet spare him the bitter pang of bereavement.
As yet my flight, I was sure, was undiscovered. I could go back and be
his comforter—his pride; his redeemer from misery, perhaps from ruin.
Oh, that fear of his self-abandonment—far worse than my abandonment—how
it goaded me! It was a barbed arrow-head in my breast; it tore me when
I tried to extract it; it sickened me when remembrance thrust it
farther in. Birds began singing in brake and copse: birds were faithful
to their mates; birds were emblems of love. What was I? In the midst of
my pain of heart and frantic effort of principle, I abhorred myself. I
had no solace from self-approbation: none even from self-respect. I had
injured—wounded—left my master. I was hateful in my own eyes. Still I
could not turn, nor retrace one step. God must have led me on. As to my
own will or conscience, impassioned grief had trampled one and stifled
the other. I was weeping wildly as I walked along my solitary way:
fast, fast I went like one delirious. A weakness, beginning inwardly,
extending to the limbs, seized me, and I fell: I lay on the ground some
minutes, pressing my face to the wet turf. I had some fear—or hope—that
here I should die: but I was soon up; crawling forwards on my hands and
knees, and then again raised to my feet—as eager and as determined as
ever to reach the road.

When I got there, I was forced to sit to rest me under the hedge; and
while I sat, I heard wheels, and saw a coach come on. I stood up and
lifted my hand; it stopped. I asked where it was going: the driver
named a place a long way off, and where I was sure Mr. Rochester had no
connections. I asked for what sum he would take me there; he said
thirty shillings; I answered I had but twenty; well, he would try to
make it do. He further gave me leave to get into the inside, as the
vehicle was empty: I entered, was shut in, and it rolled on its way.

Gentle reader, may you never feel what I then felt! May your eyes never
shed such stormy, scalding, heart-wrung tears as poured from mine. May
you never appeal to Heaven in prayers so hopeless and so agonised as in
that hour left my lips; for never may you, like me, dread to be the
instrument of evil to what you wholly love.




CHAPTER XXVIII


Two days are passed. It is a summer evening; the coachman has set me
down at a place called Whitcross; he could take me no farther for the
sum I had given, and I was not possessed of another shilling in the
world. The coach is a mile off by this time; I am alone. At this moment
I discover that I forgot to take my parcel out of the pocket of the
coach, where I had placed it for safety; there it remains, there it
must remain; and now, I am absolutely destitute.

Whitcross is no town, nor even a hamlet; it is but a stone pillar set
up where four roads meet: whitewashed, I suppose, to be more obvious at
a distance and in darkness. Four arms spring from its summit: the
nearest town to which these point is, according to the inscription,
distant ten miles; the farthest, above twenty. From the well-known
names of these towns I learn in what county I have lighted; a
north-midland shire, dusk with moorland, ridged with mountain: this I
see. There are great moors behind and on each hand of me; there are
waves of mountains far beyond that deep valley at my feet. The
population here must be thin, and I see no passengers on these roads:
they stretch out east, west, north, and south—white, broad, lonely;
they are all cut in the moor, and the heather grows deep and wild to
their very verge. Yet a chance traveller might pass by; and I wish no
eye to see me now: strangers would wonder what I am doing, lingering
here at the sign-post, evidently objectless and lost. I might be
questioned: I could give no answer but what would sound incredible and
excite suspicion. Not a tie holds me to human society at this
moment—not a charm or hope calls me where my fellow-creatures are—none
that saw me would have a kind thought or a good wish for me. I have no
relative but the universal mother, Nature: I will seek her breast and
ask repose.

I struck straight into the heath; I held on to a hollow I saw deeply
furrowing the brown moorside; I waded knee-deep in its dark growth; I
turned with its turnings, and finding a moss-blackened granite crag in
a hidden angle, I sat down under it. High banks of moor were about me;
the crag protected my head: the sky was over that.

Some time passed before I felt tranquil even here: I had a vague dread
that wild cattle might be near, or that some sportsman or poacher might
discover me. If a gust of wind swept the waste, I looked up, fearing it
was the rush of a bull; if a plover whistled, I imagined it a man.
Finding my apprehensions unfounded, however, and calmed by the deep
silence that reigned as evening declined at nightfall, I took
confidence. As yet I had not thought; I had only listened, watched,
dreaded; now I regained the faculty of reflection.

What was I to do? Where to go? Oh, intolerable questions, when I could
do nothing and go nowhere!—when a long way must yet be measured by my
weary, trembling limbs before I could reach human habitation—when cold
charity must be entreated before I could get a lodging: reluctant
sympathy importuned, almost certain repulse incurred, before my tale
could be listened to, or one of my wants relieved!

I touched the heath: it was dry, and yet warm with the heat of the
summer day. I looked at the sky; it was pure: a kindly star twinkled
just above the chasm ridge. The dew fell, but with propitious softness;
no breeze whispered. Nature seemed to me benign and good; I thought she
loved me, outcast as I was; and I, who from man could anticipate only
mistrust, rejection, insult, clung to her with filial fondness.
To-night, at least, I would be her guest, as I was her child: my mother
would lodge me without money and without price. I had one morsel of
bread yet: the remnant of a roll I had bought in a town we passed
through at noon with a stray penny—my last coin. I saw ripe bilberries
gleaming here and there, like jet beads in the heath: I gathered a
handful and ate them with the bread. My hunger, sharp before, was, if
not satisfied, appeased by this hermit’s meal. I said my evening
prayers at its conclusion, and then chose my couch.


I said my evening prayers

Beside the crag the heath was very deep: when I lay down my feet were
buried in it; rising high on each side, it left only a narrow space for
the night-air to invade. I folded my shawl double, and spread it over
me for a coverlet; a low, mossy swell was my pillow. Thus lodged, I was
not, at least at the commencement of the night, cold.

My rest might have been blissful enough, only a sad heart broke it. It
plained of its gaping wounds, its inward bleeding, its riven chords. It
trembled for Mr. Rochester and his doom; it bemoaned him with bitter
pity; it demanded him with ceaseless longing; and, impotent as a bird
with both wings broken, it still quivered its shattered pinions in vain
attempts to seek him.

Worn out with this torture of thought, I rose to my knees. Night was
come, and her planets were risen: a safe, still night: too serene for
the companionship of fear. We know that God is everywhere; but
certainly we feel His presence most when His works are on the grandest
scale spread before us; and it is in the unclouded night-sky, where His
worlds wheel their silent course, that we read clearest His infinitude,
His omnipotence, His omnipresence. I had risen to my knees to pray for
Mr. Rochester. Looking up, I, with tear-dimmed eyes, saw the mighty
Milky-way. Remembering what it was—what countless systems there swept
space like a soft trace of light—I felt the might and strength of God.
Sure was I of His efficiency to save what He had made: convinced I grew
that neither earth should perish, nor one of the souls it treasured. I
turned my prayer to thanksgiving: the Source of Life was also the
Saviour of spirits. Mr. Rochester was safe: he was God’s, and by God
would he be guarded. I again nestled to the breast of the hill; and ere
long in sleep forgot sorrow.

But next day, Want came to me pale and bare. Long after the little
birds had left their nests; long after bees had come in the sweet prime
of day to gather the heath honey before the dew was dried—when the long
morning shadows were curtailed, and the sun filled earth and sky—I got
up, and I looked round me.

What a still, hot, perfect day! What a golden desert this spreading
moor! Everywhere sunshine. I wished I could live in it and on it. I saw
a lizard run over the crag; I saw a bee busy among the sweet
bilberries. I would fain at the moment have become bee or lizard, that
I might have found fitting nutriment, permanent shelter here. But I was
a human being, and had a human being’s wants: I must not linger where
there was nothing to supply them. I rose; I looked back at the bed I
had left. Hopeless of the future, I wished but this—that my Maker had
that night thought good to require my soul of me while I slept; and
that this weary frame, absolved by death from further conflict with
fate, had now but to decay quietly, and mingle in peace with the soil
of this wilderness. Life, however, was yet in my possession, with all
its requirements, and pains, and responsibilities. The burden must be
carried; the want provided for; the suffering endured; the
responsibility fulfilled. I set out.

Whitcross regained, I followed a road which led from the sun, now
fervent and high. By no other circumstance had I will to decide my
choice. I walked a long time, and when I thought I had nearly done
enough, and might conscientiously yield to the fatigue that almost
overpowered me—might relax this forced action, and, sitting down on a
stone I saw near, submit resistlessly to the apathy that clogged heart
and limb—I heard a bell chime—a church bell.

I turned in the direction of the sound, and there, amongst the romantic
hills, whose changes and aspect I had ceased to note an hour ago, I saw
a hamlet and a spire. All the valley at my right hand was full of
pasture-fields, and cornfields, and wood; and a glittering stream ran
zig-zag through the varied shades of green, the mellowing grain, the
sombre woodland, the clear and sunny lea. Recalled by the rumbling of
wheels to the road before me, I saw a heavily-laden waggon labouring up
the hill, and not far beyond were two cows and their drover. Human life
and human labour were near. I must struggle on: strive to live and bend
to toil like the rest.

About two o’clock P.M. I entered the village. At the bottom of its one
street there was a little shop with some cakes of bread in the window.
I coveted a cake of bread. With that refreshment I could perhaps regain
a degree of energy: without it, it would be difficult to proceed. The
wish to have some strength and some vigour returned to me as soon as I
was amongst my fellow-beings. I felt it would be degrading to faint
with hunger on the causeway of a hamlet. Had I nothing about me I could
offer in exchange for one of these rolls? I considered. I had a small
silk handkerchief tied round my throat; I had my gloves. I could hardly
tell how men and women in extremities of destitution proceeded. I did
not know whether either of these articles would be accepted: probably
they would not; but I must try.

I entered the shop: a woman was there. Seeing a respectably-dressed
person, a lady as she supposed, she came forward with civility. How
could she serve me? I was seized with shame: my tongue would not utter
the request I had prepared. I dared not offer her the half-worn gloves,
the creased handkerchief: besides, I felt it would be absurd. I only
begged permission to sit down a moment, as I was tired. Disappointed in
the expectation of a customer, she coolly acceded to my request. She
pointed to a seat; I sank into it. I felt sorely urged to weep; but
conscious how unseasonable such a manifestation would be, I restrained
it. Soon I asked her “if there were any dressmaker or plain-workwoman
in the village?”

“Yes; two or three. Quite as many as there was employment for.”

I reflected. I was driven to the point now. I was brought face to face
with Necessity. I stood in the position of one without a resource,
without a friend, without a coin. I must do something. What? I must
apply somewhere. Where?

“Did she know of any place in the neighbourhood where a servant was
wanted?”

“Nay; she couldn’t say.”

“What was the chief trade in this place? What did most of the people
do?”

“Some were farm labourers; a good deal worked at Mr. Oliver’s
needle-factory, and at the foundry.”

“Did Mr. Oliver employ women?”

“Nay; it was men’s work.”

“And what do the women do?”

“I knawn’t,” was the answer. “Some does one thing, and some another.
Poor folk mun get on as they can.”

She seemed to be tired of my questions: and, indeed, what claim had I
to importune her? A neighbour or two came in; my chair was evidently
wanted. I took leave.

I passed up the street, looking as I went at all the houses to the
right hand and to the left; but I could discover no pretext, nor see an
inducement to enter any. I rambled round the hamlet, going sometimes to
a little distance and returning again, for an hour or more. Much
exhausted, and suffering greatly now for want of food, I turned aside
into a lane and sat down under the hedge. Ere many minutes had elapsed,
I was again on my feet, however, and again searching something—a
resource, or at least an informant. A pretty little house stood at the
top of the lane, with a garden before it, exquisitely neat and
brilliantly blooming. I stopped at it. What business had I to approach
the white door or touch the glittering knocker? In what way could it
possibly be the interest of the inhabitants of that dwelling to serve
me? Yet I drew near and knocked. A mild-looking, cleanly-attired young
woman opened the door. In such a voice as might be expected from a
hopeless heart and fainting frame—a voice wretchedly low and
faltering—I asked if a servant was wanted here?

“No,” said she; “we do not keep a servant.”

“Can you tell me where I could get employment of any kind?” I
continued. “I am a stranger, without acquaintance in this place. I want
some work: no matter what.”

But it was not her business to think for me, or to seek a place for me:
besides, in her eyes, how doubtful must have appeared my character,
position, tale. She shook her head, she “was sorry she could give me no
information,” and the white door closed, quite gently and civilly: but
it shut me out. If she had held it open a little longer, I believe I
should have begged a piece of bread; for I was now brought low.

I could not bear to return to the sordid village, where, besides, no
prospect of aid was visible. I should have longed rather to deviate to
a wood I saw not far off, which appeared in its thick shade to offer
inviting shelter; but I was so sick, so weak, so gnawed with nature’s
cravings, instinct kept me roaming round abodes where there was a
chance of food. Solitude would be no solitude—rest no rest—while the
vulture, hunger, thus sank beak and talons in my side.

I drew near houses; I left them, and came back again, and again I
wandered away: always repelled by the consciousness of having no claim
to ask—no right to expect interest in my isolated lot. Meantime, the
afternoon advanced, while I thus wandered about like a lost and
starving dog. In crossing a field, I saw the church spire before me: I
hastened towards it. Near the churchyard, and in the middle of a
garden, stood a well-built though small house, which I had no doubt was
the parsonage. I remembered that strangers who arrive at a place where
they have no friends, and who want employment, sometimes apply to the
clergyman for introduction and aid. It is the clergyman’s function to
help—at least with advice—those who wished to help themselves. I seemed
to have something like a right to seek counsel here. Renewing then my
courage, and gathering my feeble remains of strength, I pushed on. I
reached the house, and knocked at the kitchen-door. An old woman
opened: I asked was this the parsonage?

“Yes.”

“Was the clergyman in?”

“No.”

“Would he be in soon?”

“No, he was gone from home.”

“To a distance?”

“Not so far—happen three mile. He had been called away by the sudden
death of his father: he was at Marsh End now, and would very likely
stay there a fortnight longer.”

“Was there any lady of the house?”

“Nay, there was naught but her, and she was housekeeper;” and of her,
reader, I could not bear to ask the relief for want of which I was
sinking; I could not yet beg; and again I crawled away.

Once more I took off my handkerchief—once more I thought of the cakes
of bread in the little shop. Oh, for but a crust! for but one mouthful
to allay the pang of famine! Instinctively I turned my face again to
the village; I found the shop again, and I went in; and though others
were there besides the woman I ventured the request—“Would she give me
a roll for this handkerchief?”

She looked at me with evident suspicion: “Nay, she never sold stuff i’
that way.”

Almost desperate, I asked for half a cake; she again refused. “How
could she tell where I had got the handkerchief?” she said.

“Would she take my gloves?”

“No! what could she do with them?”

Reader, it is not pleasant to dwell on these details. Some say there is
enjoyment in looking back to painful experience past; but at this day I
can scarcely bear to review the times to which I allude: the moral
degradation, blent with the physical suffering, form too distressing a
recollection ever to be willingly dwelt on. I blamed none of those who
repulsed me. I felt it was what was to be expected, and what could not
be helped: an ordinary beggar is frequently an object of suspicion; a
well-dressed beggar inevitably so. To be sure, what I begged was
employment; but whose business was it to provide me with employment?
Not, certainly, that of persons who saw me then for the first time, and
who knew nothing about my character. And as to the woman who would not
take my handkerchief in exchange for her bread, why, she was right, if
the offer appeared to her sinister or the exchange unprofitable. Let me
condense now. I am sick of the subject.

A little before dark I passed a farm-house, at the open door of which
the farmer was sitting, eating his supper of bread and cheese. I
stopped and said—

“Will you give me a piece of bread? for I am very hungry.” He cast on
me a glance of surprise; but without answering, he cut a thick slice
from his loaf, and gave it to me. I imagine he did not think I was a
beggar, but only an eccentric sort of lady, who had taken a fancy to
his brown loaf. As soon as I was out of sight of his house, I sat down
and ate it.

I could not hope to get a lodging under a roof, and sought it in the
wood I have before alluded to. But my night was wretched, my rest
broken: the ground was damp, the air cold: besides, intruders passed
near me more than once, and I had again and again to change my
quarters: no sense of safety or tranquillity befriended me. Towards
morning it rained; the whole of the following day was wet. Do not ask
me, reader, to give a minute account of that day; as before, I sought
work; as before, I was repulsed; as before, I starved; but once did
food pass my lips. At the door of a cottage I saw a little girl about
to throw a mess of cold porridge into a pig trough. “Will you give me
that?” I asked.


“Will you give me that?” I asked

She stared at me. “Mother!” she exclaimed, “there is a woman wants me
to give her these porridge.”

“Well lass,” replied a voice within, “give it her if she’s a beggar. T’
pig doesn’t want it.”

The girl emptied the stiffened mould into my hand, and I devoured it
ravenously.

As the wet twilight deepened, I stopped in a solitary bridle-path,
which I had been pursuing an hour or more.

“My strength is quite failing me,” I said in a soliloquy. “I feel I
cannot go much farther. Shall I be an outcast again this night? While
the rain descends so, must I lay my head on the cold, drenched ground?
I fear I cannot do otherwise: for who will receive me? But it will be
very dreadful, with this feeling of hunger, faintness, chill, and this
sense of desolation—this total prostration of hope. In all likelihood,
though, I should die before morning. And why cannot I reconcile myself
to the prospect of death? Why do I struggle to retain a valueless life?
Because I know, or believe, Mr. Rochester is living: and then, to die
of want and cold is a fate to which nature cannot submit passively. Oh,
Providence! sustain me a little longer! Aid!—direct me!”

My glazed eye wandered over the dim and misty landscape. I saw I had
strayed far from the village: it was quite out of sight. The very
cultivation surrounding it had disappeared. I had, by cross-ways and
by-paths, once more drawn near the tract of moorland; and now, only a
few fields, almost as wild and unproductive as the heath from which
they were scarcely reclaimed, lay between me and the dusky hill.

“Well, I would rather die yonder than in a street or on a frequented
road,” I reflected. “And far better that crows and ravens—if any ravens
there be in these regions—should pick my flesh from my bones, than that
they should be prisoned in a workhouse coffin and moulder in a pauper’s
grave.”

To the hill, then, I turned. I reached it. It remained now only to find
a hollow where I could lie down, and feel at least hidden, if not
secure. But all the surface of the waste looked level. It showed no
variation but of tint: green, where rush and moss overgrew the marshes;
black, where the dry soil bore only heath. Dark as it was getting, I
could still see these changes, though but as mere alternations of light
and shade; for colour had faded with the daylight.

My eye still roved over the sullen swell and along the moor-edge,
vanishing amidst the wildest scenery, when at one dim point, far in
among the marshes and the ridges, a light sprang up. “That is an _ignis
fatuus_,” was my first thought; and I expected it would soon vanish. It
burnt on, however, quite steadily, neither receding nor advancing. “Is
it, then, a bonfire just kindled?” I questioned. I watched to see
whether it would spread: but no; as it did not diminish, so it did not
enlarge. “It may be a candle in a house,” I then conjectured; “but if
so, I can never reach it. It is much too far away: and were it within a
yard of me, what would it avail? I should but knock at the door to have
it shut in my face.”

And I sank down where I stood, and hid my face against the ground. I
lay still a while: the night-wind swept over the hill and over me, and
died moaning in the distance; the rain fell fast, wetting me afresh to
the skin. Could I but have stiffened to the still frost—the friendly
numbness of death—it might have pelted on; I should not have felt it;
but my yet living flesh shuddered at its chilling influence. I rose ere
long.

The light was yet there, shining dim but constant through the rain. I
tried to walk again: I dragged my exhausted limbs slowly towards it. It
led me aslant over the hill, through a wide bog, which would have been
impassable in winter, and was splashy and shaking even now, in the
height of summer. Here I fell twice; but as often I rose and rallied my
faculties. This light was my forlorn hope: I must gain it.

Having crossed the marsh, I saw a trace of white over the moor. I
approached it; it was a road or a track: it led straight up to the
light, which now beamed from a sort of knoll, amidst a clump of
trees—firs, apparently, from what I could distinguish of the character
of their forms and foliage through the gloom. My star vanished as I
drew near: some obstacle had intervened between me and it. I put out my
hand to feel the dark mass before me: I discriminated the rough stones
of a low wall—above it, something like palisades, and within, a high
and prickly hedge. I groped on. Again a whitish object gleamed before
me: it was a gate—a wicket; it moved on its hinges as I touched it. On
each side stood a sable bush—holly or yew.

Entering the gate and passing the shrubs, the silhouette of a house
rose to view, black, low, and rather long; but the guiding light shone
nowhere. All was obscurity. Were the inmates retired to rest? I feared
it must be so. In seeking the door, I turned an angle: there shot out
the friendly gleam again, from the lozenged panes of a very small
latticed window, within a foot of the ground, made still smaller by the
growth of ivy or some other creeping plant, whose leaves clustered
thick over the portion of the house wall in which it was set. The
aperture was so screened and narrow, that curtain or shutter had been
deemed unnecessary; and when I stooped down and put aside the spray of
foliage shooting over it, I could see all within. I could see clearly a
room with a sanded floor, clean scoured; a dresser of walnut, with
pewter plates ranged in rows, reflecting the redness and radiance of a
glowing peat-fire. I could see a clock, a white deal table, some
chairs. The candle, whose ray had been my beacon, burnt on the table;
and by its light an elderly woman, somewhat rough-looking, but
scrupulously clean, like all about her, was knitting a stocking.

I noticed these objects cursorily only—in them there was nothing
extraordinary. A group of more interest appeared near the hearth,
sitting still amidst the rosy peace and warmth suffusing it. Two young,
graceful women—ladies in every point—sat, one in a low rocking-chair,
the other on a lower stool; both wore deep mourning of crape and
bombazeen, which sombre garb singularly set off very fair necks and
faces: a large old pointer dog rested its massive head on the knee of
one girl—in the lap of the other was cushioned a black cat.

A strange place was this humble kitchen for such occupants! Who were
they? They could not be the daughters of the elderly person at the
table; for she looked like a rustic, and they were all delicacy and
cultivation. I had nowhere seen such faces as theirs: and yet, as I
gazed on them, I seemed intimate with every lineament. I cannot call
them handsome—they were too pale and grave for the word: as they each
bent over a book, they looked thoughtful almost to severity. A stand
between them supported a second candle and two great volumes, to which
they frequently referred, comparing them, seemingly, with the smaller
books they held in their hands, like people consulting a dictionary to
aid them in the task of translation. This scene was as silent as if all
the figures had been shadows and the firelit apartment a picture: so
hushed was it, I could hear the cinders fall from the grate, the clock
tick in its obscure corner; and I even fancied I could distinguish the
click-click of the woman’s knitting-needles. When, therefore, a voice
broke the strange stillness at last, it was audible enough to me.

“Listen, Diana,” said one of the absorbed students; “Franz and old
Daniel are together in the night-time, and Franz is telling a dream
from which he has awakened in terror—listen!” And in a low voice she
read something, of which not one word was intelligible to me; for it
was in an unknown tongue—neither French nor Latin. Whether it were
Greek or German I could not tell.

“That is strong,” she said, when she had finished: “I relish it.” The
other girl, who had lifted her head to listen to her sister, repeated,
while she gazed at the fire, a line of what had been read. At a later
day, I knew the language and the book; therefore, I will here quote the
line: though, when I first heard it, it was only like a stroke on
sounding brass to me—conveying no meaning:—

“‘Da trat hervor Einer, anzusehen wie die Sternen Nacht.’ Good! good!”
she exclaimed, while her dark and deep eye sparkled. “There you have a
dim and mighty archangel fitly set before you! The line is worth a
hundred pages of fustian. ‘Ich wäge die Gedanken in der Schale meines
Zornes und die Werke mit dem Gewichte meines Grimms.’ I like it!”

Both were again silent.

“Is there ony country where they talk i’ that way?” asked the old
woman, looking up from her knitting.

“Yes, Hannah—a far larger country than England, where they talk in no
other way.”

“Well, for sure case, I knawn’t how they can understand t’ one t’other:
and if either o’ ye went there, ye could tell what they said, I guess?”

“We could probably tell something of what they said, but not all—for we
are not as clever as you think us, Hannah. We don’t speak German, and
we cannot read it without a dictionary to help us.”

“And what good does it do you?”

“We mean to teach it some time—or at least the elements, as they say;
and then we shall get more money than we do now.”

“Varry like: but give ower studying; ye’ve done enough for to-night.”

“I think we have: at least I’m tired. Mary, are you?”

“Mortally: after all, it’s tough work fagging away at a language with
no master but a lexicon.”

“It is, especially such a language as this crabbed but glorious
Deutsch. I wonder when St. John will come home.”

“Surely he will not be long now: it is just ten (looking at a little
gold watch she drew from her girdle). It rains fast, Hannah: will you
have the goodness to look at the fire in the parlour?”

The woman rose: she opened a door, through which I dimly saw a passage:
soon I heard her stir a fire in an inner room; she presently came back.

“Ah, childer!” said she, “it fair troubles me to go into yond’ room
now: it looks so lonesome wi’ the chair empty and set back in a
corner.”

She wiped her eyes with her apron: the two girls, grave before, looked
sad now.

“But he is in a better place,” continued Hannah: “we shouldn’t wish him
here again. And then, nobody need to have a quieter death nor he had.”

“You say he never mentioned us?” inquired one of the ladies.

“He hadn’t time, bairn: he was gone in a minute, was your father. He
had been a bit ailing like the day before, but naught to signify; and
when Mr. St. John asked if he would like either o’ ye to be sent for,
he fair laughed at him. He began again with a bit of a heaviness in his
head the next day—that is, a fortnight sin’—and he went to sleep and
niver wakened: he wor a’most stark when your brother went into t’
chamber and fand him. Ah, childer! that’s t’ last o’ t’ old stock—for
ye and Mr. St. John is like of different soart to them ’at’s gone; for
all your mother wor mich i’ your way, and a’most as book-learned. She
wor the pictur’ o’ ye, Mary: Diana is more like your father.”

I thought them so similar I could not tell where the old servant (for
such I now concluded her to be) saw the difference. Both were fair
complexioned and slenderly made; both possessed faces full of
distinction and intelligence. One, to be sure, had hair a shade darker
than the other, and there was a difference in their style of wearing
it; Mary’s pale brown locks were parted and braided smooth: Diana’s
duskier tresses covered her neck with thick curls. The clock struck
ten.

“Ye’ll want your supper, I am sure,” observed Hannah; “and so will Mr.
St. John when he comes in.”

And she proceeded to prepare the meal. The ladies rose; they seemed
about to withdraw to the parlour. Till this moment, I had been so
intent on watching them, their appearance and conversation had excited
in me so keen an interest, I had half-forgotten my own wretched
position: now it recurred to me. More desolate, more desperate than
ever, it seemed from contrast. And how impossible did it appear to
touch the inmates of this house with concern on my behalf; to make them
believe in the truth of my wants and woes—to induce them to vouchsafe a
rest for my wanderings! As I groped out the door, and knocked at it
hesitatingly, I felt that last idea to be a mere chimera. Hannah
opened.

“What do you want?” she inquired, in a voice of surprise, as she
surveyed me by the light of the candle she held.

“May I speak to your mistresses?” I said.

“You had better tell me what you have to say to them. Where do you come
from?”

“I am a stranger.”

“What is your business here at this hour?”

“I want a night’s shelter in an out-house or anywhere, and a morsel of
bread to eat.”

Distrust, the very feeling I dreaded, appeared in Hannah’s face. “I’ll
give you a piece of bread,” she said, after a pause; “but we can’t take
in a vagrant to lodge. It isn’t likely.”

“Do let me speak to your mistresses.”

“No, not I. What can they do for you? You should not be roving about
now; it looks very ill.”

“But where shall I go if you drive me away? What shall I do?”

“Oh, I’ll warrant you know where to go and what to do. Mind you don’t
do wrong, that’s all. Here is a penny; now go—”

“A penny cannot feed me, and I have no strength to go farther. Don’t
shut the door:—oh, don’t, for God’s sake!”

“I must; the rain is driving in—”

“Tell the young ladies. Let me see them—”

“Indeed, I will not. You are not what you ought to be, or you wouldn’t
make such a noise. Move off.”

“But I must die if I am turned away.”

“Not you. I’m fear’d you have some ill plans agate, that bring you
about folk’s houses at this time o’ night. If you’ve any
followers—housebreakers or such like—anywhere near, you may tell them
we are not by ourselves in the house; we have a gentleman, and dogs,
and guns.” Here the honest but inflexible servant clapped the door to
and bolted it within.

This was the climax. A pang of exquisite suffering—a throe of true
despair—rent and heaved my heart. Worn out, indeed, I was; not another
step could I stir. I sank on the wet doorstep: I groaned—I wrung my
hands—I wept in utter anguish. Oh, this spectre of death! Oh, this last
hour, approaching in such horror! Alas, this isolation—this banishment
from my kind! Not only the anchor of hope, but the footing of fortitude
was gone—at least for a moment; but the last I soon endeavoured to
regain.

“I can but die,” I said, “and I believe in God. Let me try to wait His
will in silence.”

These words I not only thought, but uttered; and thrusting back all my
misery into my heart, I made an effort to compel it to remain
there—dumb and still.

“All men must die,” said a voice quite close at hand; “but all are not
condemned to meet a lingering and premature doom, such as yours would
be if you perished here of want.”

“Who or what speaks?” I asked, terrified at the unexpected sound, and
incapable now of deriving from any occurrence a hope of aid. A form was
near—what form, the pitch-dark night and my enfeebled vision prevented
me from distinguishing. With a loud long knock, the new-comer appealed
to the door.

“Is it you, Mr. St. John?” cried Hannah.

“Yes—yes; open quickly.”

“Well, how wet and cold you must be, such a wild night as it is! Come
in—your sisters are quite uneasy about you, and I believe there are bad
folks about. There has been a beggar-woman—I declare she is not gone
yet!—laid down there. Get up! for shame! Move off, I say!”

“Hush, Hannah! I have a word to say to the woman. You have done your
duty in excluding, now let me do mine in admitting her. I was near, and
listened to both you and her. I think this is a peculiar case—I must at
least examine into it. Young woman, rise, and pass before me into the
house.”


Hush, Hannah; I have a word to say to the woman

With difficulty I obeyed him. Presently I stood within that clean,
bright kitchen—on the very hearth—trembling, sickening; conscious of an
aspect in the last degree ghastly, wild, and weather-beaten. The two
ladies, their brother, Mr. St. John, the old servant, were all gazing
at me.

“St. John, who is it?” I heard one ask.

“I cannot tell: I found her at the door,” was the reply.

“She does look white,” said Hannah.

“As white as clay or death,” was responded. “She will fall: let her
sit.”

And indeed my head swam: I dropped, but a chair received me. I still
possessed my senses, though just now I could not speak.

“Perhaps a little water would restore her. Hannah, fetch some. But she
is worn to nothing. How very thin, and how very bloodless!”

“A mere spectre!”

“Is she ill, or only famished?”

“Famished, I think. Hannah, is that milk? Give it me, and a piece of
bread.”

Diana (I knew her by the long curls which I saw drooping between me and
the fire as she bent over me) broke some bread, dipped it in milk, and
put it to my lips. Her face was near mine: I saw there was pity in it,
and I felt sympathy in her hurried breathing. In her simple words, too,
the same balm-like emotion spoke: “Try to eat.”

“Yes—try,” repeated Mary gently; and Mary’s hand removed my sodden
bonnet and lifted my head. I tasted what they offered me: feebly at
first, eagerly soon.

“Not too much at first—restrain her,” said the brother; “she has had
enough.” And he withdrew the cup of milk and the plate of bread.

“A little more, St. John—look at the avidity in her eyes.”

“No more at present, sister. Try if she can speak now—ask her her
name.”

I felt I could speak, and I answered—“My name is Jane Elliott.” Anxious
as ever to avoid discovery, I had before resolved to assume an _alias_.

“And where do you live? Where are your friends?”

I was silent.

“Can we send for any one you know?”

I shook my head.

“What account can you give of yourself?”

Somehow, now that I had once crossed the threshold of this house, and
once was brought face to face with its owners, I felt no longer
outcast, vagrant, and disowned by the wide world. I dared to put off
the mendicant—to resume my natural manner and character. I began once
more to know myself; and when Mr. St. John demanded an account—which at
present I was far too weak to render—I said after a brief pause—

“Sir, I can give you no details to-night.”

“But what, then,” said he, “do you expect me to do for you?”

“Nothing,” I replied. My strength sufficed for but short answers. Diana
took the word—

“Do you mean,” she asked, “that we have now given you what aid you
require? and that we may dismiss you to the moor and the rainy night?”

I looked at her. She had, I thought, a remarkable countenance, instinct
both with power and goodness. I took sudden courage. Answering her
compassionate gaze with a smile, I said—“I will trust you. If I were a
masterless and stray dog, I know that you would not turn me from your
hearth to-night: as it is, I really have no fear. Do with me and for me
as you like; but excuse me from much discourse—my breath is short—I
feel a spasm when I speak.” All three surveyed me, and all three were
silent.

“Hannah,” said Mr. St. John, at last, “let her sit there at present,
and ask her no questions; in ten minutes more, give her the remainder
of that milk and bread. Mary and Diana, let us go into the parlour and
talk the matter over.”

They withdrew. Very soon one of the ladies returned—I could not tell
which. A kind of pleasant stupor was stealing over me as I sat by the
genial fire. In an undertone she gave some directions to Hannah. Ere
long, with the servant’s aid, I contrived to mount a staircase; my
dripping clothes were removed; soon a warm, dry bed received me. I
thanked God—experienced amidst unutterable exhaustion a glow of
grateful joy—and slept.




CHAPTER XXIX


The recollection of about three days and nights succeeding this is very
dim in my mind. I can recall some sensations felt in that interval; but
few thoughts framed, and no actions performed. I knew I was in a small
room and in a narrow bed. To that bed I seemed to have grown; I lay on
it motionless as a stone; and to have torn me from it would have been
almost to kill me. I took no note of the lapse of time—of the change
from morning to noon, from noon to evening. I observed when any one
entered or left the apartment: I could even tell who they were; I could
understand what was said when the speaker stood near to me; but I could
not answer; to open my lips or move my limbs was equally impossible.
Hannah, the servant, was my most frequent visitor. Her coming disturbed
me. I had a feeling that she wished me away: that she did not
understand me or my circumstances; that she was prejudiced against me.
Diana and Mary appeared in the chamber once or twice a day. They would
whisper sentences of this sort at my bedside—

“It is very well we took her in.”

“Yes; she would certainly have been found dead at the door in the
morning had she been left out all night. I wonder what she has gone
through?”

“Strange hardships, I imagine—poor, emaciated, pallid wanderer!”

“She is not an uneducated person, I should think, by her manner of
speaking; her accent was quite pure; and the clothes she took off,
though splashed and wet, were little worn and fine.”

“She has a peculiar face; fleshless and haggard as it is, I rather like
it; and when in good health and animated, I can fancy her physiognomy
would be agreeable.”

Never once in their dialogues did I hear a syllable of regret at the
hospitality they had extended to me, or of suspicion of, or aversion
to, myself. I was comforted.

Mr. St. John came but once: he looked at me, and said my state of
lethargy was the result of reaction from excessive and protracted
fatigue. He pronounced it needless to send for a doctor: nature, he was
sure, would manage best, left to herself. He said every nerve had been
overstrained in some way, and the whole system must sleep torpid a
while. There was no disease. He imagined my recovery would be rapid
enough when once commenced. These opinions he delivered in a few words,
in a quiet, low voice; and added, after a pause, in the tone of a man
little accustomed to expansive comment, “Rather an unusual physiognomy;
certainly, not indicative of vulgarity or degradation.”

“Far otherwise,” responded Diana. “To speak truth, St. John, my heart
rather warms to the poor little soul. I wish we may be able to benefit
her permanently.”

“That is hardly likely,” was the reply. “You will find she is some
young lady who has had a misunderstanding with her friends, and has
probably injudiciously left them. We may, perhaps, succeed in restoring
her to them, if she is not obstinate: but I trace lines of force in her
face which make me sceptical of her tractability.” He stood considering
me some minutes; then added, “She looks sensible, but not at all
handsome.”

“She is so ill, St. John.”

“Ill or well, she would always be plain. The grace and harmony of
beauty are quite wanting in those features.”

On the third day I was better; on the fourth, I could speak, move, rise
in bed, and turn. Hannah had brought me some gruel and dry toast,
about, as I supposed, the dinner-hour. I had eaten with relish: the
food was good—void of the feverish flavour which had hitherto poisoned
what I had swallowed. When she left me, I felt comparatively strong and
revived: ere long satiety of repose and desire for action stirred me. I
wished to rise; but what could I put on? Only my damp and bemired
apparel; in which I had slept on the ground and fallen in the marsh. I
felt ashamed to appear before my benefactors so clad. I was spared the
humiliation.

On a chair by the bedside were all my own things, clean and dry. My
black silk frock hung against the wall. The traces of the bog were
removed from it; the creases left by the wet smoothed out: it was quite
decent. My very shoes and stockings were purified and rendered
presentable. There were the means of washing in the room, and a comb
and brush to smooth my hair. After a weary process, and resting every
five minutes, I succeeded in dressing myself. My clothes hung loose on
me; for I was much wasted, but I covered deficiencies with a shawl, and
once more, clean and respectable looking—no speck of the dirt, no trace
of the disorder I so hated, and which seemed so to degrade me, left—I
crept down a stone staircase with the aid of the banisters, to a narrow
low passage, and found my way presently to the kitchen.

It was full of the fragrance of new bread and the warmth of a generous
fire. Hannah was baking. Prejudices, it is well known, are most
difficult to eradicate from the heart whose soil has never been
loosened or fertilised by education: they grow there, firm as weeds
among stones. Hannah had been cold and stiff, indeed, at the first:
latterly she had begun to relent a little; and when she saw me come in
tidy and well-dressed, she even smiled.

“What, you have got up!” she said. “You are better, then. You may sit
you down in my chair on the hearthstone, if you will.”

She pointed to the rocking-chair: I took it. She bustled about,
examining me every now and then with the corner of her eye. Turning to
me, as she took some loaves from the oven, she asked bluntly—

“Did you ever go a-begging afore you came here?”

I was indignant for a moment; but remembering that anger was out of the
question, and that I had indeed appeared as a beggar to her, I answered
quietly, but still not without a certain marked firmness—

“You are mistaken in supposing me a beggar. I am no beggar; any more
than yourself or your young ladies.”

After a pause she said, “I dunnut understand that: you’ve like no
house, nor no brass, I guess?”

“The want of house or brass (by which I suppose you mean money) does
not make a beggar in your sense of the word.”

“Are you book-learned?” she inquired presently.

“Yes, very.”

“But you’ve never been to a boarding-school?”

“I was at a boarding-school eight years.”

She opened her eyes wide. “Whatever cannot ye keep yourself for, then?”

“I have kept myself; and, I trust, shall keep myself again. What are
you going to do with these gooseberries?” I inquired, as she brought
out a basket of the fruit.

“Mak’ ’em into pies.”

“Give them to me and I’ll pick them.”

“Nay; I dunnut want ye to do nought.”

“But I must do something. Let me have them.”

She consented; and she even brought me a clean towel to spread over my
dress, “lest,” as she said, “I should mucky it.”

“Ye’ve not been used to sarvant’s wark, I see by your hands,” she
remarked. “Happen ye’ve been a dressmaker?”

“No, you are wrong. And now, never mind what I have been: don’t trouble
your head further about me; but tell me the name of the house where we
are.”

“Some calls it Marsh End, and some calls it Moor House.”

“And the gentleman who lives here is called Mr. St. John?”

“Nay; he doesn’t live here: he is only staying a while. When he is at
home, he is in his own parish at Morton.”

“That village a few miles off?

“Aye.”

“And what is he?”

“He is a parson.”

I remembered the answer of the old housekeeper at the parsonage, when I
had asked to see the clergyman. “This, then, was his father’s
residence?”

“Aye; old Mr. Rivers lived here, and his father, and grandfather, and
gurt (great) grandfather afore him.”

“The name, then, of that gentleman, is Mr. St. John Rivers?”

“Aye; St. John is like his kirstened name.”

“And his sisters are called Diana and Mary Rivers?”

“Yes.”

“Their father is dead?”

“Dead three weeks sin’ of a stroke.”

“They have no mother?”

“The mistress has been dead this mony a year.”

“Have you lived with the family long?”

“I’ve lived here thirty year. I nursed them all three.”

“That proves you must have been an honest and faithful servant. I will
say so much for you, though you have had the incivility to call me a
beggar.”

She again regarded me with a surprised stare. “I believe,” she said, “I
was quite mista’en in my thoughts of you: but there is so mony cheats
goes about, you mun forgie me.”

“And though,” I continued, rather severely, “you wished to turn me from
the door, on a night when you should not have shut out a dog.”

“Well, it was hard: but what can a body do? I thought more o’ th’
childer nor of mysel: poor things! They’ve like nobody to tak’ care on
’em but me. I’m like to look sharpish.”

I maintained a grave silence for some minutes.

“You munnut think too hardly of me,” she again remarked.

“But I do think hardly of you,” I said; “and I’ll tell you why—not so
much because you refused to give me shelter, or regarded me as an
impostor, as because you just now made it a species of reproach that I
had no ‘brass’ and no house. Some of the best people that ever lived
have been as destitute as I am; and if you are a Christian, you ought
not to consider poverty a crime.”

“No more I ought,” said she: “Mr. St. John tells me so too; and I see I
wor wrang—but I’ve clear a different notion on you now to what I had.
You look a raight down dacent little crater.”

“That will do—I forgive you now. Shake hands.”

She put her floury and horny hand into mine; another and heartier smile
illumined her rough face, and from that moment we were friends.

Hannah was evidently fond of talking. While I picked the fruit, and she
made the paste for the pies, she proceeded to give me sundry details
about her deceased master and mistress, and “the childer,” as she
called the young people.

Old Mr. Rivers, she said, was a plain man enough, but a gentleman, and
of as ancient a family as could be found. Marsh End had belonged to the
Rivers ever since it was a house: and it was, she affirmed, “aboon two
hundred year old—for all it looked but a small, humble place, naught to
compare wi’ Mr. Oliver’s grand hall down i’ Morton Vale. But she could
remember Bill Oliver’s father a journeyman needlemaker; and th’ Rivers
wor gentry i’ th’ owd days o’ th’ Henrys, as onybody might see by
looking into th’ registers i’ Morton Church vestry.” Still, she
allowed, “the owd maister was like other folk—naught mich out o’ t’
common way: stark mad o’ shooting, and farming, and sich like.” The
mistress was different. She was a great reader, and studied a deal; and
the “bairns” had taken after her. There was nothing like them in these
parts, nor ever had been; they had liked learning, all three, almost
from the time they could speak; and they had always been “of a mak’ of
their own.” Mr. St. John, when he grew up, would go to college and be a
parson; and the girls, as soon as they left school, would seek places
as governesses: for they had told her their father had some years ago
lost a great deal of money by a man he had trusted turning bankrupt;
and as he was now not rich enough to give them fortunes, they must
provide for themselves. They had lived very little at home for a long
while, and were only come now to stay a few weeks on account of their
father’s death; but they did so like Marsh End and Morton, and all
these moors and hills about. They had been in London, and many other
grand towns; but they always said there was no place like home; and
then they were so agreeable with each other—never fell out nor
“threaped.” She did not know where there was such a family for being
united.

Having finished my task of gooseberry picking, I asked where the two
ladies and their brother were now.

“Gone over to Morton for a walk; but they would be back in half-an-hour
to tea.”

They returned within the time Hannah had allotted them: they entered by
the kitchen door. Mr. St. John, when he saw me, merely bowed and passed
through; the two ladies stopped: Mary, in a few words, kindly and
calmly expressed the pleasure she felt in seeing me well enough to be
able to come down; Diana took my hand: she shook her head at me.

“You should have waited for my leave to descend,” she said. “You still
look very pale—and so thin! Poor child!—poor girl!”

Diana had a voice toned, to my ear, like the cooing of a dove. She
possessed eyes whose gaze I delighted to encounter. Her whole face
seemed to me full of charm. Mary’s countenance was equally
intelligent—her features equally pretty; but her expression was more
reserved, and her manners, though gentle, more distant. Diana looked
and spoke with a certain authority: she had a will, evidently. It was
my nature to feel pleasure in yielding to an authority supported like
hers, and to bend, where my conscience and self-respect permitted, to
an active will.

“And what business have you here?” she continued. “It is not your
place. Mary and I sit in the kitchen sometimes, because at home we like
to be free, even to license—but you are a visitor, and must go into the
parlour.”

“I am very well here.”

“Not at all, with Hannah bustling about and covering you with flour.”

“Besides, the fire is too hot for you,” interposed Mary.

“To be sure,” added her sister. “Come, you must be obedient.” And still
holding my hand she made me rise, and led me into the inner room.

“Sit there,” she said, placing me on the sofa, “while we take our
things off and get the tea ready; it is another privilege we exercise
in our little moorland home—to prepare our own meals when we are so
inclined, or when Hannah is baking, brewing, washing, or ironing.”

She closed the door, leaving me solus with Mr. St. John, who sat
opposite, a book or newspaper in his hand. I examined first, the
parlour, and then its occupant.

The parlour was rather a small room, very plainly furnished, yet
comfortable, because clean and neat. The old-fashioned chairs were very
bright, and the walnut-wood table was like a looking-glass. A few
strange, antique portraits of the men and women of other days decorated
the stained walls; a cupboard with glass doors contained some books and
an ancient set of china. There was no superfluous ornament in the
room—not one modern piece of furniture, save a brace of workboxes and a
lady’s desk in rosewood, which stood on a side-table:
everything—including the carpet and curtains—looked at once well worn
and well saved.

Mr. St. John—sitting as still as one of the dusty pictures on the
walls, keeping his eyes fixed on the page he perused, and his lips
mutely sealed—was easy enough to examine. Had he been a statue instead
of a man, he could not have been easier. He was young—perhaps from
twenty-eight to thirty—tall, slender; his face riveted the eye; it was
like a Greek face, very pure in outline: quite a straight, classic
nose; quite an Athenian mouth and chin. It is seldom, indeed, an
English face comes so near the antique models as did his. He might well
be a little shocked at the irregularity of my lineaments, his own being
so harmonious. His eyes were large and blue, with brown lashes; his
high forehead, colourless as ivory, was partially streaked over by
careless locks of fair hair.

This is a gentle delineation, is it not, reader? Yet he whom it
describes scarcely impressed one with the idea of a gentle, a yielding,
an impressible, or even of a placid nature. Quiescent as he now sat,
there was something about his nostril, his mouth, his brow, which, to
my perceptions, indicated elements within either restless, or hard, or
eager. He did not speak to me one word, nor even direct to me one
glance, till his sisters returned. Diana, as she passed in and out, in
the course of preparing tea, brought me a little cake, baked on the top
of the oven.

“Eat that now,” she said: “you must be hungry. Hannah says you have had
nothing but some gruel since breakfast.”

I did not refuse it, for my appetite was awakened and keen. Mr. Rivers
now closed his book, approached the table, and, as he took a seat,
fixed his blue pictorial-looking eyes full on me. There was an
unceremonious directness, a searching, decided steadfastness in his
gaze now, which told that intention, and not diffidence, had hitherto
kept it averted from the stranger.

“You are very hungry,” he said.

“I am, sir.” It is my way—it always was my way, by instinct—ever to
meet the brief with brevity, the direct with plainness.

“It is well for you that a low fever has forced you to abstain for the
last three days: there would have been danger in yielding to the
cravings of your appetite at first. Now you may eat, though still not
immoderately.”

“I trust I shall not eat long at your expense, sir,” was my very
clumsily-contrived, unpolished answer.

“No,” he said coolly: “when you have indicated to us the residence of
your friends, we can write to them, and you may be restored to home.”

“That, I must plainly tell you, is out of my power to do; being
absolutely without home and friends.”

The three looked at me, but not distrustfully; I felt there was no
suspicion in their glances: there was more of curiosity. I speak
particularly of the young ladies. St. John’s eyes, though clear enough
in a literal sense, in a figurative one were difficult to fathom. He
seemed to use them rather as instruments to search other people’s
thoughts, than as agents to reveal his own: the which combination of
keenness and reserve was considerably more calculated to embarrass than
to encourage.

“Do you mean to say,” he asked, “that you are completely isolated from
every connection?”

“I do. Not a tie links me to any living thing: not a claim do I possess
to admittance under any roof in England.”

“A most singular position at your age!”

Here I saw his glance directed to my hands, which were folded on the
table before me. I wondered what he sought there: his words soon
explained the quest.

“You have never been married? You are a spinster?”

Diana laughed. “Why, she can’t be above seventeen or eighteen years
old, St. John,” said she.

“I am near nineteen: but I am not married. No.”

I felt a burning glow mount to my face; for bitter and agitating
recollections were awakened by the allusion to marriage. They all saw
the embarrassment and the emotion. Diana and Mary relieved me by
turning their eyes elsewhere than to my crimsoned visage; but the
colder and sterner brother continued to gaze, till the trouble he had
excited forced out tears as well as colour.

“Where did you last reside?” he now asked.

“You are too inquisitive, St. John,” murmured Mary in a low voice; but
he leaned over the table and required an answer by a second firm and
piercing look.

“The name of the place where, and of the person with whom I lived, is
my secret,” I replied concisely.

“Which, if you like, you have, in my opinion, a right to keep, both
from St. John and every other questioner,” remarked Diana.

“Yet if I know nothing about you or your history, I cannot help you,”
he said. “And you need help, do you not?”

“I need it, and I seek it so far, sir, that some true philanthropist
will put me in the way of getting work which I can do, and the
remuneration for which will keep me, if but in the barest necessaries
of life.”

“I know not whether I am a true philanthropist; yet I am willing to aid
you to the utmost of my power in a purpose so honest. First, then, tell
me what you have been accustomed to do, and what you _can_ do.”

I had now swallowed my tea. I was mightily refreshed by the beverage;
as much so as a giant with wine: it gave new tone to my unstrung
nerves, and enabled me to address this penetrating young judge
steadily.

“Mr. Rivers,” I said, turning to him, and looking at him, as he looked
at me, openly and without diffidence, “you and your sisters have done
me a great service—the greatest man can do his fellow-being; you have
rescued me, by your noble hospitality, from death. This benefit
conferred gives you an unlimited claim on my gratitude, and a claim, to
a certain extent, on my confidence. I will tell you as much of the
history of the wanderer you have harboured, as I can tell without
compromising my own peace of mind—my own security, moral and physical,
and that of others.

“I am an orphan, the daughter of a clergyman. My parents died before I
could know them. I was brought up a dependent; educated in a charitable
institution. I will even tell you the name of the establishment, where
I passed six years as a pupil, and two as a teacher—Lowood Orphan
Asylum, ——shire: you will have heard of it, Mr. Rivers?—the Rev. Robert
Brocklehurst is the treasurer.”

“I have heard of Mr. Brocklehurst, and I have seen the school.”

“I left Lowood nearly a year since to become a private governess. I
obtained a good situation, and was happy. This place I was obliged to
leave four days before I came here. The reason of my departure I cannot
and ought not to explain: it would be useless, dangerous, and would
sound incredible. No blame attached to me: I am as free from
culpability as any one of you three. Miserable I am, and must be for a
time; for the catastrophe which drove me from a house I had found a
paradise was of a strange and direful nature. I observed but two points
in planning my departure—speed, secrecy: to secure these, I had to
leave behind me everything I possessed except a small parcel; which, in
my hurry and trouble of mind, I forgot to take out of the coach that
brought me to Whitcross. To this neighbourhood, then, I came, quite
destitute. I slept two nights in the open air, and wandered about two
days without crossing a threshold: but twice in that space of time did
I taste food; and it was when brought by hunger, exhaustion, and
despair almost to the last gasp, that you, Mr. Rivers, forbade me to
perish of want at your door, and took me under the shelter of your
roof. I know all your sisters have done for me since—for I have not
been insensible during my seeming torpor—and I owe to their
spontaneous, genuine, genial compassion as large a debt as to your
evangelical charity.”

“Don’t make her talk any more now, St. John,” said Diana, as I paused;
“she is evidently not yet fit for excitement. Come to the sofa and sit
down now, Miss Elliott.”

I gave an involuntary half start at hearing the _alias_: I had
forgotten my new name. Mr. Rivers, whom nothing seemed to escape,
noticed it at once.

“You said your name was Jane Elliott?” he observed.

“I did say so; and it is the name by which I think it expedient to be
called at present, but it is not my real name, and when I hear it, it
sounds strange to me.”

“Your real name you will not give?”

“No: I fear discovery above all things; and whatever disclosure would
lead to it, I avoid.”

“You are quite right, I am sure,” said Diana. “Now do, brother, let her
be at peace a while.”

But when St. John had mused a few moments he recommenced as
imperturbably and with as much acumen as ever.

“You would not like to be long dependent on our hospitality—you would
wish, I see, to dispense as soon as may be with my sisters’ compassion,
and, above all, with my _charity_ (I am quite sensible of the
distinction drawn, nor do I resent it—it is just): you desire to be
independent of us?”

“I do: I have already said so. Show me how to work, or how to seek
work: that is all I now ask; then let me go, if it be but to the
meanest cottage; but till then, allow me to stay here: I dread another
essay of the horrors of homeless destitution.”

“Indeed you _shall_ stay here,” said Diana, putting her white hand on
my head. “You _shall_,” repeated Mary, in the tone of undemonstrative
sincerity which seemed natural to her.

“My sisters, you see, have a pleasure in keeping you,” said Mr. St.
John, “as they would have a pleasure in keeping and cherishing a
half-frozen bird, some wintry wind might have driven through their
casement. _I_ feel more inclination to put you in the way of keeping
yourself, and shall endeavour to do so; but observe, my sphere is
narrow. I am but the incumbent of a poor country parish: my aid must be
of the humblest sort. And if you are inclined to despise the day of
small things, seek some more efficient succour than such as I can
offer.”

“She has already said that she is willing to do anything honest she
_can_ do,” answered Diana for me; “and you know, St. John, she has no
choice of helpers: she is forced to put up with such crusty people as
you.”

“I will be a dressmaker; I will be a plain-workwoman; I will be a
servant, a nurse-girl, if I can be no better,” I answered.

“Right,” said Mr. St. John, quite coolly. “If such is your spirit, I
promise to aid you, in my own time and way.”

He now resumed the book with which he had been occupied before tea. I
soon withdrew, for I had talked as much, and sat up as long, as my
present strength would permit.




CHAPTER XXX


The more I knew of the inmates of Moor House, the better I liked them.
In a few days I had so far recovered my health that I could sit up all
day, and walk out sometimes. I could join with Diana and Mary in all
their occupations; converse with them as much as they wished, and aid
them when and where they would allow me. There was a reviving pleasure
in this intercourse, of a kind now tasted by me for the first time—the
pleasure arising from perfect congeniality of tastes, sentiments, and
principles.

I liked to read what they liked to read: what they enjoyed, delighted
me; what they approved, I reverenced. They loved their sequestered
home. I, too, in the grey, small, antique structure, with its low roof,
its latticed casements, its mouldering walls, its avenue of aged
firs—all grown aslant under the stress of mountain winds; its garden,
dark with yew and holly—and where no flowers but of the hardiest
species would bloom—found a charm both potent and permanent. They clung
to the purple moors behind and around their dwelling—to the hollow vale
into which the pebbly bridle-path leading from their gate descended,
and which wound between fern-banks first, and then amongst a few of the
wildest little pasture-fields that ever bordered a wilderness of heath,
or gave sustenance to a flock of grey moorland sheep, with their little
mossy-faced lambs:—they clung to this scene, I say, with a perfect
enthusiasm of attachment. I could comprehend the feeling, and share
both its strength and truth. I saw the fascination of the locality. I
felt the consecration of its loneliness: my eye feasted on the outline
of swell and sweep—on the wild colouring communicated to ridge and dell
by moss, by heath-bell, by flower-sprinkled turf, by brilliant bracken,
and mellow granite crag. These details were just to me what they were
to them—so many pure and sweet sources of pleasure. The strong blast
and the soft breeze; the rough and the halcyon day; the hours of
sunrise and sunset; the moonlight and the clouded night, developed for
me, in these regions, the same attraction as for them—wound round my
faculties the same spell that entranced theirs.

Indoors we agreed equally well. They were both more accomplished and
better read than I was; but with eagerness I followed in the path of
knowledge they had trodden before me. I devoured the books they lent
me: then it was full satisfaction to discuss with them in the evening
what I had perused during the day. Thought fitted thought; opinion met
opinion: we coincided, in short, perfectly.

If in our trio there was a superior and a leader, it was Diana.
Physically, she far excelled me: she was handsome; she was vigorous. In
her animal spirits there was an affluence of life and certainty of
flow, such as excited my wonder, while it baffled my comprehension. I
could talk a while when the evening commenced, but the first gush of
vivacity and fluency gone, I was fain to sit on a stool at Diana’s
feet, to rest my head on her knee, and listen alternately to her and
Mary, while they sounded thoroughly the topic on which I had but
touched. Diana offered to teach me German. I liked to learn of her: I
saw the part of instructress pleased and suited her; that of scholar
pleased and suited me no less. Our natures dovetailed: mutual
affection—of the strongest kind—was the result. They discovered I could
draw: their pencils and colour-boxes were immediately at my service. My
skill, greater in this one point than theirs, surprised and charmed
them. Mary would sit and watch me by the hour together: then she would
take lessons; and a docile, intelligent, assiduous pupil she made. Thus
occupied, and mutually entertained, days passed like hours, and weeks
like days.

As to Mr. St John, the intimacy which had arisen so naturally and
rapidly between me and his sisters did not extend to him. One reason of
the distance yet observed between us was, that he was comparatively
seldom at home: a large proportion of his time appeared devoted to
visiting the sick and poor among the scattered population of his
parish.

No weather seemed to hinder him in these pastoral excursions: rain or
fair, he would, when his hours of morning study were over, take his
hat, and, followed by his father’s old pointer, Carlo, go out on his
mission of love or duty—I scarcely know in which light he regarded it.
Sometimes, when the day was very unfavourable, his sisters would
expostulate. He would then say, with a peculiar smile, more solemn than
cheerful—

“And if I let a gust of wind or a sprinkling of rain turn me aside from
these easy tasks, what preparation would such sloth be for the future I
propose to myself?”

Diana and Mary’s general answer to this question was a sigh, and some
minutes of apparently mournful meditation.

But besides his frequent absences, there was another barrier to
friendship with him: he seemed of a reserved, an abstracted, and even
of a brooding nature. Zealous in his ministerial labours, blameless in
his life and habits, he yet did not appear to enjoy that mental
serenity, that inward content, which should be the reward of every
sincere Christian and practical philanthropist. Often, of an evening,
when he sat at the window, his desk and papers before him, he would
cease reading or writing, rest his chin on his hand, and deliver
himself up to I know not what course of thought; but that it was
perturbed and exciting might be seen in the frequent flash and
changeful dilation of his eye.

I think, moreover, that Nature was not to him that treasury of delight
it was to his sisters. He expressed once, and but once in my hearing, a
strong sense of the rugged charm of the hills, and an inborn affection
for the dark roof and hoary walls he called his home; but there was
more of gloom than pleasure in the tone and words in which the
sentiment was manifested; and never did he seem to roam the moors for
the sake of their soothing silence—never seek out or dwell upon the
thousand peaceful delights they could yield.

Incommunicative as he was, some time elapsed before I had an
opportunity of gauging his mind. I first got an idea of its calibre
when I heard him preach in his own church at Morton. I wish I could
describe that sermon: but it is past my power. I cannot even render
faithfully the effect it produced on me.

It began calm—and indeed, as far as delivery and pitch of voice went,
it was calm to the end: an earnestly felt, yet strictly restrained zeal
breathed soon in the distinct accents, and prompted the nervous
language. This grew to force—compressed, condensed, controlled. The
heart was thrilled, the mind astonished, by the power of the preacher:
neither were softened. Throughout there was a strange bitterness; an
absence of consolatory gentleness; stern allusions to Calvinistic
doctrines—election, predestination, reprobation—were frequent; and each
reference to these points sounded like a sentence pronounced for doom.
When he had done, instead of feeling better, calmer, more enlightened
by his discourse, I experienced an inexpressible sadness; for it seemed
to me—I know not whether equally so to others—that the eloquence to
which I had been listening had sprung from a depth where lay turbid
dregs of disappointment—where moved troubling impulses of insatiate
yearnings and disquieting aspirations. I was sure St. John
Rivers—pure-lived, conscientious, zealous as he was—had not yet found
that peace of God which passeth all understanding: he had no more found
it, I thought, than had I with my concealed and racking regrets for my
broken idol and lost elysium—regrets to which I have latterly avoided
referring, but which possessed me and tyrannised over me ruthlessly.

Meantime a month was gone. Diana and Mary were soon to leave Moor
House, and return to the far different life and scene which awaited
them, as governesses in a large, fashionable, south-of-England city,
where each held a situation in families by whose wealthy and haughty
members they were regarded only as humble dependents, and who neither
knew nor sought out their innate excellences, and appreciated only
their acquired accomplishments as they appreciated the skill of their
cook or the taste of their waiting-woman. Mr. St. John had said nothing
to me yet about the employment he had promised to obtain for me; yet it
became urgent that I should have a vocation of some kind. One morning,
being left alone with him a few minutes in the parlour, I ventured to
approach the window-recess—which his table, chair, and desk consecrated
as a kind of study—and I was going to speak, though not very well
knowing in what words to frame my inquiry—for it is at all times
difficult to break the ice of reserve glassing over such natures as
his—when he saved me the trouble by being the first to commence a
dialogue.

Looking up as I drew near—“You have a question to ask of me?” he said.

“Yes; I wish to know whether you have heard of any service I can offer
myself to undertake?”

“I found or devised something for you three weeks ago; but as you
seemed both useful and happy here—as my sisters had evidently become
attached to you, and your society gave them unusual pleasure—I deemed
it inexpedient to break in on your mutual comfort till their
approaching departure from Marsh End should render yours necessary.”

“And they will go in three days now?” I said.

“Yes; and when they go, I shall return to the parsonage at Morton:
Hannah will accompany me; and this old house will be shut up.”

I waited a few moments, expecting he would go on with the subject first
broached: but he seemed to have entered another train of reflection:
his look denoted abstraction from me and my business. I was obliged to
recall him to a theme which was of necessity one of close and anxious
interest to me.

“What is the employment you had in view, Mr. Rivers? I hope this delay
will not have increased the difficulty of securing it.”

“Oh, no; since it is an employment which depends only on me to give,
and you to accept.”

He again paused: there seemed a reluctance to continue. I grew
impatient: a restless movement or two, and an eager and exacting glance
fastened on his face, conveyed the feeling to him as effectually as
words could have done, and with less trouble.

“You need be in no hurry to hear,” he said: “let me frankly tell you, I
have nothing eligible or profitable to suggest. Before I explain,
recall, if you please, my notice, clearly given, that if I helped you,
it must be as the blind man would help the lame. I am poor; for I find
that, when I have paid my father’s debts, all the patrimony remaining
to me will be this crumbling grange, the row of scathed firs behind,
and the patch of moorish soil, with the yew-trees and holly-bushes in
front. I am obscure: Rivers is an old name; but of the three sole
descendants of the race, two earn the dependent’s crust among
strangers, and the third considers himself an alien from his native
country—not only for life, but in death. Yes, and deems, and is bound
to deem, himself honoured by the lot, and aspires but after the day
when the cross of separation from fleshly ties shall be laid on his
shoulders, and when the Head of that church-militant of whose humblest
members he is one, shall give the word, ‘Rise, follow Me!’”

St. John said these words as he pronounced his sermons, with a quiet,
deep voice; with an unflushed cheek, and a coruscating radiance of
glance. He resumed—

“And since I am myself poor and obscure, I can offer you but a service
of poverty and obscurity. _You_ may even think it degrading—for I see
now your habits have been what the world calls refined: your tastes
lean to the ideal, and your society has at least been amongst the
educated; but _I_ consider that no service degrades which can better
our race. I hold that the more arid and unreclaimed the soil where the
Christian labourer’s task of tillage is appointed him—the scantier the
meed his toil brings—the higher the honour. His, under such
circumstances, is the destiny of the pioneer; and the first pioneers of
the Gospel were the Apostles—their captain was Jesus, the Redeemer,
Himself.”

“Well?” I said, as he again paused—“proceed.”

He looked at me before he proceeded: indeed, he seemed leisurely to
read my face, as if its features and lines were characters on a page.
The conclusions drawn from this scrutiny he partially expressed in his
succeeding observations.

“I believe you will accept the post I offer you,” said he, “and hold it
for a while: not permanently, though: any more than I could permanently
keep the narrow and narrowing—the tranquil, hidden office of English
country incumbent; for in your nature is an alloy as detrimental to
repose as that in mine, though of a different kind.”

“Do explain,” I urged, when he halted once more.

“I will; and you shall hear how poor the proposal is,—how trivial—how
cramping. I shall not stay long at Morton, now that my father is dead,
and that I am my own master. I shall leave the place probably in the
course of a twelve-month; but while I do stay, I will exert myself to
the utmost for its improvement. Morton, when I came to it two years
ago, had no school: the children of the poor were excluded from every
hope of progress. I established one for boys: I mean now to open a
second school for girls. I have hired a building for the purpose, with
a cottage of two rooms attached to it for the mistress’s house. Her
salary will be thirty pounds a year: her house is already furnished,
very simply, but sufficiently, by the kindness of a lady, Miss Oliver;
the only daughter of the sole rich man in my parish—Mr. Oliver, the
proprietor of a needle-factory and iron-foundry in the valley. The same
lady pays for the education and clothing of an orphan from the
workhouse, on condition that she shall aid the mistress in such menial
offices connected with her own house and the school as her occupation
of teaching will prevent her having time to discharge in person. Will
you be this mistress?”

He put the question rather hurriedly; he seemed half to expect an
indignant, or at least a disdainful rejection of the offer: not knowing
all my thoughts and feelings, though guessing some, he could not tell
in what light the lot would appear to me. In truth it was humble—but
then it was sheltered, and I wanted a safe asylum: it was plodding—but
then, compared with that of a governess in a rich house, it was
independent; and the fear of servitude with strangers entered my soul
like iron: it was not ignoble—not unworthy—not mentally degrading, I
made my decision.

“I thank you for the proposal, Mr. Rivers, and I accept it with all my
heart.”

“But you comprehend me?” he said. “It is a village school: your
scholars will be only poor girls—cottagers’ children—at the best,
farmers’ daughters. Knitting, sewing, reading, writing, ciphering, will
be all you will have to teach. What will you do with your
accomplishments? What, with the largest portion of your
mind—sentiments—tastes?”

“Save them till they are wanted. They will keep.”

“You know what you undertake, then?”

“I do.”

He now smiled: and not a bitter or a sad smile, but one well pleased
and deeply gratified.

“And when will you commence the exercise of your function?”

“I will go to my house to-morrow, and open the school, if you like,
next week.”

“Very well: so be it.”

He rose and walked through the room. Standing still, he again looked at
me. He shook his head.

“What do you disapprove of, Mr. Rivers?” I asked.

“You will not stay at Morton long: no, no!”

“Why? What is your reason for saying so?”

“I read it in your eye; it is not of that description which promises
the maintenance of an even tenor in life.”

“I am not ambitious.”

He started at the word “ambitious.” He repeated, “No. What made you
think of ambition? Who is ambitious? I know I am: but how did you find
it out?”

“I was speaking of myself.”

“Well, if you are not ambitious, you are—” He paused.

“What?”

“I was going to say, impassioned: but perhaps you would have
misunderstood the word, and been displeased. I mean, that human
affections and sympathies have a most powerful hold on you. I am sure
you cannot long be content to pass your leisure in solitude, and to
devote your working hours to a monotonous labour wholly void of
stimulus: any more than I can be content,” he added, with emphasis, “to
live here buried in morass, pent in with mountains—my nature, that God
gave me, contravened; my faculties, heaven-bestowed, paralysed—made
useless. You hear now how I contradict myself. I, who preached
contentment with a humble lot, and justified the vocation even of
hewers of wood and drawers of water in God’s service—I, His ordained
minister, almost rave in my restlessness. Well, propensities and
principles must be reconciled by some means.”

He left the room. In this brief hour I had learnt more of him than in
the whole previous month: yet still he puzzled me.

Diana and Mary Rivers became more sad and silent as the day approached
for leaving their brother and their home. They both tried to appear as
usual; but the sorrow they had to struggle against was one that could
not be entirely conquered or concealed. Diana intimated that this would
be a different parting from any they had ever yet known. It would
probably, as far as St. John was concerned, be a parting for years: it
might be a parting for life.

“He will sacrifice all to his long-framed resolves,” she said: “natural
affection and feelings more potent still. St. John looks quiet, Jane;
but he hides a fever in his vitals. You would think him gentle, yet in
some things he is inexorable as death; and the worst of it is, my
conscience will hardly permit me to dissuade him from his severe
decision: certainly, I cannot for a moment blame him for it. It is
right, noble, Christian: yet it breaks my heart!” And the tears gushed
to her fine eyes. Mary bent her head low over her work.

“We are now without father: we shall soon be without home and brother,”
she murmured.

At that moment a little accident supervened, which seemed decreed by
fate purposely to prove the truth of the adage, that “misfortunes never
come singly,” and to add to their distresses the vexing one of the slip
between the cup and the lip. St. John passed the window reading a
letter. He entered.

“Our uncle John is dead,” said he.

Both the sisters seemed struck: not shocked or appalled; the tidings
appeared in their eyes rather momentous than afflicting.

“Dead?” repeated Diana.

“Yes.”

She riveted a searching gaze on her brother’s face. “And what then?”
she demanded, in a low voice.

“What then, Die?” he replied, maintaining a marble immobility of
feature. “What then? Why—nothing. Read.”

He threw the letter into her lap. She glanced over it, and handed it to
Mary. Mary perused it in silence, and returned it to her brother. All
three looked at each other, and all three smiled—a dreary, pensive
smile enough.

“Amen! We can yet live,” said Diana at last.

“At any rate, it makes us no worse off than we were before,” remarked
Mary.

“Only it forces rather strongly on the mind the picture of what _might
have been_,” said Mr. Rivers, “and contrasts it somewhat too vividly
with what _is_.”

He folded the letter, locked it in his desk, and again went out.

For some minutes no one spoke. Diana then turned to me.

“Jane, you will wonder at us and our mysteries,” she said, “and think
us hard-hearted beings not to be more moved at the death of so near a
relation as an uncle; but we have never seen him or known him. He was
my mother’s brother. My father and he quarrelled long ago. It was by
his advice that my father risked most of his property in the
speculation that ruined him. Mutual recrimination passed between them:
they parted in anger, and were never reconciled. My uncle engaged
afterwards in more prosperous undertakings: it appears he realised a
fortune of twenty thousand pounds. He was never married, and had no
near kindred but ourselves and one other person, not more closely
related than we. My father always cherished the idea that he would
atone for his error by leaving his possessions to us; that letter
informs us that he has bequeathed every penny to the other relation,
with the exception of thirty guineas, to be divided between St. John,
Diana, and Mary Rivers, for the purchase of three mourning rings. He
had a right, of course, to do as he pleased: and yet a momentary damp
is cast on the spirits by the receipt of such news. Mary and I would
have esteemed ourselves rich with a thousand pounds each; and to St.
John such a sum would have been valuable, for the good it would have
enabled him to do.”

This explanation given, the subject was dropped, and no further
reference made to it by either Mr. Rivers or his sisters. The next day
I left Marsh End for Morton. The day after, Diana and Mary quitted it
for distant B——. In a week, Mr. Rivers and Hannah repaired to the
parsonage: and so the old grange was abandoned.




CHAPTER XXXI


My home, then, when I at last find a home,—is a cottage; a little room
with whitewashed walls and a sanded floor, containing four painted
chairs and a table, a clock, a cupboard, with two or three plates and
dishes, and a set of tea-things in delf. Above, a chamber of the same
dimensions as the kitchen, with a deal bedstead and chest of drawers;
small, yet too large to be filled with my scanty wardrobe: though the
kindness of my gentle and generous friends has increased that, by a
modest stock of such things as are necessary.

It is evening. I have dismissed, with the fee of an orange, the little
orphan who serves me as a handmaid. I am sitting alone on the hearth.
This morning, the village school opened. I had twenty scholars. But
three of the number can read: none write or cipher. Several knit, and a
few sew a little. They speak with the broadest accent of the district.
At present, they and I have a difficulty in understanding each other’s
language. Some of them are unmannered, rough, intractable, as well as
ignorant; but others are docile, have a wish to learn, and evince a
disposition that pleases me. I must not forget that these coarsely-clad
little peasants are of flesh and blood as good as the scions of
gentlest genealogy; and that the germs of native excellence,
refinement, intelligence, kind feeling, are as likely to exist in their
hearts as in those of the best-born. My duty will be to develop these
germs: surely I shall find some happiness in discharging that office.
Much enjoyment I do not expect in the life opening before me: yet it
will, doubtless, if I regulate my mind, and exert my powers as I ought,
yield me enough to live on from day to day.

Was I very gleeful, settled, content, during the hours I passed in
yonder bare, humble schoolroom this morning and afternoon? Not to
deceive myself, I must reply—No: I felt desolate to a degree. I
felt—yes, idiot that I am—I felt degraded. I doubted I had taken a step
which sank instead of raising me in the scale of social existence. I
was weakly dismayed at the ignorance, the poverty, the coarseness of
all I heard and saw round me. But let me not hate and despise myself
too much for these feelings; I know them to be wrong—that is a great
step gained; I shall strive to overcome them. To-morrow, I trust, I
shall get the better of them partially; and in a few weeks, perhaps,
they will be quite subdued. In a few months, it is possible, the
happiness of seeing progress, and a change for the better in my
scholars may substitute gratification for disgust.

Meantime, let me ask myself one question—Which is better?—To have
surrendered to temptation; listened to passion; made no painful
effort—no struggle;—but to have sunk down in the silken snare; fallen
asleep on the flowers covering it; wakened in a southern clime, amongst
the luxuries of a pleasure villa: to have been now living in France,
Mr. Rochester’s mistress; delirious with his love half my time—for he
would—oh, yes, he would have loved me well for a while. He _did_ love
me—no one will ever love me so again. I shall never more know the sweet
homage given to beauty, youth, and grace—for never to any one else
shall I seem to possess these charms. He was fond and proud of me—it is
what no man besides will ever be.—But where am I wandering, and what am
I saying, and above all, feeling? Whether is it better, I ask, to be a
slave in a fool’s paradise at Marseilles—fevered with delusive bliss
one hour—suffocating with the bitterest tears of remorse and shame the
next—or to be a village-schoolmistress, free and honest, in a breezy
mountain nook in the healthy heart of England?

Yes; I feel now that I was right when I adhered to principle and law,
and scorned and crushed the insane promptings of a frenzied moment. God
directed me to a correct choice: I thank His providence for the
guidance!

Having brought my eventide musings to this point, I rose, went to my
door, and looked at the sunset of the harvest-day, and at the quiet
fields before my cottage, which, with the school, was distant half a
mile from the village. The birds were singing their last strains—

“The air was mild, the dew was balm.”


While I looked, I thought myself happy, and was surprised to find
myself ere long weeping—and why? For the doom which had reft me from
adhesion to my master: for him I was no more to see; for the desperate
grief and fatal fury—consequences of my departure—which might now,
perhaps, be dragging him from the path of right, too far to leave hope
of ultimate restoration thither. At this thought, I turned my face
aside from the lovely sky of eve and lonely vale of Morton—I say
_lonely_, for in that bend of it visible to me there was no building
apparent save the church and the parsonage, half-hid in trees, and,
quite at the extremity, the roof of Vale Hall, where the rich Mr.
Oliver and his daughter lived. I hid my eyes, and leant my head against
the stone frame of my door; but soon a slight noise near the wicket
which shut in my tiny garden from the meadow beyond it made me look up.
A dog—old Carlo, Mr. Rivers’ pointer, as I saw in a moment—was pushing
the gate with his nose, and St. John himself leant upon it with folded
arms; his brow knit, his gaze, grave almost to displeasure, fixed on
me. I asked him to come in.

“No, I cannot stay; I have only brought you a little parcel my sisters
left for you. I think it contains a colour-box, pencils, and paper.”

I approached to take it: a welcome gift it was. He examined my face, I
thought, with austerity, as I came near: the traces of tears were
doubtless very visible upon it.

“Have you found your first day’s work harder than you expected?” he
asked.

“Oh, no! On the contrary, I think in time I shall get on with my
scholars very well.”

“But perhaps your accommodations—your cottage—your furniture—have
disappointed your expectations? They are, in truth, scanty enough;
but—” I interrupted—

“My cottage is clean and weather-proof; my furniture sufficient and
commodious. All I see has made me thankful, not despondent. I am not
absolutely such a fool and sensualist as to regret the absence of a
carpet, a sofa, and silver plate; besides, five weeks ago I had
nothing—I was an outcast, a beggar, a vagrant; now I have acquaintance,
a home, a business. I wonder at the goodness of God; the generosity of
my friends; the bounty of my lot. I do not repine.”

“But you feel solitude an oppression? The little house there behind you
is dark and empty.”

“I have hardly had time yet to enjoy a sense of tranquillity, much less
to grow impatient under one of loneliness.”

“Very well; I hope you feel the content you express: at any rate, your
good sense will tell you that it is too soon yet to yield to the
vacillating fears of Lot’s wife. What you had left before I saw you, of
course I do not know; but I counsel you to resist firmly every
temptation which would incline you to look back: pursue your present
career steadily, for some months at least.”

“It is what I mean to do,” I answered. St. John continued—

“It is hard work to control the workings of inclination and turn the
bent of nature; but that it may be done, I know from experience. God
has given us, in a measure, the power to make our own fate; and when
our energies seem to demand a sustenance they cannot get—when our will
strains after a path we may not follow—we need neither starve from
inanition, nor stand still in despair: we have but to seek another
nourishment for the mind, as strong as the forbidden food it longed to
taste—and perhaps purer; and to hew out for the adventurous foot a road
as direct and broad as the one Fortune has blocked up against us, if
rougher than it.

“A year ago I was myself intensely miserable, because I thought I had
made a mistake in entering the ministry: its uniform duties wearied me
to death. I burnt for the more active life of the world—for the more
exciting toils of a literary career—for the destiny of an artist,
author, orator; anything rather than that of a priest: yes, the heart
of a politician, of a soldier, of a votary of glory, a lover of renown,
a luster after power, beat under my curate’s surplice. I considered; my
life was so wretched, it must be changed, or I must die. After a season
of darkness and struggling, light broke and relief fell: my cramped
existence all at once spread out to a plain without bounds—my powers
heard a call from heaven to rise, gather their full strength, spread
their wings, and mount beyond ken. God had an errand for me; to bear
which afar, to deliver it well, skill and strength, courage and
eloquence, the best qualifications of soldier, statesman, and orator,
were all needed: for these all centre in the good missionary.

“A missionary I resolved to be. From that moment my state of mind
changed; the fetters dissolved and dropped from every faculty, leaving
nothing of bondage but its galling soreness—which time only can heal.
My father, indeed, imposed the determination, but since his death, I
have not a legitimate obstacle to contend with; some affairs settled, a
successor for Morton provided, an entanglement or two of the feelings
broken through or cut asunder—a last conflict with human weakness, in
which I know I shall overcome, because I have vowed that I _will_
overcome—and I leave Europe for the East.”

He said this, in his peculiar, subdued, yet emphatic voice; looking,
when he had ceased speaking, not at me, but at the setting sun, at
which I looked too. Both he and I had our backs towards the path
leading up the field to the wicket. We had heard no step on that
grass-grown track; the water running in the vale was the one lulling
sound of the hour and scene; we might well then start when a gay voice,
sweet as a silver bell, exclaimed—

“Good evening, Mr. Rivers. And good evening, old Carlo. Your dog is
quicker to recognise his friends than you are, sir; he pricked his ears
and wagged his tail when I was at the bottom of the field, and you have
your back towards me now.”

It was true. Though Mr. Rivers had started at the first of those
musical accents, as if a thunderbolt had split a cloud over his head,
he stood yet, at the close of the sentence, in the same attitude in
which the speaker had surprised him—his arm resting on the gate, his
face directed towards the west. He turned at last, with measured
deliberation. A vision, as it seemed to me, had risen at his side.
There appeared, within three feet of him, a form clad in pure white—a
youthful, graceful form: full, yet fine in contour; and when, after
bending to caress Carlo, it lifted up its head, and threw back a long
veil, there bloomed under his glance a face of perfect beauty. Perfect
beauty is a strong expression; but I do not retrace or qualify it: as
sweet features as ever the temperate clime of Albion moulded; as pure
hues of rose and lily as ever her humid gales and vapoury skies
generated and screened, justified, in this instance, the term. No charm
was wanting, no defect was perceptible; the young girl had regular and
delicate lineaments; eyes shaped and coloured as we see them in lovely
pictures, large, and dark, and full; the long and shadowy eyelash which
encircles a fine eye with so soft a fascination; the pencilled brow
which gives such clearness; the white smooth forehead, which adds such
repose to the livelier beauties of tint and ray; the cheek oval, fresh,
and smooth; the lips, fresh too, ruddy, healthy, sweetly formed; the
even and gleaming teeth without flaw; the small dimpled chin; the
ornament of rich, plenteous tresses—all advantages, in short, which,
combined, realise the ideal of beauty, were fully hers. I wondered, as
I looked at this fair creature: I admired her with my whole heart.
Nature had surely formed her in a partial mood; and, forgetting her
usual stinted step-mother dole of gifts, had endowed this, her darling,
with a grand-dame’s bounty.

What did St. John Rivers think of this earthly angel? I naturally asked
myself that question as I saw him turn to her and look at her; and, as
naturally, I sought the answer to the inquiry in his countenance. He
had already withdrawn his eye from the Peri, and was looking at a
humble tuft of daisies which grew by the wicket.

“A lovely evening, but late for you to be out alone,” he said, as he
crushed the snowy heads of the closed flowers with his foot.

“Oh, I only came home from S——” (she mentioned the name of a large town
some twenty miles distant) “this afternoon. Papa told me you had opened
your school, and that the new mistress was come; and so I put on my
bonnet after tea, and ran up the valley to see her: this is she?”
pointing to me.

“It is,” said St. John.

“Do you think you shall like Morton?” she asked of me, with a direct
and naïve simplicity of tone and manner, pleasing, if child-like.

“I hope I shall. I have many inducements to do so.”

“Did you find your scholars as attentive as you expected?”

“Quite.”

“Do you like your house?”

“Very much.”

“Have I furnished it nicely?”

“Very nicely, indeed.”

“And made a good choice of an attendant for you in Alice Wood?”

“You have indeed. She is teachable and handy.” (This then, I thought,
is Miss Oliver, the heiress; favoured, it seems, in the gifts of
fortune, as well as in those of nature! What happy combination of the
planets presided over her birth, I wonder?)

“I shall come up and help you to teach sometimes,” she added. “It will
be a change for me to visit you now and then; and I like a change. Mr.
Rivers, I have been _so_ gay during my stay at S——. Last night, or
rather this morning, I was dancing till two o’clock. The ——th regiment
are stationed there since the riots; and the officers are the most
agreeable men in the world: they put all our young knife-grinders and
scissor merchants to shame.”

It seemed to me that Mr. St. John’s under lip protruded, and his upper
lip curled a moment. His mouth certainly looked a good deal compressed,
and the lower part of his face unusually stern and square, as the
laughing girl gave him this information. He lifted his gaze, too, from
the daisies, and turned it on her. An unsmiling, a searching, a meaning
gaze it was. She answered it with a second laugh, and laughter well
became her youth, her roses, her dimples, her bright eyes.

As he stood, mute and grave, she again fell to caressing Carlo. “Poor
Carlo loves me,” said she. “_He_ is not stern and distant to his
friends; and if he could speak, he would not be silent.”

As she patted the dog’s head, bending with native grace before his
young and austere master, I saw a glow rise to that master’s face. I
saw his solemn eye melt with sudden fire, and flicker with resistless
emotion. Flushed and kindled thus, he looked nearly as beautiful for a
man as she for a woman. His chest heaved once, as if his large heart,
weary of despotic constriction, had expanded, despite the will, and
made a vigorous bound for the attainment of liberty. But he curbed it,
I think, as a resolute rider would curb a rearing steed. He responded
neither by word nor movement to the gentle advances made him.

“Papa says you never come to see us now,” continued Miss Oliver,
looking up. “You are quite a stranger at Vale Hall. He is alone this
evening, and not very well: will you return with me and visit him?”

“It is not a seasonable hour to intrude on Mr. Oliver,” answered St.
John.

“Not a seasonable hour! But I declare it is. It is just the hour when
papa most wants company: when the works are closed and he has no
business to occupy him. Now, Mr. Rivers, _do_ come. Why are you so very
shy, and so very sombre?” She filled up the hiatus his silence left by
a reply of her own.

“I forgot!” she exclaimed, shaking her beautiful curled head, as if
shocked at herself. “I am so giddy and thoughtless! _Do_ excuse me. It
had slipped my memory that you have good reasons to be indisposed for
joining in my chatter. Diana and Mary have left you, and Moor House is
shut up, and you are so lonely. I am sure I pity you. Do come and see
papa.”

“Not to-night, Miss Rosamond, not to-night.”

Mr. St. John spoke almost like an automaton: himself only knew the
effort it cost him thus to refuse.

“Well, if you are so obstinate, I will leave you; for I dare not stay
any longer: the dew begins to fall. Good evening!”

She held out her hand. He just touched it. “Good evening!” he repeated,
in a voice low and hollow as an echo. She turned, but in a moment
returned.

“Are you well?” she asked. Well might she put the question: his face
was blanched as her gown.

“Quite well,” he enunciated; and, with a bow, he left the gate. She
went one way; he another. She turned twice to gaze after him as she
tripped fairy-like down the field; he, as he strode firmly across,
never turned at all.

This spectacle of another’s suffering and sacrifice rapt my thoughts
from exclusive meditation on my own. Diana Rivers had designated her
brother “inexorable as death.” She had not exaggerated.




CHAPTER XXXII


I continued the labours of the village-school as actively and
faithfully as I could. It was truly hard work at first. Some time
elapsed before, with all my efforts, I could comprehend my scholars and
their nature. Wholly untaught, with faculties quite torpid, they seemed
to me hopelessly dull; and, at first sight, all dull alike: but I soon
found I was mistaken. There was a difference amongst them as amongst
the educated; and when I got to know them, and they me, this difference
rapidly developed itself. Their amazement at me, my language, my rules,
and ways, once subsided, I found some of these heavy-looking, gaping
rustics wake up into sharp-witted girls enough. Many showed themselves
obliging, and amiable too; and I discovered amongst them not a few
examples of natural politeness, and innate self-respect, as well as of
excellent capacity, that won both my goodwill and my admiration. These
soon took a pleasure in doing their work well, in keeping their persons
neat, in learning their tasks regularly, in acquiring quiet and orderly
manners. The rapidity of their progress, in some instances, was even
surprising; and an honest and happy pride I took in it: besides, I
began personally to like some of the best girls; and they liked me. I
had amongst my scholars several farmers’ daughters: young women grown,
almost. These could already read, write, and sew; and to them I taught
the elements of grammar, geography, history, and the finer kinds of
needlework. I found estimable characters amongst them—characters
desirous of information and disposed for improvement—with whom I passed
many a pleasant evening hour in their own homes. Their parents then
(the farmer and his wife) loaded me with attentions. There was an
enjoyment in accepting their simple kindness, and in repaying it by a
consideration—a scrupulous regard to their feelings—to which they were
not, perhaps, at all times accustomed, and which both charmed and
benefited them; because, while it elevated them in their own eyes, it
made them emulous to merit the deferential treatment they received.

I felt I became a favourite in the neighbourhood. Whenever I went out,
I heard on all sides cordial salutations, and was welcomed with
friendly smiles. To live amidst general regard, though it be but the
regard of working people, is like “sitting in sunshine, calm and
sweet;” serene inward feelings bud and bloom under the ray. At this
period of my life, my heart far oftener swelled with thankfulness than
sank with dejection: and yet, reader, to tell you all, in the midst of
this calm, this useful existence—after a day passed in honourable
exertion amongst my scholars, an evening spent in drawing or reading
contentedly alone—I used to rush into strange dreams at night: dreams
many-coloured, agitated, full of the ideal, the stirring, the
stormy—dreams where, amidst unusual scenes, charged with adventure,
with agitating risk and romantic chance, I still again and again met
Mr. Rochester, always at some exciting crisis; and then the sense of
being in his arms, hearing his voice, meeting his eye, touching his
hand and cheek, loving him, being loved by him—the hope of passing a
lifetime at his side, would be renewed, with all its first force and
fire. Then I awoke. Then I recalled where I was, and how situated. Then
I rose up on my curtainless bed, trembling and quivering; and then the
still, dark night witnessed the convulsion of despair, and heard the
burst of passion. By nine o’clock the next morning I was punctually
opening the school; tranquil, settled, prepared for the steady duties
of the day.

Rosamond Oliver kept her word in coming to visit me. Her call at the
school was generally made in the course of her morning ride. She would
canter up to the door on her pony, followed by a mounted livery
servant. Anything more exquisite than her appearance, in her purple
habit, with her Amazon’s cap of black velvet placed gracefully above
the long curls that kissed her cheek and floated to her shoulders, can
scarcely be imagined: and it was thus she would enter the rustic
building, and glide through the dazzled ranks of the village children.
She generally came at the hour when Mr. Rivers was engaged in giving
his daily catechising lesson. Keenly, I fear, did the eye of the
visitress pierce the young pastor’s heart. A sort of instinct seemed to
warn him of her entrance, even when he did not see it; and when he was
looking quite away from the door, if she appeared at it, his cheek
would glow, and his marble-seeming features, though they refused to
relax, changed indescribably, and in their very quiescence became
expressive of a repressed fervour, stronger than working muscle or
darting glance could indicate.

Of course, she knew her power: indeed, he did not, because he could
not, conceal it from her. In spite of his Christian stoicism, when she
went up and addressed him, and smiled gaily, encouragingly, even fondly
in his face, his hand would tremble and his eye burn. He seemed to say,
with his sad and resolute look, if he did not say it with his lips, “I
love you, and I know you prefer me. It is not despair of success that
keeps me dumb. If I offered my heart, I believe you would accept it.
But that heart is already laid on a sacred altar: the fire is arranged
round it. It will soon be no more than a sacrifice consumed.”

And then she would pout like a disappointed child; a pensive cloud
would soften her radiant vivacity; she would withdraw her hand hastily
from his, and turn in transient petulance from his aspect, at once so
heroic and so martyr-like. St. John, no doubt, would have given the
world to follow, recall, retain her, when she thus left him; but he
would not give one chance of heaven, nor relinquish, for the elysium of
her love, one hope of the true, eternal Paradise. Besides, he could not
bind all that he had in his nature—the rover, the aspirant, the poet,
the priest—in the limits of a single passion. He could not—he would
not—renounce his wild field of mission warfare for the parlours and the
peace of Vale Hall. I learnt so much from himself in an inroad I once,
despite his reserve, had the daring to make on his confidence.

Miss Oliver already honoured me with frequent visits to my cottage. I
had learnt her whole character, which was without mystery or disguise:
she was coquettish but not heartless; exacting, but not worthlessly
selfish. She had been indulged from her birth, but was not absolutely
spoilt. She was hasty, but good-humoured; vain (she could not help it,
when every glance in the glass showed her such a flush of loveliness),
but not affected; liberal-handed; innocent of the pride of wealth;
ingenuous; sufficiently intelligent; gay, lively, and unthinking: she
was very charming, in short, even to a cool observer of her own sex
like me; but she was not profoundly interesting or thoroughly
impressive. A very different sort of mind was hers from that, for
instance, of the sisters of St. John. Still, I liked her almost as I
liked my pupil Adèle; except that, for a child whom we have watched
over and taught, a closer affection is engendered than we can give an
equally attractive adult acquaintance.

She had taken an amiable caprice to me. She said I was like Mr. Rivers,
only, certainly, she allowed, “not one-tenth so handsome, though I was
a nice neat little soul enough, but he was an angel.” I was, however,
good, clever, composed, and firm, like him. I was a _lusus naturæ_, she
affirmed, as a village schoolmistress: she was sure my previous
history, if known, would make a delightful romance.

One evening, while, with her usual child-like activity, and thoughtless
yet not offensive inquisitiveness, she was rummaging the cupboard and
the table-drawer of my little kitchen, she discovered first two French
books, a volume of Schiller, a German grammar and dictionary, and then
my drawing-materials and some sketches, including a pencil-head of a
pretty little cherub-like girl, one of my scholars, and sundry views
from nature, taken in the Vale of Morton and on the surrounding moors.
She was first transfixed with surprise, and then electrified with
delight.

“Had I done these pictures? Did I know French and German? What a
love—what a miracle I was! I drew better than her master in the first
school in S——. Would I sketch a portrait of her, to show to papa?”

“With pleasure,” I replied; and I felt a thrill of artist-delight at
the idea of copying from so perfect and radiant a model. She had then
on a dark-blue silk dress; her arms and her neck were bare; her only
ornament was her chestnut tresses, which waved over her shoulders with
all the wild grace of natural curls. I took a sheet of fine card-board,
and drew a careful outline. I promised myself the pleasure of colouring
it; and, as it was getting late then, I told her she must come and sit
another day.

She made such a report of me to her father, that Mr. Oliver himself
accompanied her next evening—a tall, massive-featured, middle-aged, and
grey-headed man, at whose side his lovely daughter looked like a bright
flower near a hoary turret. He appeared a taciturn, and perhaps a proud
personage; but he was very kind to me. The sketch of Rosamond’s
portrait pleased him highly: he said I must make a finished picture of
it. He insisted, too, on my coming the next day to spend the evening at
Vale Hall.

I went. I found it a large, handsome residence, showing abundant
evidences of wealth in the proprietor. Rosamond was full of glee and
pleasure all the time I stayed. Her father was affable; and when he
entered into conversation with me after tea, he expressed in strong
terms his approbation of what I had done in Morton school, and said he
only feared, from what he saw and heard, I was too good for the place,
and would soon quit it for one more suitable.

“Indeed,” cried Rosamond, “she is clever enough to be a governess in a
high family, papa.”

I thought I would far rather be where I am than in any high family in
the land. Mr. Oliver spoke of Mr. Rivers—of the Rivers family—with
great respect. He said it was a very old name in that neighbourhood;
that the ancestors of the house were wealthy; that all Morton had once
belonged to them; that even now he considered the representative of
that house might, if he liked, make an alliance with the best. He
accounted it a pity that so fine and talented a young man should have
formed the design of going out as a missionary; it was quite throwing a
valuable life away. It appeared, then, that her father would throw no
obstacle in the way of Rosamond’s union with St. John. Mr. Oliver
evidently regarded the young clergyman’s good birth, old name, and
sacred profession as sufficient compensation for the want of fortune.

It was the 5th of November, and a holiday. My little servant, after
helping me to clean my house, was gone, well satisfied with the fee of
a penny for her aid. All about me was spotless and bright—scoured
floor, polished grate, and well-rubbed chairs. I had also made myself
neat, and had now the afternoon before me to spend as I would.

The translation of a few pages of German occupied an hour; then I got
my palette and pencils, and fell to the more soothing, because easier
occupation, of completing Rosamond Oliver’s miniature. The head was
finished already: there was but the background to tint and the drapery
to shade off; a touch of carmine, too, to add to the ripe lips—a soft
curl here and there to the tresses—a deeper tinge to the shadow of the
lash under the azured eyelid. I was absorbed in the execution of these
nice details, when, after one rapid tap, my door unclosed, admitting
St. John Rivers.

“I am come to see how you are spending your holiday,” he said. “Not, I
hope, in thought? No, that is well: while you draw you will not feel
lonely. You see, I mistrust you still, though you have borne up
wonderfully so far. I have brought you a book for evening solace,” and
he laid on the table a new publication—a poem: one of those genuine
productions so often vouchsafed to the fortunate public of those
days—the golden age of modern literature. Alas! the readers of our era
are less favoured. But courage! I will not pause either to accuse or
repine. I know poetry is not dead, nor genius lost; nor has Mammon
gained power over either, to bind or slay: they will both assert their
existence, their presence, their liberty and strength again one day.
Powerful angels, safe in heaven! they smile when sordid souls triumph,
and feeble ones weep over their destruction. Poetry destroyed? Genius
banished? No! Mediocrity, no: do not let envy prompt you to the
thought. No; they not only live, but reign and redeem: and without
their divine influence spread everywhere, you would be in hell—the hell
of your own meanness.

While I was eagerly glancing at the bright pages of “Marmion” (for
“Marmion” it was), St. John stooped to examine my drawing. His tall
figure sprang erect again with a start: he said nothing. I looked up at
him: he shunned my eye. I knew his thoughts well, and could read his
heart plainly; at the moment I felt calmer and cooler than he: I had
then temporarily the advantage of him, and I conceived an inclination
to do him some good, if I could.

“With all his firmness and self-control,” thought I, “he tasks himself
too far: locks every feeling and pang within—expresses, confesses,
imparts nothing. I am sure it would benefit him to talk a little about
this sweet Rosamond, whom he thinks he ought not to marry: I will make
him talk.”

I said first, “Take a chair, Mr. Rivers.” But he answered, as he always
did, that he could not stay. “Very well,” I responded, mentally, “stand
if you like; but you shall not go just yet, I am determined: solitude
is at least as bad for you as it is for me. I’ll try if I cannot
discover the secret spring of your confidence, and find an aperture in
that marble breast through which I can shed one drop of the balm of
sympathy.”

“Is this portrait like?” I asked bluntly.

“Like! Like whom? I did not observe it closely.”

“You did, Mr. Rivers.”

He almost started at my sudden and strange abruptness: he looked at me
astonished. “Oh, that is nothing yet,” I muttered within. “I don’t mean
to be baffled by a little stiffness on your part; I’m prepared to go to
considerable lengths.” I continued, “You observed it closely and
distinctly; but I have no objection to your looking at it again,” and I
rose and placed it in his hand.

“A well-executed picture,” he said; “very soft, clear colouring; very
graceful and correct drawing.”

“Yes, yes; I know all that. But what of the resemblance? Who is it
like?”

Mastering some hesitation, he answered, “Miss Oliver, I presume.”

“Of course. And now, sir, to reward you for the accurate guess, I will
promise to paint you a careful and faithful duplicate of this very
picture, provided you admit that the gift would be acceptable to you. I
don’t wish to throw away my time and trouble on an offering you would
deem worthless.”

He continued to gaze at the picture: the longer he looked, the firmer
he held it, the more he seemed to covet it. “It is like!” he murmured;
“the eye is well managed: the colour, light, expression, are perfect.
It smiles!”

“Would it comfort, or would it wound you to have a similar painting?
Tell me that. When you are at Madagascar, or at the Cape, or in India,
would it be a consolation to have that memento in your possession? or
would the sight of it bring recollections calculated to enervate and
distress?”

He now furtively raised his eyes: he glanced at me, irresolute,
disturbed: he again surveyed the picture.

“That I should like to have it is certain: whether it would be
judicious or wise is another question.”

Since I had ascertained that Rosamond really preferred him, and that
her father was not likely to oppose the match, I—less exalted in my
views than St. John—had been strongly disposed in my own heart to
advocate their union. It seemed to me that, should he become the
possessor of Mr. Oliver’s large fortune, he might do as much good with
it as if he went and laid his genius out to wither, and his strength to
waste, under a tropical sun. With this persuasion I now answered—

“As far as I can see, it would be wiser and more judicious if you were
to take to yourself the original at once.”

By this time he had sat down: he had laid the picture on the table
before him, and with his brow supported on both hands, hung fondly over
it. I discerned he was now neither angry nor shocked at my audacity. I
saw even that to be thus frankly addressed on a subject he had deemed
unapproachable—to hear it thus freely handled—was beginning to be felt
by him as a new pleasure—an unhoped-for relief. Reserved people often
really need the frank discussion of their sentiments and griefs more
than the expansive. The sternest-seeming stoic is human after all; and
to “burst” with boldness and good-will into “the silent sea” of their
souls is often to confer on them the first of obligations.

“She likes you, I am sure,” said I, as I stood behind his chair, “and
her father respects you. Moreover, she is a sweet girl—rather
thoughtless; but you would have sufficient thought for both yourself
and her. You ought to marry her.”

“_Does_ she like me?” he asked.

“Certainly; better than she likes any one else. She talks of you
continually: there is no subject she enjoys so much or touches upon so
often.”

“It is very pleasant to hear this,” he said—“very: go on for another
quarter of an hour.” And he actually took out his watch and laid it
upon the table to measure the time.

“But where is the use of going on,” I asked, “when you are probably
preparing some iron blow of contradiction, or forging a fresh chain to
fetter your heart?”

“Don’t imagine such hard things. Fancy me yielding and melting, as I am
doing: human love rising like a freshly opened fountain in my mind and
overflowing with sweet inundation all the field I have so carefully and
with such labour prepared—so assiduously sown with the seeds of good
intentions, of self-denying plans. And now it is deluged with a
nectarous flood—the young germs swamped—delicious poison cankering
them: now I see myself stretched on an ottoman in the drawing-room at
Vale Hall at my bride Rosamond Oliver’s feet: she is talking to me with
her sweet voice—gazing down on me with those eyes your skilful hand has
copied so well—smiling at me with these coral lips. She is mine—I am
hers—this present life and passing world suffice to me. Hush! say
nothing—my heart is full of delight—my senses are entranced—let the
time I marked pass in peace.”

I humoured him: the watch ticked on: he breathed fast and low: I stood
silent. Amidst this hush the quartet sped; he replaced the watch, laid
the picture down, rose, and stood on the hearth.

“Now,” said he, “that little space was given to delirium and delusion.
I rested my temples on the breast of temptation, and put my neck
voluntarily under her yoke of flowers; I tasted her cup. The pillow was
burning: there is an asp in the garland: the wine has a bitter taste:
her promises are hollow—her offers false: I see and know all this.”

I gazed at him in wonder.

“It is strange,” pursued he, “that while I love Rosamond Oliver so
wildly—with all the intensity, indeed, of a first passion, the object
of which is exquisitely beautiful, graceful, fascinating—I experience
at the same time a calm, unwarped consciousness that she would not make
me a good wife; that she is not the partner suited to me; that I should
discover this within a year after marriage; and that to twelve months’
rapture would succeed a lifetime of regret. This I know.”

“Strange indeed!” I could not help ejaculating.

“While something in me,” he went on, “is acutely sensible to her
charms, something else is as deeply impressed with her defects: they
are such that she could sympathise in nothing I aspired to—co-operate
in nothing I undertook. Rosamond a sufferer, a labourer, a female
apostle? Rosamond a missionary’s wife? No!”

“But you need not be a missionary. You might relinquish that scheme.”

“Relinquish! What! my vocation? My great work? My foundation laid on
earth for a mansion in heaven? My hopes of being numbered in the band
who have merged all ambitions in the glorious one of bettering their
race—of carrying knowledge into the realms of ignorance—of substituting
peace for war—freedom for bondage—religion for superstition—the hope of
heaven for the fear of hell? Must I relinquish that? It is dearer than
the blood in my veins. It is what I have to look forward to, and to
live for.”

After a considerable pause, I said—“And Miss Oliver? Are her
disappointment and sorrow of no interest to you?”

“Miss Oliver is ever surrounded by suitors and flatterers: in less than
a month, my image will be effaced from her heart. She will forget me;
and will marry, probably, some one who will make her far happier than I
should do.”

“You speak coolly enough; but you suffer in the conflict. You are
wasting away.”

“No. If I get a little thin, it is with anxiety about my prospects, yet
unsettled—my departure, continually procrastinated. Only this morning,
I received intelligence that the successor, whose arrival I have been
so long expecting, cannot be ready to replace me for three months to
come yet; and perhaps the three months may extend to six.”

“You tremble and become flushed whenever Miss Oliver enters the
schoolroom.”

Again the surprised expression crossed his face. He had not imagined
that a woman would dare to speak so to a man. For me, I felt at home in
this sort of discourse. I could never rest in communication with
strong, discreet, and refined minds, whether male or female, till I had
passed the outworks of conventional reserve, and crossed the threshold
of confidence, and won a place by their heart’s very hearthstone.

“You _are_ original,” said he, “and not timid. There is something brave
in your spirit, as well as penetrating in your eye; but allow me to
assure you that you partially misinterpret my emotions. You think them
more profound and potent than they are. You give me a larger allowance
of sympathy than I have a just claim to. When I colour, and when I
shake before Miss Oliver, I do not pity myself. I scorn the weakness. I
know it is ignoble: a mere fever of the flesh: not, I declare, the
convulsion of the soul. _That_ is just as fixed as a rock, firm set in
the depths of a restless sea. Know me to be what I am—a cold hard man.”

I smiled incredulously.

“You have taken my confidence by storm,” he continued, “and now it is
much at your service. I am simply, in my original state—stripped of
that blood-bleached robe with which Christianity covers human
deformity—a cold, hard, ambitious man. Natural affection only, of all
the sentiments, has permanent power over me. Reason, and not feeling,
is my guide; my ambition is unlimited: my desire to rise higher, to do
more than others, insatiable. I honour endurance, perseverance,
industry, talent; because these are the means by which men achieve
great ends and mount to lofty eminence. I watch your career with
interest, because I consider you a specimen of a diligent, orderly,
energetic woman: not because I deeply compassionate what you have gone
through, or what you still suffer.”

“You would describe yourself as a mere pagan philosopher,” I said.

“No. There is this difference between me and deistic philosophers: I
believe; and I believe the Gospel. You missed your epithet. I am not a
pagan, but a Christian philosopher—a follower of the sect of Jesus. As
His disciple I adopt His pure, His merciful, His benignant doctrines. I
advocate them: I am sworn to spread them. Won in youth to religion, she
has cultivated my original qualities thus:—From the minute germ,
natural affection, she has developed the overshadowing tree,
philanthropy. From the wild stringy root of human uprightness, she has
reared a due sense of the Divine justice. Of the ambition to win power
and renown for my wretched self, she has formed the ambition to spread
my Master’s kingdom; to achieve victories for the standard of the
cross. So much has religion done for me; turning the original materials
to the best account; pruning and training nature. But she could not
eradicate nature: nor will it be eradicated ‘till this mortal shall put
on immortality.’”

Having said this, he took his hat, which lay on the table beside my
palette. Once more he looked at the portrait.

“She _is_ lovely,” he murmured. “She is well named the Rose of the
World, indeed!”

“And may I not paint one like it for you?”

“_Cui bono_? No.”

He drew over the picture the sheet of thin paper on which I was
accustomed to rest my hand in painting, to prevent the cardboard from
being sullied. What he suddenly saw on this blank paper, it was
impossible for me to tell; but something had caught his eye. He took it
up with a snatch; he looked at the edge; then shot a glance at me,
inexpressibly peculiar, and quite incomprehensible: a glance that
seemed to take and make note of every point in my shape, face, and
dress; for it traversed all, quick, keen as lightning. His lips parted,
as if to speak: but he checked the coming sentence, whatever it was.

“What is the matter?” I asked.

“Nothing in the world,” was the reply; and, replacing the paper, I saw
him dexterously tear a narrow slip from the margin. It disappeared in
his glove; and, with one hasty nod and “good-afternoon,” he vanished.

“Well!” I exclaimed, using an expression of the district, “that caps
the globe, however!”

I, in my turn, scrutinised the paper; but saw nothing on it save a few
dingy stains of paint where I had tried the tint in my pencil. I
pondered the mystery a minute or two; but finding it insolvable, and
being certain it could not be of much moment, I dismissed, and soon
forgot it.




CHAPTER XXXIII


When Mr. St. John went, it was beginning to snow; the whirling storm
continued all night. The next day a keen wind brought fresh and
blinding falls; by twilight the valley was drifted up and almost
impassable. I had closed my shutter, laid a mat to the door to prevent
the snow from blowing in under it, trimmed my fire, and after sitting
nearly an hour on the hearth listening to the muffled fury of the
tempest, I lit a candle, took down “Marmion,” and beginning—

“Day set on Norham’s castled steep,
And Tweed’s fair river broad and deep,
    And Cheviot’s mountains lone;
The massive towers, the donjon keep,
The flanking walls that round them sweep,
    In yellow lustre shone”—


I soon forgot storm in music.

I heard a noise: the wind, I thought, shook the door. No; it was St.
John Rivers, who, lifting the latch, came in out of the frozen
hurricane—the howling darkness—and stood before me: the cloak that
covered his tall figure all white as a glacier. I was almost in
consternation, so little had I expected any guest from the blocked-up
vale that night.

“Any ill news?” I demanded. “Has anything happened?”

“No. How very easily alarmed you are!” he answered, removing his cloak
and hanging it up against the door, towards which he again coolly
pushed the mat which his entrance had deranged. He stamped the snow
from his boots.

“I shall sully the purity of your floor,” said he, “but you must excuse
me for once.” Then he approached the fire. “I have had hard work to get
here, I assure you,” he observed, as he warmed his hands over the
flame. “One drift took me up to the waist; happily the snow is quite
soft yet.”

“But why are you come?” I could not forbear saying.

“Rather an inhospitable question to put to a visitor; but since you ask
it, I answer simply to have a little talk with you; I got tired of my
mute books and empty rooms. Besides, since yesterday I have experienced
the excitement of a person to whom a tale has been half-told, and who
is impatient to hear the sequel.”

He sat down. I recalled his singular conduct of yesterday, and really I
began to fear his wits were touched. If he were insane, however, his
was a very cool and collected insanity: I had never seen that
handsome-featured face of his look more like chiselled marble than it
did just now, as he put aside his snow-wet hair from his forehead and
let the firelight shine free on his pale brow and cheek as pale, where
it grieved me to discover the hollow trace of care or sorrow now so
plainly graved. I waited, expecting he would say something I could at
least comprehend; but his hand was now at his chin, his finger on his
lip: he was thinking. It struck me that his hand looked wasted like his
face. A perhaps uncalled-for gush of pity came over my heart: I was
moved to say—

“I wish Diana or Mary would come and live with you: it is too bad that
you should be quite alone; and you are recklessly rash about your own
health.”

“Not at all,” said he: “I care for myself when necessary. I am well
now. What do you see amiss in me?”

This was said with a careless, abstracted indifference, which showed
that my solicitude was, at least in his opinion, wholly superfluous. I
was silenced.

He still slowly moved his finger over his upper lip, and still his eye
dwelt dreamily on the glowing grate; thinking it urgent to say
something, I asked him presently if he felt any cold draught from the
door, which was behind him.

“No, no!” he responded shortly and somewhat testily.

“Well,” I reflected, “if you won’t talk, you may be still; I’ll let you
alone now, and return to my book.”

So I snuffed the candle and resumed the perusal of “Marmion.” He soon
stirred; my eye was instantly drawn to his movements; he only took out
a morocco pocket-book, thence produced a letter, which he read in
silence, folded it, put it back, relapsed into meditation. It was vain
to try to read with such an inscrutable fixture before me; nor could I,
in impatience, consent to be dumb; he might rebuff me if he liked, but
talk I would.

“Have you heard from Diana and Mary lately?”

“Not since the letter I showed you a week ago.”

“There has not been any change made about your own arrangements? You
will not be summoned to leave England sooner than you expected?”

“I fear not, indeed: such chance is too good to befall me.” Baffled so
far, I changed my ground. I bethought myself to talk about the school
and my scholars.

“Mary Garrett’s mother is better, and Mary came back to the school this
morning, and I shall have four new girls next week from the Foundry
Close—they would have come to-day but for the snow.”

“Indeed!”

“Mr. Oliver pays for two.”

“Does he?”

“He means to give the whole school a treat at Christmas.”

“I know.”

“Was it your suggestion?”

“No.”

“Whose, then?”

“His daughter’s, I think.”

“It is like her: she is so good-natured.”

“Yes.”

Again came the blank of a pause: the clock struck eight strokes. It
aroused him; he uncrossed his legs, sat erect, turned to me.

“Leave your book a moment, and come a little nearer the fire,” he said.

Wondering, and of my wonder finding no end, I complied.

“Half-an-hour ago,” he pursued, “I spoke of my impatience to hear the
sequel of a tale: on reflection, I find the matter will be better
managed by my assuming the narrator’s part, and converting you into a
listener. Before commencing, it is but fair to warn you that the story
will sound somewhat hackneyed in your ears; but stale details often
regain a degree of freshness when they pass through new lips. For the
rest, whether trite or novel, it is short.

“Twenty years ago, a poor curate—never mind his name at this
moment—fell in love with a rich man’s daughter; she fell in love with
him, and married him, against the advice of all her friends, who
consequently disowned her immediately after the wedding. Before two
years passed, the rash pair were both dead, and laid quietly side by
side under one slab. (I have seen their grave; it formed part of the
pavement of a huge churchyard surrounding the grim, soot-black old
cathedral of an overgrown manufacturing town in ——shire.) They left a
daughter, which, at its very birth, Charity received in her lap—cold as
that of the snow-drift I almost stuck fast in to-night. Charity carried
the friendless thing to the house of its rich maternal relations; it
was reared by an aunt-in-law, called (I come to names now) Mrs. Reed of
Gateshead. You start—did you hear a noise? I daresay it is only a rat
scrambling along the rafters of the adjoining schoolroom: it was a barn
before I had it repaired and altered, and barns are generally haunted
by rats.—To proceed. Mrs. Reed kept the orphan ten years: whether it
was happy or not with her, I cannot say, never having been told; but at
the end of that time she transferred it to a place you know—being no
other than Lowood School, where you so long resided yourself. It seems
her career there was very honourable: from a pupil, she became a
teacher, like yourself—really it strikes me there are parallel points
in her history and yours—she left it to be a governess: there, again,
your fates were analogous; she undertook the education of the ward of a
certain Mr. Rochester.”

“Mr. Rivers!” I interrupted.

“I can guess your feelings,” he said, “but restrain them for a while: I
have nearly finished; hear me to the end. Of Mr. Rochester’s character
I know nothing, but the one fact that he professed to offer honourable
marriage to this young girl, and that at the very altar she discovered
he had a wife yet alive, though a lunatic. What his subsequent conduct
and proposals were is a matter of pure conjecture; but when an event
transpired which rendered inquiry after the governess necessary, it was
discovered she was gone—no one could tell when, where, or how. She had
left Thornfield Hall in the night; every research after her course had
been vain: the country had been scoured far and wide; no vestige of
information could be gathered respecting her. Yet that she should be
found is become a matter of serious urgency: advertisements have been
put in all the papers; I myself have received a letter from one Mr.
Briggs, a solicitor, communicating the details I have just imparted. Is
it not an odd tale?”

“Just tell me this,” said I, “and since you know so much, you surely
_can_ tell it me—what of Mr. Rochester? How and where is he? What is he
doing? Is he well?”

“I am ignorant of all concerning Mr. Rochester: the letter never
mentions him but to narrate the fraudulent and illegal attempt I have
adverted to. You should rather ask the name of the governess—the nature
of the event which requires her appearance.”

“Did no one go to Thornfield Hall, then? Did no one see Mr. Rochester?”

“I suppose not.”

“But they wrote to him?”

“Of course.”

“And what did he say? Who has his letters?”

“Mr. Briggs intimates that the answer to his application was not from
Mr. Rochester, but from a lady: it is signed ‘Alice Fairfax.’”

I felt cold and dismayed: my worst fears then were probably true: he
had in all probability left England and rushed in reckless desperation
to some former haunt on the Continent. And what opiate for his severe
sufferings—what object for his strong passions—had he sought there? I
dared not answer the question. Oh, my poor master—once almost my
husband—whom I had often called “my dear Edward!”

“He must have been a bad man,” observed Mr. Rivers.

“You don’t know him—don’t pronounce an opinion upon him,” I said, with
warmth.

“Very well,” he answered quietly: “and indeed my head is otherwise
occupied than with him: I have my tale to finish. Since you won’t ask
the governess’s name, I must tell it of my own accord. Stay! I have it
here—it is always more satisfactory to see important points written
down, fairly committed to black and white.”

And the pocket-book was again deliberately produced, opened, sought
through; from one of its compartments was extracted a shabby slip of
paper, hastily torn off: I recognised in its texture and its stains of
ultra-marine, and lake, and vermillion, the ravished margin of the
portrait-cover. He got up, held it close to my eyes: and I read, traced
in Indian ink, in my own handwriting, the words “JANE EYRE”—the work
doubtless of some moment of abstraction.

“Briggs wrote to me of a Jane Eyre:” he said, “the advertisements
demanded a Jane Eyre: I knew a Jane Elliott.—I confess I had my
suspicions, but it was only yesterday afternoon they were at once
resolved into certainty. You own the name and renounce the _alias_?”

“Yes—yes; but where is Mr. Briggs? He perhaps knows more of Mr.
Rochester than you do.”

“Briggs is in London. I should doubt his knowing anything at all about
Mr. Rochester; it is not in Mr. Rochester he is interested. Meantime,
you forget essential points in pursuing trifles: you do not inquire why
Mr. Briggs sought after you—what he wanted with you.”

“Well, what did he want?”

“Merely to tell you that your uncle, Mr. Eyre of Madeira, is dead; that
he has left you all his property, and that you are now rich—merely
that—nothing more.”

“I!—rich?”

“Yes, you, rich—quite an heiress.”

Silence succeeded.

“You must prove your identity of course,” resumed St. John presently:
“a step which will offer no difficulties; you can then enter on
immediate possession. Your fortune is vested in the English funds;
Briggs has the will and the necessary documents.”

Here was a new card turned up! It is a fine thing, reader, to be lifted
in a moment from indigence to wealth—a very fine thing; but not a
matter one can comprehend, or consequently enjoy, all at once. And then
there are other chances in life far more thrilling and rapture-giving:
_this_ is solid, an affair of the actual world, nothing ideal about it:
all its associations are solid and sober, and its manifestations are
the same. One does not jump, and spring, and shout hurrah! at hearing
one has got a fortune; one begins to consider responsibilities, and to
ponder business; on a base of steady satisfaction rise certain grave
cares, and we contain ourselves, and brood over our bliss with a solemn
brow.

Besides, the words Legacy, Bequest, go side by side with the words,
Death, Funeral. My uncle I had heard was dead—my only relative; ever
since being made aware of his existence, I had cherished the hope of
one day seeing him: now, I never should. And then this money came only
to me: not to me and a rejoicing family, but to my isolated self. It
was a grand boon doubtless; and independence would be glorious—yes, I
felt that—_that_ thought swelled my heart.

“You unbend your forehead at last,” said Mr. Rivers. “I thought Medusa
had looked at you, and that you were turning to stone. Perhaps now you
will ask how much you are worth?”

“How much am I worth?”

“Oh, a trifle! Nothing of course to speak of—twenty thousand pounds, I
think they say—but what is that?”

“Twenty thousand pounds?”

Here was a new stunner—I had been calculating on four or five thousand.
This news actually took my breath for a moment: Mr. St. John, whom I
had never heard laugh before, laughed now.

“Well,” said he, “if you had committed a murder, and I had told you
your crime was discovered, you could scarcely look more aghast.”

“It is a large sum—don’t you think there is a mistake?”

“No mistake at all.”

“Perhaps you have read the figures wrong—it may be two thousand!”

“It is written in letters, not figures,—twenty thousand.”

I again felt rather like an individual of but average gastronomical
powers sitting down to feast alone at a table spread with provisions
for a hundred. Mr. Rivers rose now and put his cloak on.

“If it were not such a very wild night,” he said, “I would send Hannah
down to keep you company: you look too desperately miserable to be left
alone. But Hannah, poor woman! could not stride the drifts so well as
I: her legs are not quite so long: so I must e’en leave you to your
sorrows. Good-night.”

He was lifting the latch: a sudden thought occurred to me.

“Stop one minute!” I cried.

“Well?”

“It puzzles me to know why Mr. Briggs wrote to you about me; or how he
knew you, or could fancy that you, living in such an out-of-the-way
place, had the power to aid in my discovery.”

“Oh! I am a clergyman,” he said; “and the clergy are often appealed to
about odd matters.” Again the latch rattled.

“No; that does not satisfy me!” I exclaimed: and indeed there was
something in the hasty and unexplanatory reply which, instead of
allaying, piqued my curiosity more than ever.

“It is a very strange piece of business,” I added; “I must know more
about it.”

“Another time.”

“No; to-night!—to-night!” and as he turned from the door, I placed
myself between it and him. He looked rather embarrassed.

“You certainly shall not go till you have told me all,” I said.

“I would rather not just now.”

“You shall!—you must!”

“I would rather Diana or Mary informed you.”

Of course these objections wrought my eagerness to a climax: gratified
it must be, and that without delay; and I told him so.

“But I apprised you that I was a hard man,” said he, “difficult to
persuade.”

“And I am a hard woman,—impossible to put off.”


And I am a hard woman,—impossible to put off

“And then,” he pursued, “I am cold: no fervour infects me.”

“Whereas I am hot, and fire dissolves ice. The blaze there has thawed
all the snow from your cloak; by the same token, it has streamed on to
my floor, and made it like a trampled street. As you hope ever to be
forgiven, Mr. Rivers, the high crime and misdemeanour of spoiling a
sanded kitchen, tell me what I wish to know.”

“Well, then,” he said, “I yield; if not to your earnestness, to your
perseverance: as stone is worn by continual dropping. Besides, you must
know some day,—as well now as later. Your name is Jane Eyre?”

“Of course: that was all settled before.”

“You are not, perhaps, aware that I am your namesake?—that I was
christened St. John Eyre Rivers?”

“No, indeed! I remember now seeing the letter E. comprised in your
initials written in books you have at different times lent me; but I
never asked for what name it stood. But what then? Surely—”

I stopped: I could not trust myself to entertain, much less to express,
the thought that rushed upon me—that embodied itself,—that, in a
second, stood out a strong, solid probability. Circumstances knit
themselves, fitted themselves, shot into order: the chain that had been
lying hitherto a formless lump of links was drawn out straight,—every
ring was perfect, the connection complete. I knew, by instinct, how the
matter stood, before St. John had said another word; but I cannot
expect the reader to have the same intuitive perception, so I must
repeat his explanation.

“My mother’s name was Eyre; she had two brothers; one a clergyman, who
married Miss Jane Reed, of Gateshead; the other, John Eyre, Esq.,
merchant, late of Funchal, Madeira. Mr. Briggs, being Mr. Eyre’s
solicitor, wrote to us last August to inform us of our uncle’s death,
and to say that he had left his property to his brother the clergyman’s
orphan daughter, overlooking us, in consequence of a quarrel, never
forgiven, between him and my father. He wrote again a few weeks since,
to intimate that the heiress was lost, and asking if we knew anything
of her. A name casually written on a slip of paper has enabled me to
find her out. You know the rest.” Again he was going, but I set my back
against the door.

“Do let me speak,” I said; “let me have one moment to draw breath and
reflect.” I paused—he stood before me, hat in hand, looking composed
enough. I resumed—

“Your mother was my father’s sister?”

“Yes.”

“My aunt, consequently?”

He bowed.

“My uncle John was your uncle John? You, Diana, and Mary are his
sister’s children, as I am his brother’s child?”

“Undeniably.”

“You three, then, are my cousins; half our blood on each side flows
from the same source?”

“We are cousins; yes.”

I surveyed him. It seemed I had found a brother: one I could be proud
of,—one I could love; and two sisters, whose qualities were such, that,
when I knew them but as mere strangers, they had inspired me with
genuine affection and admiration. The two girls, on whom, kneeling down
on the wet ground, and looking through the low, latticed window of Moor
House kitchen, I had gazed with so bitter a mixture of interest and
despair, were my near kinswomen; and the young and stately gentleman
who had found me almost dying at his threshold was my blood relation.
Glorious discovery to a lonely wretch! This was wealth indeed!—wealth
to the heart!—a mine of pure, genial affections. This was a blessing,
bright, vivid, and exhilarating;—not like the ponderous gift of gold:
rich and welcome enough in its way, but sobering from its weight. I now
clapped my hands in sudden joy—my pulse bounded, my veins thrilled.

“Oh, I am glad!—I am glad!” I exclaimed.

St. John smiled. “Did I not say you neglected essential points to
pursue trifles?” he asked. “You were serious when I told you you had
got a fortune; and now, for a matter of no moment, you are excited.”

“What _can_ you mean? It may be of no moment to you; you have sisters
and don’t care for a cousin; but I had nobody; and now three
relations,—or two, if you don’t choose to be counted,—are born into my
world full-grown. I say again, I am glad!”

I walked fast through the room: I stopped, half suffocated with the
thoughts that rose faster than I could receive, comprehend, settle
them:—thoughts of what might, could, would, and should be, and that ere
long. I looked at the blank wall: it seemed a sky thick with ascending
stars,—every one lit me to a purpose or delight. Those who had saved my
life, whom, till this hour, I had loved barrenly, I could now benefit.
They were under a yoke,—I could free them: they were scattered,—I could
reunite them: the independence, the affluence which was mine, might be
theirs too. Were we not four? Twenty thousand pounds shared equally
would be five thousand each, justice—enough and to spare: justice would
be done,—mutual happiness secured. Now the wealth did not weigh on me:
now it was not a mere bequest of coin,—it was a legacy of life, hope,
enjoyment.

How I looked while these ideas were taking my spirit by storm, I cannot
tell; but I perceived soon that Mr. Rivers had placed a chair behind
me, and was gently attempting to make me sit down on it. He also
advised me to be composed; I scorned the insinuation of helplessness
and distraction, shook off his hand, and began to walk about again.

“Write to Diana and Mary to-morrow,” I said, “and tell them to come
home directly. Diana said they would both consider themselves rich with
a thousand pounds, so with five thousand they will do very well.”

“Tell me where I can get you a glass of water,” said St. John; “you
must really make an effort to tranquillise your feelings.”

“Nonsense! and what sort of an effect will the bequest have on you?
Will it keep you in England, induce you to marry Miss Oliver, and
settle down like an ordinary mortal?”

“You wander: your head becomes confused. I have been too abrupt in
communicating the news; it has excited you beyond your strength.”

“Mr. Rivers! you quite put me out of patience: I am rational enough; it
is you who misunderstand, or rather who affect to misunderstand.”

“Perhaps, if you explained yourself a little more fully, I should
comprehend better.”

“Explain! What is there to explain? You cannot fail to see that twenty
thousand pounds, the sum in question, divided equally between the
nephew and three nieces of our uncle, will give five thousand to each?
What I want is, that you should write to your sisters and tell them of
the fortune that has accrued to them.”

“To you, you mean.”

“I have intimated my view of the case: I am incapable of taking any
other. I am not brutally selfish, blindly unjust, or fiendishly
ungrateful. Besides, I am resolved I will have a home and connections.
I like Moor House, and I will live at Moor House; I like Diana and
Mary, and I will attach myself for life to Diana and Mary. It would
please and benefit me to have five thousand pounds; it would torment
and oppress me to have twenty thousand; which, moreover, could never be
mine in justice, though it might in law. I abandon to you, then, what
is absolutely superfluous to me. Let there be no opposition, and no
discussion about it; let us agree amongst each other, and decide the
point at once.”

“This is acting on first impulses; you must take days to consider such
a matter, ere your word can be regarded as valid.”

“Oh! if all you doubt is my sincerity, I am easy: you see the justice
of the case?”

“I _do_ see a certain justice; but it is contrary to all custom.
Besides, the entire fortune is your right: my uncle gained it by his
own efforts; he was free to leave it to whom he would: he left it to
you. After all, justice permits you to keep it: you may, with a clear
conscience, consider it absolutely your own.”

“With me,” said I, “it is fully as much a matter of feeling as of
conscience: I must indulge my feelings; I so seldom have had an
opportunity of doing so. Were you to argue, object, and annoy me for a
year, I could not forego the delicious pleasure of which I have caught
a glimpse—that of repaying, in part, a mighty obligation, and winning
to myself lifelong friends.”

“You think so now,” rejoined St. John, “because you do not know what it
is to possess, nor consequently to enjoy wealth: you cannot form a
notion of the importance twenty thousand pounds would give you; of the
place it would enable you to take in society; of the prospects it would
open to you: you cannot—”

“And you,” I interrupted, “cannot at all imagine the craving I have for
fraternal and sisterly love. I never had a home, I never had brothers
or sisters; I must and will have them now: you are not reluctant to
admit me and own me, are you?”

“Jane, I will be your brother—my sisters will be your sisters—without
stipulating for this sacrifice of your just rights.”

“Brother? Yes; at the distance of a thousand leagues! Sisters? Yes;
slaving amongst strangers! I, wealthy—gorged with gold I never earned
and do not merit! You, penniless! Famous equality and fraternisation!
Close union! Intimate attachment!”

“But, Jane, your aspirations after family ties and domestic happiness
may be realised otherwise than by the means you contemplate: you may
marry.”

“Nonsense, again! Marry! I don’t want to marry, and never shall marry.”

“That is saying too much: such hazardous affirmations are a proof of
the excitement under which you labour.”

“It is not saying too much: I know what I feel, and how averse are my
inclinations to the bare thought of marriage. No one would take me for
love; and I will not be regarded in the light of a mere money
speculation. And I do not want a stranger—unsympathising, alien,
different from me; I want my kindred: those with whom I have full
fellow-feeling. Say again you will be my brother: when you uttered the
words I was satisfied, happy; repeat them, if you can, repeat them
sincerely.”

“I think I can. I know I have always loved my own sisters; and I know
on what my affection for them is grounded,—respect for their worth and
admiration of their talents. You too have principle and mind: your
tastes and habits resemble Diana’s and Mary’s; your presence is always
agreeable to me; in your conversation I have already for some time
found a salutary solace. I feel I can easily and naturally make room in
my heart for you, as my third and youngest sister.”

“Thank you: that contents me for to-night. Now you had better go; for
if you stay longer, you will perhaps irritate me afresh by some
mistrustful scruple.”

“And the school, Miss Eyre? It must now be shut up, I suppose?”

“No. I will retain my post of mistress till you get a substitute.”

He smiled approbation: we shook hands, and he took leave.

I need not narrate in detail the further struggles I had, and arguments
I used, to get matters regarding the legacy settled as I wished. My
task was a very hard one; but, as I was absolutely resolved—as my
cousins saw at length that my mind was really and immutably fixed on
making a just division of the property—as they must in their own hearts
have felt the equity of the intention; and must, besides, have been
innately conscious that in my place they would have done precisely what
I wished to do—they yielded at length so far as to consent to put the
affair to arbitration. The judges chosen were Mr. Oliver and an able
lawyer: both coincided in my opinion: I carried my point. The
instruments of transfer were drawn out: St. John, Diana, Mary, and I,
each became possessed of a competency.




CHAPTER XXXIV


It was near Christmas by the time all was settled: the season of
general holiday approached. I now closed Morton school, taking care
that the parting should not be barren on my side. Good fortune opens
the hand as well as the heart wonderfully; and to give somewhat when we
have largely received, is but to afford a vent to the unusual
ebullition of the sensations. I had long felt with pleasure that many
of my rustic scholars liked me, and when we parted, that consciousness
was confirmed: they manifested their affection plainly and strongly.
Deep was my gratification to find I had really a place in their
unsophisticated hearts: I promised them that never a week should pass
in future that I did not visit them, and give them an hour’s teaching
in their school.

Mr. Rivers came up as, having seen the classes, now numbering sixty
girls, file out before me, and locked the door, I stood with the key in
my hand, exchanging a few words of special farewell with some
half-dozen of my best scholars: as decent, respectable, modest, and
well-informed young women as could be found in the ranks of the British
peasantry. And that is saying a great deal; for after all, the British
peasantry are the best taught, best mannered, most self-respecting of
any in Europe: since those days I have seen paysannes and Bäuerinnen;
and the best of them seemed to me ignorant, coarse, and besotted,
compared with my Morton girls.

“Do you consider you have got your reward for a season of exertion?”
asked Mr. Rivers, when they were gone. “Does not the consciousness of
having done some real good in your day and generation give pleasure?”

“Doubtless.”

“And you have only toiled a few months! Would not a life devoted to the
task of regenerating your race be well spent?”

“Yes,” I said; “but I could not go on for ever so: I want to enjoy my
own faculties as well as to cultivate those of other people. I must
enjoy them now; don’t recall either my mind or body to the school; I am
out of it and disposed for full holiday.”

He looked grave. “What now? What sudden eagerness is this you evince?
What are you going to do?”

“To be active: as active as I can. And first I must beg you to set
Hannah at liberty, and get somebody else to wait on you.”

“Do you want her?”

“Yes, to go with me to Moor House. Diana and Mary will be at home in a
week, and I want to have everything in order against their arrival.”

“I understand. I thought you were for flying off on some excursion. It
is better so: Hannah shall go with you.”

“Tell her to be ready by to-morrow then; and here is the schoolroom
key: I will give you the key of my cottage in the morning.”

He took it. “You give it up very gleefully,” said he; “I don’t quite
understand your light-heartedness, because I cannot tell what
employment you propose to yourself as a substitute for the one you are
relinquishing. What aim, what purpose, what ambition in life have you
now?”

“My first aim will be to _clean down_ (do you comprehend the full force
of the expression?)—to _clean down_ Moor House from chamber to cellar;
my next to rub it up with bees-wax, oil, and an indefinite number of
cloths, till it glitters again; my third, to arrange every chair,
table, bed, carpet, with mathematical precision; afterwards I shall go
near to ruin you in coals and peat to keep up good fires in every room;
and lastly, the two days preceding that on which your sisters are
expected will be devoted by Hannah and me to such a beating of eggs,
sorting of currants, grating of spices, compounding of Christmas cakes,
chopping up of materials for mince-pies, and solemnising of other
culinary rites, as words can convey but an inadequate notion of to the
uninitiated like you. My purpose, in short, is to have all things in an
absolutely perfect state of readiness for Diana and Mary before next
Thursday; and my ambition is to give them a beau-ideal of a welcome
when they come.”

St. John smiled slightly: still he was dissatisfied.

“It is all very well for the present,” said he; “but seriously, I trust
that when the first flush of vivacity is over, you will look a little
higher than domestic endearments and household joys.”

“The best things the world has!” I interrupted.

“No, Jane, no: this world is not the scene of fruition; do not attempt
to make it so: nor of rest; do not turn slothful.”

“I mean, on the contrary, to be busy.”

“Jane, I excuse you for the present: two months’ grace I allow you for
the full enjoyment of your new position, and for pleasing yourself with
this late-found charm of relationship; but _then_, I hope you will
begin to look beyond Moor House and Morton, and sisterly society, and
the selfish calm and sensual comfort of civilised affluence. I hope
your energies will then once more trouble you with their strength.”

I looked at him with surprise. “St. John,” I said, “I think you are
almost wicked to talk so. I am disposed to be as content as a queen,
and you try to stir me up to restlessness! To what end?”

“To the end of turning to profit the talents which God has committed to
your keeping; and of which He will surely one day demand a strict
account. Jane, I shall watch you closely and anxiously—I warn you of
that. And try to restrain the disproportionate fervour with which you
throw yourself into commonplace home pleasures. Don’t cling so
tenaciously to ties of the flesh; save your constancy and ardour for an
adequate cause; forbear to waste them on trite transient objects. Do
you hear, Jane?”

“Yes; just as if you were speaking Greek. I feel I have adequate cause
to be happy, and I _will_ be happy. Goodbye!”

Happy at Moor House I was, and hard I worked; and so did Hannah: she
was charmed to see how jovial I could be amidst the bustle of a house
turned topsy-turvy—how I could brush, and dust, and clean, and cook.
And really, after a day or two of confusion worse confounded, it was
delightful by degrees to invoke order from the chaos ourselves had
made. I had previously taken a journey to S—— to purchase some new
furniture: my cousins having given me _carte blanche_ to effect what
alterations I pleased, and a sum having been set aside for that
purpose. The ordinary sitting-room and bedrooms I left much as they
were: for I knew Diana and Mary would derive more pleasure from seeing
again the old homely tables, and chairs, and beds, than from the
spectacle of the smartest innovations. Still some novelty was
necessary, to give to their return the piquancy with which I wished it
to be invested. Dark handsome new carpets and curtains, an arrangement
of some carefully selected antique ornaments in porcelain and bronze,
new coverings, and mirrors, and dressing-cases, for the toilet tables,
answered the end: they looked fresh without being glaring. A spare
parlour and bedroom I refurnished entirely, with old mahogany and
crimson upholstery: I laid canvas on the passage, and carpets on the
stairs. When all was finished, I thought Moor House as complete a model
of bright modest snugness within, as it was, at this season, a specimen
of wintry waste and desert dreariness without.

The eventful Thursday at length came. They were expected about dark,
and ere dusk fires were lit upstairs and below; the kitchen was in
perfect trim; Hannah and I were dressed, and all was in readiness.

St. John arrived first. I had entreated him to keep quite clear of the
house till everything was arranged: and, indeed, the bare idea of the
commotion, at once sordid and trivial, going on within its walls
sufficed to scare him to estrangement. He found me in the kitchen,
watching the progress of certain cakes for tea, then baking.
Approaching the hearth, he asked, “If I was at last satisfied with
housemaid’s work?” I answered by inviting him to accompany me on a
general inspection of the result of my labours. With some difficulty, I
got him to make the tour of the house. He just looked in at the doors I
opened; and when he had wandered upstairs and downstairs, he said I
must have gone through a great deal of fatigue and trouble to have
effected such considerable changes in so short a time: but not a
syllable did he utter indicating pleasure in the improved aspect of his
abode.

This silence damped me. I thought perhaps the alterations had disturbed
some old associations he valued. I inquired whether this was the case:
no doubt in a somewhat crest-fallen tone.

“Not at all; he had, on the contrary, remarked that I had scrupulously
respected every association: he feared, indeed, I must have bestowed
more thought on the matter than it was worth. How many minutes, for
instance, had I devoted to studying the arrangement of this very
room?—By-the-bye, could I tell him where such a book was?”

I showed him the volume on the shelf: he took it down, and withdrawing
to his accustomed window recess, he began to read it.

Now, I did not like this, reader. St. John was a good man; but I began
to feel he had spoken truth of himself when he said he was hard and
cold. The humanities and amenities of life had no attraction for
him—its peaceful enjoyments no charm. Literally, he lived only to
aspire—after what was good and great, certainly; but still he would
never rest, nor approve of others resting round him. As I looked at his
lofty forehead, still and pale as a white stone—at his fine lineaments
fixed in study—I comprehended all at once that he would hardly make a
good husband: that it would be a trying thing to be his wife. I
understood, as by inspiration, the nature of his love for Miss Oliver;
I agreed with him that it was but a love of the senses. I comprehended
how he should despise himself for the feverish influence it exercised
over him; how he should wish to stifle and destroy it; how he should
mistrust its ever conducting permanently to his happiness or hers. I
saw he was of the material from which nature hews her heroes—Christian
and Pagan—her lawgivers, her statesmen, her conquerors: a steadfast
bulwark for great interests to rest upon; but, at the fireside, too
often a cold cumbrous column, gloomy and out of place.

“This parlour is not his sphere,” I reflected: “the Himalayan ridge or
Caffre bush, even the plague-cursed Guinea Coast swamp would suit him
better. Well may he eschew the calm of domestic life; it is not his
element: there his faculties stagnate—they cannot develop or appear to
advantage. It is in scenes of strife and danger—where courage is
proved, and energy exercised, and fortitude tasked—that he will speak
and move, the leader and superior. A merry child would have the
advantage of him on this hearth. He is right to choose a missionary’s
career—I see it now.”

“They are coming! they are coming!” cried Hannah, throwing open the
parlour door. At the same moment old Carlo barked joyfully. Out I ran.
It was now dark; but a rumbling of wheels was audible. Hannah soon had
a lantern lit. The vehicle had stopped at the wicket; the driver opened
the door: first one well-known form, then another, stepped out. In a
minute I had my face under their bonnets, in contact first with Mary’s
soft cheek, then with Diana’s flowing curls. They laughed—kissed
me—then Hannah: patted Carlo, who was half wild with delight; asked
eagerly if all was well; and being assured in the affirmative, hastened
into the house.

They were stiff with their long and jolting drive from Whitcross, and
chilled with the frosty night air; but their pleasant countenances
expanded to the cheerful firelight. While the driver and Hannah brought
in the boxes, they demanded St. John. At this moment he advanced from
the parlour. They both threw their arms round his neck at once. He gave
each one quiet kiss, said in a low tone a few words of welcome, stood a
while to be talked to, and then, intimating that he supposed they would
soon rejoin him in the parlour, withdrew there as to a place of refuge.

I had lit their candles to go upstairs, but Diana had first to give
hospitable orders respecting the driver; this done, both followed me.
They were delighted with the renovation and decorations of their rooms;
with the new drapery, and fresh carpets, and rich tinted china vases:
they expressed their gratification ungrudgingly. I had the pleasure of
feeling that my arrangements met their wishes exactly, and that what I
had done added a vivid charm to their joyous return home.

Sweet was that evening. My cousins, full of exhilaration, were so
eloquent in narrative and comment, that their fluency covered St.
John’s taciturnity: he was sincerely glad to see his sisters; but in
their glow of fervour and flow of joy he could not sympathise. The
event of the day—that is, the return of Diana and Mary—pleased him; but
the accompaniments of that event, the glad tumult, the garrulous glee
of reception irked him: I saw he wished the calmer morrow was come. In
the very meridian of the night’s enjoyment, about an hour after tea, a
rap was heard at the door. Hannah entered with the intimation that “a
poor lad was come, at that unlikely time, to fetch Mr. Rivers to see
his mother, who was drawing away.”

“Where does she live, Hannah?”

“Clear up at Whitcross Brow, almost four miles off, and moor and moss
all the way.”

“Tell him I will go.”

“I’m sure, sir, you had better not. It’s the worst road to travel after
dark that can be: there’s no track at all over the bog. And then it is
such a bitter night—the keenest wind you ever felt. You had better send
word, sir, that you will be there in the morning.”

But he was already in the passage, putting on his cloak; and without
one objection, one murmur, he departed. It was then nine o’clock: he
did not return till midnight. Starved and tired enough he was: but he
looked happier than when he set out. He had performed an act of duty;
made an exertion; felt his own strength to do and deny, and was on
better terms with himself.

I am afraid the whole of the ensuing week tried his patience. It was
Christmas week: we took to no settled employment, but spent it in a
sort of merry domestic dissipation. The air of the moors, the freedom
of home, the dawn of prosperity, acted on Diana and Mary’s spirits like
some life-giving elixir: they were gay from morning till noon, and from
noon till night. They could always talk; and their discourse, witty,
pithy, original, had such charms for me, that I preferred listening to,
and sharing in it, to doing anything else. St. John did not rebuke our
vivacity; but he escaped from it: he was seldom in the house; his
parish was large, the population scattered, and he found daily business
in visiting the sick and poor in its different districts.

One morning at breakfast, Diana, after looking a little pensive for
some minutes, asked him, “If his plans were yet unchanged.”

“Unchanged and unchangeable,” was the reply. And he proceeded to inform
us that his departure from England was now definitively fixed for the
ensuing year.

“And Rosamond Oliver?” suggested Mary, the words seeming to escape her
lips involuntarily: for no sooner had she uttered them, than she made a
gesture as if wishing to recall them. St. John had a book in his
hand—it was his unsocial custom to read at meals—he closed it, and
looked up.

“Rosamond Oliver,” said he, “is about to be married to Mr. Granby, one
of the best connected and most estimable residents in S——, grandson and
heir to Sir Frederic Granby: I had the intelligence from her father
yesterday.”

His sisters looked at each other and at me; we all three looked at him:
he was serene as glass.

“The match must have been got up hastily,” said Diana: “they cannot
have known each other long.”

“But two months: they met in October at the county ball at S——. But
where there are no obstacles to a union, as in the present case, where
the connection is in every point desirable, delays are unnecessary:
they will be married as soon as S—— Place, which Sir Frederic gives up
to them, can be refitted for their reception.”

The first time I found St. John alone after this communication, I felt
tempted to inquire if the event distressed him: but he seemed so little
to need sympathy, that, so far from venturing to offer him more, I
experienced some shame at the recollection of what I had already
hazarded. Besides, I was out of practice in talking to him: his reserve
was again frozen over, and my frankness was congealed beneath it. He
had not kept his promise of treating me like his sisters; he
continually made little chilling differences between us, which did not
at all tend to the development of cordiality: in short, now that I was
acknowledged his kinswoman, and lived under the same roof with him, I
felt the distance between us to be far greater than when he had known
me only as the village schoolmistress. When I remembered how far I had
once been admitted to his confidence, I could hardly comprehend his
present frigidity.

Such being the case, I felt not a little surprised when he raised his
head suddenly from the desk over which he was stooping, and said—

“You see, Jane, the battle is fought and the victory won.”

Startled at being thus addressed, I did not immediately reply: after a
moment’s hesitation I answered—

“But are you sure you are not in the position of those conquerors whose
triumphs have cost them too dear? Would not such another ruin you?”

“I think not; and if I were, it does not much signify; I shall never be
called upon to contend for such another. The event of the conflict is
decisive: my way is now clear; I thank God for it!” So saying, he
returned to his papers and his silence.

As our mutual happiness (_i.e._, Diana’s, Mary’s, and mine) settled
into a quieter character, and we resumed our usual habits and regular
studies, St. John stayed more at home: he sat with us in the same room,
sometimes for hours together. While Mary drew, Diana pursued a course
of encyclopædic reading she had (to my awe and amazement) undertaken,
and I fagged away at German, he pondered a mystic lore of his own: that
of some Eastern tongue, the acquisition of which he thought necessary
to his plans.

Thus engaged, he appeared, sitting in his own recess, quiet and
absorbed enough; but that blue eye of his had a habit of leaving the
outlandish-looking grammar, and wandering over, and sometimes fixing
upon us, his fellow-students, with a curious intensity of observation:
if caught, it would be instantly withdrawn; yet ever and anon, it
returned searchingly to our table. I wondered what it meant: I
wondered, too, at the punctual satisfaction he never failed to exhibit
on an occasion that seemed to me of small moment, namely, my weekly
visit to Morton school; and still more was I puzzled when, if the day
was unfavourable, if there was snow, or rain, or high wind, and his
sisters urged me not to go, he would invariably make light of their
solicitude, and encourage me to accomplish the task without regard to
the elements.

“Jane is not such a weakling as you would make her,” he would say: “she
can bear a mountain blast, or a shower, or a few flakes of snow, as
well as any of us. Her constitution is both sound and elastic;—better
calculated to endure variations of climate than many more robust.”

And when I returned, sometimes a good deal tired, and not a little
weather-beaten, I never dared complain, because I saw that to murmur
would be to vex him: on all occasions fortitude pleased him; the
reverse was a special annoyance.

One afternoon, however, I got leave to stay at home, because I really
had a cold. His sisters were gone to Morton in my stead: I sat reading
Schiller; he, deciphering his crabbed Oriental scrolls. As I exchanged
a translation for an exercise, I happened to look his way: there I
found myself under the influence of the ever-watchful blue eye. How
long it had been searching me through and through, and over and over, I
cannot tell: so keen was it, and yet so cold, I felt for the moment
superstitious—as if I were sitting in the room with something uncanny.

“Jane, what are you doing?”

“Learning German.”

“I want you to give up German and learn Hindostanee.”

“You are not in earnest?”

“In such earnest that I must have it so: and I will tell you why.”

He then went on to explain that Hindostanee was the language he was
himself at present studying; that, as he advanced, he was apt to forget
the commencement; that it would assist him greatly to have a pupil with
whom he might again and again go over the elements, and so fix them
thoroughly in his mind; that his choice had hovered for some time
between me and his sisters; but that he had fixed on me because he saw
I could sit at a task the longest of the three. Would I do him this
favour? I should not, perhaps, have to make the sacrifice long, as it
wanted now barely three months to his departure.

St. John was not a man to be lightly refused: you felt that every
impression made on him, either for pain or pleasure, was deep-graved
and permanent. I consented. When Diana and Mary returned, the former
found her scholar transferred from her to her brother: she laughed, and
both she and Mary agreed that St. John should never have persuaded them
to such a step. He answered quietly—

“I know it.”

I found him a very patient, very forbearing, and yet an exacting
master: he expected me to do a great deal; and when I fulfilled his
expectations, he, in his own way, fully testified his approbation. By
degrees, he acquired a certain influence over me that took away my
liberty of mind: his praise and notice were more restraining than his
indifference. I could no longer talk or laugh freely when he was by,
because a tiresomely importunate instinct reminded me that vivacity (at
least in me) was distasteful to him. I was so fully aware that only
serious moods and occupations were acceptable, that in his presence
every effort to sustain or follow any other became vain: I fell under a
freezing spell. When he said “go,” I went; “come,” I came; “do this,” I
did it. But I did not love my servitude: I wished, many a time, he had
continued to neglect me.

One evening when, at bedtime, his sisters and I stood round him,
bidding him good-night, he kissed each of them, as was his custom; and,
as was equally his custom, he gave me his hand. Diana, who chanced to
be in a frolicsome humour (_she_ was not painfully controlled by his
will; for hers, in another way, was as strong), exclaimed—

“St. John! you used to call Jane your third sister, but you don’t treat
her as such: you should kiss her too.”

She pushed me towards him. I thought Diana very provoking, and felt
uncomfortably confused; and while I was thus thinking and feeling, St.
John bent his head; his Greek face was brought to a level with mine,
his eyes questioned my eyes piercingly—he kissed me. There are no such
things as marble kisses or ice kisses, or I should say my
ecclesiastical cousin’s salute belonged to one of these classes; but
there may be experiment kisses, and his was an experiment kiss. When
given, he viewed me to learn the result; it was not striking: I am sure
I did not blush; perhaps I might have turned a little pale, for I felt
as if this kiss were a seal affixed to my fetters. He never omitted the
ceremony afterwards, and the gravity and quiescence with which I
underwent it, seemed to invest it for him with a certain charm.

As for me, I daily wished more to please him; but to do so, I felt
daily more and more that I must disown half my nature, stifle half my
faculties, wrest my tastes from their original bent, force myself to
the adoption of pursuits for which I had no natural vocation. He wanted
to train me to an elevation I could never reach; it racked me hourly to
aspire to the standard he uplifted. The thing was as impossible as to
mould my irregular features to his correct and classic pattern, to give
to my changeable green eyes the sea-blue tint and solemn lustre of his
own.

Not his ascendancy alone, however, held me in thrall at present. Of
late it had been easy enough for me to look sad: a cankering evil sat
at my heart and drained my happiness at its source—the evil of
suspense.

Perhaps you think I had forgotten Mr. Rochester, reader, amidst these
changes of place and fortune. Not for a moment. His idea was still with
me, because it was not a vapour sunshine could disperse, nor a
sand-traced effigy storms could wash away; it was a name graven on a
tablet, fated to last as long as the marble it inscribed. The craving
to know what had become of him followed me everywhere; when I was at
Morton, I re-entered my cottage every evening to think of that; and now
at Moor House, I sought my bedroom each night to brood over it.

In the course of my necessary correspondence with Mr. Briggs about the
will, I had inquired if he knew anything of Mr. Rochester’s present
residence and state of health; but, as St. John had conjectured, he was
quite ignorant of all concerning him. I then wrote to Mrs. Fairfax,
entreating information on the subject. I had calculated with certainty
on this step answering my end: I felt sure it would elicit an early
answer. I was astonished when a fortnight passed without reply; but
when two months wore away, and day after day the post arrived and
brought nothing for me, I fell a prey to the keenest anxiety.

I wrote again: there was a chance of my first letter having missed.
Renewed hope followed renewed effort: it shone like the former for some
weeks, then, like it, it faded, flickered: not a line, not a word
reached me. When half a year wasted in vain expectancy, my hope died
out, and then I felt dark indeed.

A fine spring shone round me, which I could not enjoy. Summer
approached; Diana tried to cheer me: she said I looked ill, and wished
to accompany me to the sea-side. This St. John opposed; he said I did
not want dissipation, I wanted employment; my present life was too
purposeless, I required an aim; and, I suppose, by way of supplying
deficiencies, he prolonged still further my lessons in Hindostanee, and
grew more urgent in requiring their accomplishment: and I, like a fool,
never thought of resisting him—I could not resist him.

One day I had come to my studies in lower spirits than usual; the ebb
was occasioned by a poignantly felt disappointment. Hannah had told me
in the morning there was a letter for me, and when I went down to take
it, almost certain that the long-looked for tidings were vouchsafed me
at last, I found only an unimportant note from Mr. Briggs on business.
The bitter check had wrung from me some tears; and now, as I sat poring
over the crabbed characters and flourishing tropes of an Indian scribe,
my eyes filled again.

St. John called me to his side to read; in attempting to do this my
voice failed me: words were lost in sobs. He and I were the only
occupants of the parlour: Diana was practising her music in the
drawing-room, Mary was gardening—it was a very fine May day, clear,
sunny, and breezy. My companion expressed no surprise at this emotion,
nor did he question me as to its cause; he only said—

“We will wait a few minutes, Jane, till you are more composed.” And
while I smothered the paroxysm with all haste, he sat calm and patient,
leaning on his desk, and looking like a physician watching with the eye
of science an expected and fully understood crisis in a patient’s
malady. Having stifled my sobs, wiped my eyes, and muttered something
about not being very well that morning, I resumed my task, and
succeeded in completing it. St. John put away my books and his, locked
his desk, and said—

“Now, Jane, you shall take a walk; and with me.”

“I will call Diana and Mary.”

“No; I want only one companion this morning, and that must be you. Put
on your things; go out by the kitchen-door: take the road towards the
head of Marsh Glen: I will join you in a moment.”

I know no medium: I never in my life have known any medium in my
dealings with positive, hard characters, antagonistic to my own,
between absolute submission and determined revolt. I have always
faithfully observed the one, up to the very moment of bursting,
sometimes with volcanic vehemence, into the other; and as neither
present circumstances warranted, nor my present mood inclined me to
mutiny, I observed careful obedience to St. John’s directions; and in
ten minutes I was treading the wild track of the glen, side by side
with him.

The breeze was from the west: it came over the hills, sweet with scents
of heath and rush; the sky was of stainless blue; the stream descending
the ravine, swelled with past spring rains, poured along plentiful and
clear, catching golden gleams from the sun, and sapphire tints from the
firmament. As we advanced and left the track, we trod a soft turf,
mossy fine and emerald green, minutely enamelled with a tiny white
flower, and spangled with a star-like yellow blossom: the hills,
meantime, shut us quite in; for the glen, towards its head, wound to
their very core.

“Let us rest here,” said St. John, as we reached the first stragglers
of a battalion of rocks, guarding a sort of pass, beyond which the beck
rushed down a waterfall; and where, still a little farther, the
mountain shook off turf and flower, had only heath for raiment and crag
for gem—where it exaggerated the wild to the savage, and exchanged the
fresh for the frowning—where it guarded the forlorn hope of solitude,
and a last refuge for silence.

I took a seat: St. John stood near me. He looked up the pass and down
the hollow; his glance wandered away with the stream, and returned to
traverse the unclouded heaven which coloured it: he removed his hat,
let the breeze stir his hair and kiss his brow. He seemed in communion
with the genius of the haunt: with his eye he bade farewell to
something.

“And I shall see it again,” he said aloud, “in dreams when I sleep by
the Ganges: and again in a more remote hour—when another slumber
overcomes me—on the shore of a darker stream!”

Strange words of a strange love! An austere patriot’s passion for his
fatherland! He sat down; for half-an-hour we never spoke; neither he to
me nor I to him: that interval past, he recommenced—

“Jane, I go in six weeks; I have taken my berth in an East Indiaman
which sails on the 20th of June.”

“God will protect you; for you have undertaken His work,” I answered.

“Yes,” said he, “there is my glory and joy. I am the servant of an
infallible Master. I am not going out under human guidance, subject to
the defective laws and erring control of my feeble fellow-worms: my
king, my lawgiver, my captain, is the All-perfect. It seems strange to
me that all round me do not burn to enlist under the same banner,—to
join in the same enterprise.”

“All have not your powers, and it would be folly for the feeble to wish
to march with the strong.”

“I do not speak to the feeble, or think of them: I address only such as
are worthy of the work, and competent to accomplish it.”

“Those are few in number, and difficult to discover.”

“You say truly; but when found, it is right to stir them up—to urge and
exhort them to the effort—to show them what their gifts are, and why
they were given—to speak Heaven’s message in their ear,—to offer them,
direct from God, a place in the ranks of His chosen.”

“If they are really qualified for the task, will not their own hearts
be the first to inform them of it?”

I felt as if an awful charm was framing round and gathering over me: I
trembled to hear some fatal word spoken which would at once declare and
rivet the spell.

“And what does _your_ heart say?” demanded St. John.

“My heart is mute,—my heart is mute,” I answered, struck and thrilled.

“Then I must speak for it,” continued the deep, relentless voice.
“Jane, come with me to India: come as my helpmeet and fellow-labourer.”

The glen and sky spun round: the hills heaved! It was as if I had heard
a summons from Heaven—as if a visionary messenger, like him of
Macedonia, had enounced, “Come over and help us!” But I was no
apostle,—I could not behold the herald,—I could not receive his call.

“Oh, St. John!” I cried, “have some mercy!”

I appealed to one who, in the discharge of what he believed his duty,
knew neither mercy nor remorse. He continued—

“God and nature intended you for a missionary’s wife. It is not
personal, but mental endowments they have given you: you are formed for
labour, not for love. A missionary’s wife you must—shall be. You shall
be mine: I claim you—not for my pleasure, but for my Sovereign’s
service.”

“I am not fit for it: I have no vocation,” I said.

He had calculated on these first objections: he was not irritated by
them. Indeed, as he leaned back against the crag behind him, folded his
arms on his chest, and fixed his countenance, I saw he was prepared for
a long and trying opposition, and had taken in a stock of patience to
last him to its close—resolved, however, that that close should be
conquest for him.

“Humility, Jane,” said he, “is the groundwork of Christian virtues: you
say right that you are not fit for the work. Who is fit for it? Or who,
that ever was truly called, believed himself worthy of the summons? I,
for instance, am but dust and ashes. With St. Paul, I acknowledge
myself the chiefest of sinners; but I do not suffer this sense of my
personal vileness to daunt me. I know my Leader: that He is just as
well as mighty; and while He has chosen a feeble instrument to perform
a great task, He will, from the boundless stores of His providence,
supply the inadequacy of the means to the end. Think like me,
Jane—trust like me. It is the Rock of Ages I ask you to lean on: do not
doubt but it will bear the weight of your human weakness.”

“I do not understand a missionary life: I have never studied missionary
labours.”

“There I, humble as I am, can give you the aid you want: I can set you
your task from hour to hour; stand by you always; help you from moment
to moment. This I could do in the beginning: soon (for I know your
powers) you would be as strong and apt as myself, and would not require
my help.”

“But my powers—where are they for this undertaking? I do not feel them.
Nothing speaks or stirs in me while you talk. I am sensible of no light
kindling—no life quickening—no voice counselling or cheering. Oh, I
wish I could make you see how much my mind is at this moment like a
rayless dungeon, with one shrinking fear fettered in its depths—the
fear of being persuaded by you to attempt what I cannot accomplish!”

“I have an answer for you—hear it. I have watched you ever since we
first met: I have made you my study for ten months. I have proved you
in that time by sundry tests: and what have I seen and elicited? In the
village school I found you could perform well, punctually, uprightly,
labour uncongenial to your habits and inclinations; I saw you could
perform it with capacity and tact: you could win while you controlled.
In the calm with which you learnt you had become suddenly rich, I read
a mind clear of the vice of Demas:—lucre had no undue power over you.
In the resolute readiness with which you cut your wealth into four
shares, keeping but one to yourself, and relinquishing the three others
to the claim of abstract justice, I recognised a soul that revelled in
the flame and excitement of sacrifice. In the tractability with which,
at my wish, you forsook a study in which you were interested, and
adopted another because it interested me; in the untiring assiduity
with which you have since persevered in it—in the unflagging energy and
unshaken temper with which you have met its difficulties—I acknowledge
the complement of the qualities I seek. Jane, you are docile, diligent,
disinterested, faithful, constant, and courageous; very gentle, and
very heroic: cease to mistrust yourself—I can trust you unreservedly.
As a conductress of Indian schools, and a helper amongst Indian women,
your assistance will be to me invaluable.”

My iron shroud contracted round me; persuasion advanced with slow sure
step. Shut my eyes as I would, these last words of his succeeded in
making the way, which had seemed blocked up, comparatively clear. My
work, which had appeared so vague, so hopelessly diffuse, condensed
itself as he proceeded, and assumed a definite form under his shaping
hand. He waited for an answer. I demanded a quarter of an hour to
think, before I again hazarded a reply.

“Very willingly,” he rejoined; and rising, he strode a little distance
up the pass, threw himself down on a swell of heath, and there lay
still.


He threw himself down on a swell of heath, and there lay still

“I _can_ do what he wants me to do: I am forced to see and acknowledge
that,” I meditated,—“that is, if life be spared me. But I feel mine is
not the existence to be long protracted under an Indian sun. What then?
He does not care for that: when my time came to die, he would resign
me, in all serenity and sanctity, to the God who gave me. The case is
very plain before me. In leaving England, I should leave a loved but
empty land—Mr. Rochester is not there; and if he were, what is, what
can that ever be to me? My business is to live without him now: nothing
so absurd, so weak as to drag on from day to day, as if I were waiting
some impossible change in circumstances, which might reunite me to him.
Of course (as St. John once said) I must seek another interest in life
to replace the one lost: is not the occupation he now offers me truly
the most glorious man can adopt or God assign? Is it not, by its noble
cares and sublime results, the one best calculated to fill the void
left by uptorn affections and demolished hopes? I believe I must say,
Yes—and yet I shudder. Alas! If I join St. John, I abandon half myself:
if I go to India, I go to premature death. And how will the interval
between leaving England for India, and India for the grave, be filled?
Oh, I know well! That, too, is very clear to my vision. By straining to
satisfy St. John till my sinews ache, I _shall_ satisfy him—to the
finest central point and farthest outward circle of his expectations.
If I _do_ go with him—if I _do_ make the sacrifice he urges, I will
make it absolutely: I will throw all on the altar—heart, vitals, the
entire victim. He will never love me; but he shall approve me; I will
show him energies he has not yet seen, resources he has never
suspected. Yes, I can work as hard as he can, and with as little
grudging.

“Consent, then, to his demand is possible: but for one item—one
dreadful item. It is—that he asks me to be his wife, and has no more of
a husband’s heart for me than that frowning giant of a rock, down which
the stream is foaming in yonder gorge. He prizes me as a soldier would
a good weapon; and that is all. Unmarried to him, this would never
grieve me; but can I let him complete his calculations—coolly put into
practice his plans—go through the wedding ceremony? Can I receive from
him the bridal ring, endure all the forms of love (which I doubt not he
would scrupulously observe) and know that the spirit was quite absent?
Can I bear the consciousness that every endearment he bestows is a
sacrifice made on principle? No: such a martyrdom would be monstrous. I
will never undergo it. As his sister, I might accompany him—not as his
wife: I will tell him so.”

I looked towards the knoll: there he lay, still as a prostrate column;
his face turned to me: his eye beaming watchful and keen. He started to
his feet and approached me.

“I am ready to go to India, if I may go free.”

“Your answer requires a commentary,” he said; “it is not clear.”

“You have hitherto been my adopted brother—I, your adopted sister: let
us continue as such: you and I had better not marry.”

He shook his head. “Adopted fraternity will not do in this case. If you
were my real sister it would be different: I should take you, and seek
no wife. But as it is, either our union must be consecrated and sealed
by marriage, or it cannot exist: practical obstacles oppose themselves
to any other plan. Do you not see it, Jane? Consider a moment—your
strong sense will guide you.”

I did consider; and still my sense, such as it was, directed me only to
the fact that we did not love each other as man and wife should: and
therefore it inferred we ought not to marry. I said so. “St. John,” I
returned, “I regard you as a brother—you, me as a sister: so let us
continue.”

“We cannot—we cannot,” he answered, with short, sharp determination:
“it would not do. You have said you will go with me to India:
remember—you have said that.”

“Conditionally.”

“Well—well. To the main point—the departure with me from England, the
co-operation with me in my future labours—you do not object. You have
already as good as put your hand to the plough: you are too consistent
to withdraw it. You have but one end to keep in view—how the work you
have undertaken can best be done. Simplify your complicated interests,
feelings, thoughts, wishes, aims; merge all considerations in one
purpose: that of fulfilling with effect—with power—the mission of your
great Master. To do so, you must have a coadjutor: not a brother—that
is a loose tie—but a husband. I, too, do not want a sister: a sister
might any day be taken from me. I want a wife: the sole helpmeet I can
influence efficiently in life, and retain absolutely till death.”

I shuddered as he spoke: I felt his influence in my marrow—his hold on
my limbs.

“Seek one elsewhere than in me, St. John: seek one fitted to you.”

“One fitted to my purpose, you mean—fitted to my vocation. Again I tell
you it is not the insignificant private individual—the mere man, with
the man’s selfish senses—I wish to mate: it is the missionary.”

“And I will give the missionary my energies—it is all he wants—but not
myself: that would be only adding the husk and shell to the kernel. For
them he has no use: I retain them.”

“You cannot—you ought not. Do you think God will be satisfied with half
an oblation? Will He accept a mutilated sacrifice? It is the cause of
God I advocate: it is under His standard I enlist you. I cannot accept
on His behalf a divided allegiance: it must be entire.”

“Oh! I will give my heart to God,” I said. “_You_ do not want it.”

I will not swear, reader, that there was not something of repressed
sarcasm both in the tone in which I uttered this sentence, and in the
feeling that accompanied it. I had silently feared St. John till now,
because I had not understood him. He had held me in awe, because he had
held me in doubt. How much of him was saint, how much mortal, I could
not heretofore tell: but revelations were being made in this
conference: the analysis of his nature was proceeding before my eyes. I
saw his fallibilities: I comprehended them. I understood that, sitting
there where I did, on the bank of heath, and with that handsome form
before me, I sat at the feet of a man, erring as I. The veil fell from
his hardness and despotism. Having felt in him the presence of these
qualities, I felt his imperfection and took courage. I was with an
equal—one with whom I might argue—one whom, if I saw good, I might
resist.

He was silent after I had uttered the last sentence, and I presently
risked an upward glance at his countenance. His eye, bent on me,
expressed at once stern surprise and keen inquiry. “Is she sarcastic,
and sarcastic to _me!_” it seemed to say. “What does this signify?”

“Do not let us forget that this is a solemn matter,” he said ere long;
“one of which we may neither think nor talk lightly without sin. I
trust, Jane, you are in earnest when you say you will serve your heart
to God: it is all I want. Once wrench your heart from man, and fix it
on your Maker, the advancement of that Maker’s spiritual kingdom on
earth will be your chief delight and endeavour; you will be ready to do
at once whatever furthers that end. You will see what impetus would be
given to your efforts and mine by our physical and mental union in
marriage: the only union that gives a character of permanent conformity
to the destinies and designs of human beings; and, passing over all
minor caprices—all trivial difficulties and delicacies of feeling—all
scruple about the degree, kind, strength or tenderness of mere personal
inclination—you will hasten to enter into that union at once.”

“Shall I?” I said briefly; and I looked at his features, beautiful in
their harmony, but strangely formidable in their still severity; at his
brow, commanding but not open; at his eyes, bright and deep and
searching, but never soft; at his tall imposing figure; and fancied
myself in idea _his wife_. Oh! it would never do! As his curate, his
comrade, all would be right: I would cross oceans with him in that
capacity; toil under Eastern suns, in Asian deserts with him in that
office; admire and emulate his courage and devotion and vigour;
accommodate quietly to his masterhood; smile undisturbed at his
ineradicable ambition; discriminate the Christian from the man:
profoundly esteem the one, and freely forgive the other. I should
suffer often, no doubt, attached to him only in this capacity: my body
would be under rather a stringent yoke, but my heart and mind would be
free. I should still have my unblighted self to turn to: my natural
unenslaved feelings with which to communicate in moments of loneliness.
There would be recesses in my mind which would be only mine, to which
he never came, and sentiments growing there fresh and sheltered which
his austerity could never blight, nor his measured warrior-march
trample down: but as his wife—at his side always, and always
restrained, and always checked—forced to keep the fire of my nature
continually low, to compel it to burn inwardly and never utter a cry,
though the imprisoned flame consumed vital after vital—_this_ would be
unendurable.

“St. John!” I exclaimed, when I had got so far in my meditation.

“Well?” he answered icily.

“I repeat I freely consent to go with you as your fellow-missionary,
but not as your wife; I cannot marry you and become part of you.”

“A part of me you must become,” he answered steadily; “otherwise the
whole bargain is void. How can I, a man not yet thirty, take out with
me to India a girl of nineteen, unless she be married to me? How can we
be for ever together—sometimes in solitudes, sometimes amidst savage
tribes—and unwed?”

“Very well,” I said shortly; “under the circumstances, quite as well as
if I were either your real sister, or a man and a clergyman like
yourself.”

“It is known that you are not my sister; I cannot introduce you as
such: to attempt it would be to fasten injurious suspicions on us both.
And for the rest, though you have a man’s vigorous brain, you have a
woman’s heart and—it would not do.”

“It would do,” I affirmed with some disdain, “perfectly well. I have a
woman’s heart, but not where you are concerned; for you I have only a
comrade’s constancy; a fellow-soldier’s frankness, fidelity,
fraternity, if you like; a neophyte’s respect and submission to his
hierophant: nothing more—don’t fear.”

“It is what I want,” he said, speaking to himself; “it is just what I
want. And there are obstacles in the way: they must be hewn down. Jane,
you would not repent marrying me—be certain of that; we _must_ be
married. I repeat it: there is no other way; and undoubtedly enough of
love would follow upon marriage to render the union right even in your
eyes.”

“I scorn your idea of love,” I could not help saying, as I rose up and
stood before him, leaning my back against the rock. “I scorn the
counterfeit sentiment you offer: yes, St. John, and I scorn you when
you offer it.”

He looked at me fixedly, compressing his well-cut lips while he did so.
Whether he was incensed or surprised, or what, it was not easy to tell:
he could command his countenance thoroughly.

“I scarcely expected to hear that expression from you,” he said: “I
think I have done and uttered nothing to deserve scorn.”

I was touched by his gentle tone, and overawed by his high, calm mien.

“Forgive me the words, St. John; but it is your own fault that I have
been roused to speak so unguardedly. You have introduced a topic on
which our natures are at variance—a topic we should never discuss: the
very name of love is an apple of discord between us. If the reality
were required, what should we do? How should we feel? My dear cousin,
abandon your scheme of marriage—forget it.”

“No,” said he; “it is a long-cherished scheme, and the only one which
can secure my great end: but I shall urge you no further at present.
To-morrow, I leave home for Cambridge: I have many friends there to
whom I should wish to say farewell. I shall be absent a fortnight—take
that space of time to consider my offer: and do not forget that if you
reject it, it is not me you deny, but God. Through my means, He opens
to you a noble career; as my wife only can you enter upon it. Refuse to
be my wife, and you limit yourself for ever to a track of selfish ease
and barren obscurity. Tremble lest in that case you should be numbered
with those who have denied the faith, and are worse than infidels!”

He had done. Turning from me, he once more

“Looked to river, looked to hill.”


But this time his feelings were all pent in his heart: I was not worthy
to hear them uttered. As I walked by his side homeward, I read well in
his iron silence all he felt towards me: the disappointment of an
austere and despotic nature, which has met resistance where it expected
submission—the disapprobation of a cool, inflexible judgment, which has
detected in another feelings and views in which it has no power to
sympathise: in short, as a man, he would have wished to coerce me into
obedience: it was only as a sincere Christian he bore so patiently with
my perversity, and allowed so long a space for reflection and
repentance.

That night, after he had kissed his sisters, he thought proper to
forget even to shake hands with me, but left the room in silence.
I—who, though I had no love, had much friendship for him—was hurt by
the marked omission: so much hurt that tears started to my eyes.

“I see you and St. John have been quarrelling, Jane,” said Diana,
“during your walk on the moor. But go after him; he is now lingering in
the passage expecting you—he will make it up.”

I have not much pride under such circumstances: I would always rather
be happy than dignified; and I ran after him—he stood at the foot of
the stairs.

“Good-night, St. John,” said I.

“Good-night, Jane,” he replied calmly.

“Then shake hands,” I added.

What a cold, loose touch, he impressed on my fingers! He was deeply
displeased by what had occurred that day; cordiality would not warm,
nor tears move him. No happy reconciliation was to be had with him—no
cheering smile or generous word: but still the Christian was patient
and placid; and when I asked him if he forgave me, he answered that he
was not in the habit of cherishing the remembrance of vexation; that he
had nothing to forgive, not having been offended.

And with that answer he left me. I would much rather he had knocked me
down.




CHAPTER XXXV


He did not leave for Cambridge the next day, as he had said he would.
He deferred his departure a whole week, and during that time he made me
feel what severe punishment a good yet stern, a conscientious yet
implacable man can inflict on one who has offended him. Without one
overt act of hostility, one upbraiding word, he contrived to impress me
momently with the conviction that I was put beyond the pale of his
favour.

Not that St. John harboured a spirit of unchristian vindictiveness—not
that he would have injured a hair of my head, if it had been fully in
his power to do so. Both by nature and principle, he was superior to
the mean gratification of vengeance: he had forgiven me for saying I
scorned him and his love, but he had not forgotten the words; and as
long as he and I lived he never would forget them. I saw by his look,
when he turned to me, that they were always written on the air between
me and him; whenever I spoke, they sounded in my voice to his ear, and
their echo toned every answer he gave me.

He did not abstain from conversing with me: he even called me as usual
each morning to join him at his desk; and I fear the corrupt man within
him had a pleasure unimparted to, and unshared by, the pure Christian,
in evincing with what skill he could, while acting and speaking
apparently just as usual, extract from every deed and every phrase the
spirit of interest and approval which had formerly communicated a
certain austere charm to his language and manner. To me, he was in
reality become no longer flesh, but marble; his eye was a cold, bright,
blue gem; his tongue a speaking instrument—nothing more.

All this was torture to me—refined, lingering torture. It kept up a
slow fire of indignation and a trembling trouble of grief, which
harassed and crushed me altogether. I felt how—if I were his wife, this
good man, pure as the deep sunless source, could soon kill me, without
drawing from my veins a single drop of blood, or receiving on his own
crystal conscience the faintest stain of crime. Especially I felt this
when I made any attempt to propitiate him. No ruth met my ruth. _He_
experienced no suffering from estrangement—no yearning after
reconciliation; and though, more than once, my fast falling tears
blistered the page over which we both bent, they produced no more
effect on him than if his heart had been really a matter of stone or
metal. To his sisters, meantime, he was somewhat kinder than usual: as
if afraid that mere coldness would not sufficiently convince me how
completely I was banished and banned, he added the force of contrast;
and this I am sure he did not by malice, but on principle.

The night before he left home, happening to see him walking in the
garden about sunset, and remembering, as I looked at him, that this
man, alienated as he now was, had once saved my life, and that we were
near relations, I was moved to make a last attempt to regain his
friendship. I went out and approached him as he stood leaning over the
little gate; I spoke to the point at once.

“St. John, I am unhappy because you are still angry with me. Let us be
friends.”

“I hope we are friends,” was the unmoved reply; while he still watched
the rising of the moon, which he had been contemplating as I
approached.

“No, St. John, we are not friends as we were. You know that.”

“Are we not? That is wrong. For my part, I wish you no ill and all
good.”

“I believe you, St. John; for I am sure you are incapable of wishing
any one ill; but, as I am your kinswoman, I should desire somewhat more
of affection than that sort of general philanthropy you extend to mere
strangers.”

“Of course,” he said. “Your wish is reasonable, and I am far from
regarding you as a stranger.”

This, spoken in a cool, tranquil tone, was mortifying and baffling
enough. Had I attended to the suggestions of pride and ire, I should
immediately have left him; but something worked within me more strongly
than those feelings could. I deeply venerated my cousin’s talent and
principle. His friendship was of value to me: to lose it tried me
severely. I would not so soon relinquish the attempt to reconquer it.

“Must we part in this way, St. John? And when you go to India, will you
leave me so, without a kinder word than you have yet spoken?”

He now turned quite from the moon and faced me.

“When I go to India, Jane, will I leave you! What! do you not go to
India?”

“You said I could not unless I married you.”

“And you will not marry me! You adhere to that resolution?”

Reader, do you know, as I do, what terror those cold people can put
into the ice of their questions? How much of the fall of the avalanche
is in their anger? of the breaking up of the frozen sea in their
displeasure?

“No. St. John, I will not marry you. I adhere to my resolution.”

The avalanche had shaken and slid a little forward, but it did not yet
crash down.

“Once more, why this refusal?” he asked.

“Formerly,” I answered, “because you did not love me; now, I reply,
because you almost hate me. If I were to marry you, you would kill me.
You are killing me now.”

His lips and cheeks turned white—quite white.

“_I should kill you_—_I am killing you_? Your words are such as ought
not to be used: violent, unfeminine, and untrue. They betray an
unfortunate state of mind: they merit severe reproof: they would seem
inexcusable, but that it is the duty of man to forgive his fellow even
until seventy-and-seven times.”

I had finished the business now. While earnestly wishing to erase from
his mind the trace of my former offence, I had stamped on that
tenacious surface another and far deeper impression: I had burnt it in.

“Now you will indeed hate me,” I said. “It is useless to attempt to
conciliate you: I see I have made an eternal enemy of you.”

A fresh wrong did these words inflict: the worse, because they touched
on the truth. That bloodless lip quivered to a temporary spasm. I knew
the steely ire I had whetted. I was heart-wrung.

“You utterly misinterpret my words,” I said, at once seizing his hand:
“I have no intention to grieve or pain you—indeed, I have not.”

Most bitterly he smiled—most decidedly he withdrew his hand from mine.
“And now you recall your promise, and will not go to India at all, I
presume?” said he, after a considerable pause.

“Yes, I will, as your assistant,” I answered.

A very long silence succeeded. What struggle there was in him between
Nature and Grace in this interval, I cannot tell: only singular gleams
scintillated in his eyes, and strange shadows passed over his face. He
spoke at last.

“I before proved to you the absurdity of a single woman of your age
proposing to accompany abroad a single man of mine. I proved it to you
in such terms as, I should have thought, would have prevented your ever
again alluding to the plan. That you have done so, I regret—for your
sake.”

I interrupted him. Anything like a tangible reproach gave me courage at
once. “Keep to common sense, St. John: you are verging on nonsense. You
pretend to be shocked by what I have said. You are not really shocked:
for, with your superior mind, you cannot be either so dull or so
conceited as to misunderstand my meaning. I say again, I will be your
curate, if you like, but never your wife.”

Again he turned lividly pale; but, as before, controlled his passion
perfectly. He answered emphatically but calmly—

“A female curate, who is not my wife, would never suit me. With me,
then, it seems, you cannot go: but if you are sincere in your offer, I
will, while in town, speak to a married missionary, whose wife needs a
coadjutor. Your own fortune will make you independent of the Society’s
aid; and thus you may still be spared the dishonour of breaking your
promise and deserting the band you engaged to join.”

Now I never had, as the reader knows, either given any formal promise
or entered into any engagement; and this language was all much too hard
and much too despotic for the occasion. I replied—

“There is no dishonour, no breach of promise, no desertion in the case.
I am not under the slightest obligation to go to India, especially with
strangers. With you I would have ventured much, because I admire,
confide in, and, as a sister, I love you; but I am convinced that, go
when and with whom I would, I should not live long in that climate.”

“Ah! you are afraid of yourself,” he said, curling his lip.

“I am. God did not give me my life to throw away; and to do as you wish
me would, I begin to think, be almost equivalent to committing suicide.
Moreover, before I definitively resolve on quitting England, I will
know for certain whether I cannot be of greater use by remaining in it
than by leaving it.”

“What do you mean?”

“It would be fruitless to attempt to explain; but there is a point on
which I have long endured painful doubt, and I can go nowhere till by
some means that doubt is removed.”

“I know where your heart turns and to what it clings. The interest you
cherish is lawless and unconsecrated. Long since you ought to have
crushed it: now you should blush to allude to it. You think of Mr.
Rochester?”

It was true. I confessed it by silence.

“Are you going to seek Mr. Rochester?”

“I must find out what is become of him.”

“It remains for me, then,” he said, “to remember you in my prayers, and
to entreat God for you, in all earnestness, that you may not indeed
become a castaway. I had thought I recognised in you one of the chosen.
But God sees not as man sees: _His_ will be done—”

He opened the gate, passed through it, and strayed away down the glen.
He was soon out of sight.

On re-entering the parlour, I found Diana standing at the window,
looking very thoughtful. Diana was a great deal taller than I: she put
her hand on my shoulder, and, stooping, examined my face.

“Jane,” she said, “you are always agitated and pale now. I am sure
there is something the matter. Tell me what business St. John and you
have on hands. I have watched you this half hour from the window; you
must forgive my being such a spy, but for a long time I have fancied I
hardly know what. St. John is a strange being—”

She paused—I did not speak: soon she resumed—

“That brother of mine cherishes peculiar views of some sort respecting
you, I am sure: he has long distinguished you by a notice and interest
he never showed to any one else—to what end? I wish he loved you—does
he, Jane?”

I put her cool hand to my hot forehead; “No, Die, not one whit.”

“Then why does he follow you so with his eyes, and get you so
frequently alone with him, and keep you so continually at his side?
Mary and I had both concluded he wished you to marry him.”

“He does—he has asked me to be his wife.”

Diana clapped her hands. “That is just what we hoped and thought! And
you will marry him, Jane, won’t you? And then he will stay in England.”

“Far from that, Diana; his sole idea in proposing to me is to procure a
fitting fellow-labourer in his Indian toils.”

“What! He wishes you to go to India?”

“Yes.”

“Madness!” she exclaimed. “You would not live three months there, I am
certain. You never shall go: you have not consented, have you, Jane?”

“I have refused to marry him—”

“And have consequently displeased him?” she suggested.

“Deeply: he will never forgive me, I fear: yet I offered to accompany
him as his sister.”

“It was frantic folly to do so, Jane. Think of the task you
undertook—one of incessant fatigue, where fatigue kills even the
strong, and you are weak. St. John—you know him—would urge you to
impossibilities: with him there would be no permission to rest during
the hot hours; and unfortunately, I have noticed, whatever he exacts,
you force yourself to perform. I am astonished you found courage to
refuse his hand. You do not love him then, Jane?”

“Not as a husband.”

“Yet he is a handsome fellow.”

“And I am so plain, you see, Die. We should never suit.”

“Plain! You? Not at all. You are much too pretty, as well as too good,
to be grilled alive in Calcutta.” And again she earnestly conjured me
to give up all thoughts of going out with her brother.

“I must indeed,” I said; “for when just now I repeated the offer of
serving him for a deacon, he expressed himself shocked at my want of
decency. He seemed to think I had committed an impropriety in proposing
to accompany him unmarried: as if I had not from the first hoped to
find in him a brother, and habitually regarded him as such.”

“What makes you say he does not love you, Jane?”

“You should hear himself on the subject. He has again and again
explained that it is not himself, but his office he wishes to mate. He
has told me I am formed for labour—not for love: which is true, no
doubt. But, in my opinion, if I am not formed for love, it follows that
I am not formed for marriage. Would it not be strange, Die, to be
chained for life to a man who regarded one but as a useful tool?”

“Insupportable—unnatural—out of the question!”

“And then,” I continued, “though I have only sisterly affection for him
now, yet, if forced to be his wife, I can imagine the possibility of
conceiving an inevitable, strange, torturing kind of love for him,
because he is so talented; and there is often a certain heroic grandeur
in his look, manner, and conversation. In that case, my lot would
become unspeakably wretched. He would not want me to love him; and if I
showed the feeling, he would make me sensible that it was a
superfluity, unrequired by him, unbecoming in me. I know he would.”

“And yet St. John is a good man,” said Diana.

“He is a good and a great man; but he forgets, pitilessly, the feelings
and claims of little people, in pursuing his own large views. It is
better, therefore, for the insignificant to keep out of his way, lest,
in his progress, he should trample them down. Here he comes! I will
leave you, Diana.” And I hastened upstairs as I saw him entering the
garden.

But I was forced to meet him again at supper. During that meal he
appeared just as composed as usual. I had thought he would hardly speak
to me, and I was certain he had given up the pursuit of his matrimonial
scheme: the sequel showed I was mistaken on both points. He addressed
me precisely in his ordinary manner, or what had, of late, been his
ordinary manner—one scrupulously polite. No doubt he had invoked the
help of the Holy Spirit to subdue the anger I had roused in him, and
now believed he had forgiven me once more.

For the evening reading before prayers, he selected the twenty-first
chapter of Revelation. It was at all times pleasant to listen while
from his lips fell the words of the Bible: never did his fine voice
sound at once so sweet and full—never did his manner become so
impressive in its noble simplicity, as when he delivered the oracles of
God: and to-night that voice took a more solemn tone—that manner a more
thrilling meaning—as he sat in the midst of his household circle (the
May moon shining in through the uncurtained window, and rendering
almost unnecessary the light of the candle on the table): as he sat
there, bending over the great old Bible, and described from its page
the vision of the new heaven and the new earth—told how God would come
to dwell with men, how He would wipe away all tears from their eyes,
and promised that there should be no more death, neither sorrow nor
crying, nor any more pain, because the former things were passed away.

The succeeding words thrilled me strangely as he spoke them: especially
as I felt, by the slight, indescribable alteration in sound, that in
uttering them, his eye had turned on me.

“He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be his God,
and he shall be my son. But,” was slowly, distinctly read, “the
fearful, the unbelieving, &c., shall have their part in the lake which
burneth with fire and brimstone, which is the second death.”

Henceforward, I knew what fate St. John feared for me.

A calm, subdued triumph, blent with a longing earnestness, marked his
enunciation of the last glorious verses of that chapter. The reader
believed his name was already written in the Lamb’s book of life, and
he yearned after the hour which should admit him to the city to which
the kings of the earth bring their glory and honour; which has no need
of sun or moon to shine in it, because the glory of God lightens it,
and the Lamb is the light thereof.

In the prayer following the chapter, all his energy gathered—all his
stern zeal woke: he was in deep earnest, wrestling with God, and
resolved on a conquest. He supplicated strength for the weak-hearted;
guidance for wanderers from the fold: a return, even at the eleventh
hour, for those whom the temptations of the world and the flesh were
luring from the narrow path. He asked, he urged, he claimed the boon of
a brand snatched from the burning. Earnestness is ever deeply solemn:
first, as I listened to that prayer, I wondered at his; then, when it
continued and rose, I was touched by it, and at last awed. He felt the
greatness and goodness of his purpose so sincerely: others who heard
him plead for it, could not but feel it too.

The prayer over, we took leave of him: he was to go at a very early
hour in the morning. Diana and Mary having kissed him, left the room—in
compliance, I think, with a whispered hint from him: I tendered my
hand, and wished him a pleasant journey.

“Thank you, Jane. As I said, I shall return from Cambridge in a
fortnight: that space, then, is yet left you for reflection. If I
listened to human pride, I should say no more to you of marriage with
me; but I listen to my duty, and keep steadily in view my first aim—to
do all things to the glory of God. My Master was long-suffering: so
will I be. I cannot give you up to perdition as a vessel of wrath:
repent—resolve, while there is yet time. Remember, we are bid to work
while it is day—warned that ‘the night cometh when no man shall work.’
Remember the fate of Dives, who had his good things in this life. God
give you strength to choose that better part which shall not be taken
from you!”

He laid his hand on my head as he uttered the last words. He had spoken
earnestly, mildly: his look was not, indeed, that of a lover beholding
his mistress, but it was that of a pastor recalling his wandering
sheep—or better, of a guardian angel watching the soul for which he is
responsible. All men of talent, whether they be men of feeling or not;
whether they be zealots, or aspirants, or despots—provided only they be
sincere—have their sublime moments, when they subdue and rule. I felt
veneration for St. John—veneration so strong that its impetus thrust me
at once to the point I had so long shunned. I was tempted to cease
struggling with him—to rush down the torrent of his will into the gulf
of his existence, and there lose my own. I was almost as hard beset by
him now as I had been once before, in a different way, by another. I
was a fool both times. To have yielded then would have been an error of
principle; to have yielded now would have been an error of judgment. So
I think at this hour, when I look back to the crisis through the quiet
medium of time: I was unconscious of folly at the instant.

I stood motionless under my hierophant’s touch. My refusals were
forgotten—my fears overcome—my wrestlings paralysed. The
Impossible—_i.e._, my marriage with St. John—was fast becoming the
Possible. All was changing utterly with a sudden sweep. Religion
called—Angels beckoned—God commanded—life rolled together like a
scroll—death’s gates opening, showed eternity beyond: it seemed, that
for safety and bliss there, all here might be sacrificed in a second.
The dim room was full of visions.

“Could you decide now?” asked the missionary. The inquiry was put in
gentle tones: he drew me to him as gently. Oh, that gentleness! how far
more potent is it than force! I could resist St. John’s wrath: I grew
pliant as a reed under his kindness. Yet I knew all the time, if I
yielded now, I should not the less be made to repent, some day, of my
former rebellion. His nature was not changed by one hour of solemn
prayer: it was only elevated.

“I could decide if I were but certain,” I answered: “were I but
convinced that it is God’s will I should marry you, I could vow to
marry you here and now—come afterwards what would!”

“My prayers are heard!” ejaculated St. John. He pressed his hand firmer
on my head, as if he claimed me: he surrounded me with his arm,
_almost_ as if he loved me (I say _almost_—I knew the difference—for I
had felt what it was to be loved; but, like him, I had now put love out
of the question, and thought only of duty). I contended with my inward
dimness of vision, before which clouds yet rolled. I sincerely, deeply,
fervently longed to do what was right; and only that. “Show me, show me
the path!” I entreated of Heaven. I was excited more than I had ever
been; and whether what followed was the effect of excitement the reader
shall judge.

All the house was still; for I believe all, except St. John and myself,
were now retired to rest. The one candle was dying out: the room was
full of moonlight. My heart beat fast and thick: I heard its throb.
Suddenly it stood still to an inexpressible feeling that thrilled it
through, and passed at once to my head and extremities. The feeling was
not like an electric shock, but it was quite as sharp, as strange, as
startling: it acted on my senses as if their utmost activity hitherto
had been but torpor, from which they were now summoned and forced to
wake. They rose expectant: eye and ear waited while the flesh quivered
on my bones.

“What have you heard? What do you see?” asked St. John. I saw nothing,
but I heard a voice somewhere cry—

“Jane! Jane! Jane!”—nothing more.

“O God! what is it?” I gasped.

I might have said, “Where is it?” for it did not seem in the room—nor
in the house—nor in the garden; it did not come out of the air—nor from
under the earth—nor from overhead. I had heard it—where, or whence, for
ever impossible to know! And it was the voice of a human being—a known,
loved, well-remembered voice—that of Edward Fairfax Rochester; and it
spoke in pain and woe, wildly, eerily, urgently.

“I am coming!” I cried. “Wait for me! Oh, I will come!” I flew to the
door and looked into the passage: it was dark. I ran out into the
garden: it was void.

“Where are you?” I exclaimed.

The hills beyond Marsh Glen sent the answer faintly back—“Where are
you?” I listened. The wind sighed low in the firs: all was moorland
loneliness and midnight hush.

“Down superstition!” I commented, as that spectre rose up black by the
black yew at the gate. “This is not thy deception, nor thy witchcraft:
it is the work of nature. She was roused, and did—no miracle—but her
best.”

I broke from St. John, who had followed, and would have detained me. It
was _my_ time to assume ascendency. _My_ powers were in play and in
force. I told him to forbear question or remark; I desired him to leave
me: I must and would be alone. He obeyed at once. Where there is energy
to command well enough, obedience never fails. I mounted to my chamber;
locked myself in; fell on my knees; and prayed in my way—a different
way to St. John’s, but effective in its own fashion. I seemed to
penetrate very near a Mighty Spirit; and my soul rushed out in
gratitude at His feet. I rose from the thanksgiving—took a resolve—and
lay down, unscared, enlightened—eager but for the daylight.




CHAPTER XXXVI


The daylight came. I rose at dawn. I busied myself for an hour or two
with arranging my things in my chamber, drawers, and wardrobe, in the
order wherein I should wish to leave them during a brief absence.
Meantime, I heard St. John quit his room. He stopped at my door: I
feared he would knock—no, but a slip of paper was passed under the
door. I took it up. It bore these words—

“You left me too suddenly last night. Had you stayed but a little
longer, you would have laid your hand on the Christian’s cross and the
angel’s crown. I shall expect your clear decision when I return this
day fortnight. Meantime, watch and pray that you enter not into
temptation: the spirit, I trust, is willing, but the flesh, I see, is
weak. I shall pray for you hourly.—Yours, ST. JOHN.”

“My spirit,” I answered mentally, “is willing to do what is right; and
my flesh, I hope, is strong enough to accomplish the will of Heaven,
when once that will is distinctly known to me. At any rate, it shall be
strong enough to search—inquire—to grope an outlet from this cloud of
doubt, and find the open day of certainty.”

It was the first of June; yet the morning was overcast and chilly: rain
beat fast on my casement. I heard the front-door open, and St. John
pass out. Looking through the window, I saw him traverse the garden. He
took the way over the misty moors in the direction of Whitcross—there
he would meet the coach.

“In a few more hours I shall succeed you in that track, cousin,”
thought I: “I too have a coach to meet at Whitcross. I too have some to
see and ask after in England, before I depart for ever.”

It wanted yet two hours of breakfast-time. I filled the interval in
walking softly about my room, and pondering the visitation which had
given my plans their present bent. I recalled that inward sensation I
had experienced: for I could recall it, with all its unspeakable
strangeness. I recalled the voice I had heard; again I questioned
whence it came, as vainly as before: it seemed in _me_—not in the
external world. I asked was it a mere nervous impression—a delusion? I
could not conceive or believe: it was more like an inspiration. The
wondrous shock of feeling had come like the earthquake which shook the
foundations of Paul and Silas’s prison; it had opened the doors of the
soul’s cell and loosed its bands—it had wakened it out of its sleep,
whence it sprang trembling, listening, aghast; then vibrated thrice a
cry on my startled ear, and in my quaking heart and through my spirit,
which neither feared nor shook, but exulted as if in joy over the
success of one effort it had been privileged to make, independent of
the cumbrous body.

“Ere many days,” I said, as I terminated my musings, “I will know
something of him whose voice seemed last night to summon me. Letters
have proved of no avail—personal inquiry shall replace them.”

At breakfast I announced to Diana and Mary that I was going a journey,
and should be absent at least four days.

“Alone, Jane?” they asked.

“Yes; it was to see or hear news of a friend about whom I had for some
time been uneasy.”

They might have said, as I have no doubt they thought, that they had
believed me to be without any friends save them: for, indeed, I had
often said so; but, with their true natural delicacy, they abstained
from comment, except that Diana asked me if I was sure I was well
enough to travel. I looked very pale, she observed. I replied, that
nothing ailed me save anxiety of mind, which I hoped soon to alleviate.

It was easy to make my further arrangements; for I was troubled with no
inquiries—no surmises. Having once explained to them that I could not
now be explicit about my plans, they kindly and wisely acquiesced in
the silence with which I pursued them, according to me the privilege of
free action I should under similar circumstances have accorded them.

I left Moor House at three o’clock P.M., and soon after four I stood at
the foot of the sign-post of Whitcross, waiting the arrival of the
coach which was to take me to distant Thornfield. Amidst the silence of
those solitary roads and desert hills, I heard it approach from a great
distance. It was the same vehicle whence, a year ago, I had alighted
one summer evening on this very spot—how desolate, and hopeless, and
objectless! It stopped as I beckoned. I entered—not now obliged to part
with my whole fortune as the price of its accommodation. Once more on
the road to Thornfield, I felt like the messenger-pigeon flying home.

It was a journey of six-and-thirty hours. I had set out from Whitcross
on a Tuesday afternoon, and early on the succeeding Thursday morning
the coach stopped to water the horses at a wayside inn, situated in the
midst of scenery whose green hedges and large fields and low pastoral
hills (how mild of feature and verdant of hue compared with the stern
North-Midland moors of Morton!) met my eye like the lineaments of a
once familiar face. Yes, I knew the character of this landscape: I was
sure we were near my bourne.

“How far is Thornfield Hall from here?” I asked of the ostler.

“Just two miles, ma’am, across the fields.”

“My journey is closed,” I thought to myself. I got out of the coach,
gave a box I had into the ostler’s charge, to be kept till I called for
it; paid my fare; satisfied the coachman, and was going: the
brightening day gleamed on the sign of the inn, and I read in gilt
letters, “The Rochester Arms.” My heart leapt up: I was already on my
master’s very lands. It fell again: the thought struck it:—

“Your master himself may be beyond the British Channel, for aught you
know: and then, if he is at Thornfield Hall, towards which you hasten,
who besides him is there? His lunatic wife: and you have nothing to do
with him: you dare not speak to him or seek his presence. You have lost
your labour—you had better go no farther,” urged the monitor. “Ask
information of the people at the inn; they can give you all you seek:
they can solve your doubts at once. Go up to that man, and inquire if
Mr. Rochester be at home.”

The suggestion was sensible, and yet I could not force myself to act on
it. I so dreaded a reply that would crush me with despair. To prolong
doubt was to prolong hope. I might yet once more see the Hall under the
ray of her star. There was the stile before me—the very fields through
which I had hurried, blind, deaf, distracted with a revengeful fury
tracking and scourging me, on the morning I fled from Thornfield: ere I
well knew what course I had resolved to take, I was in the midst of
them. How fast I walked! How I ran sometimes! How I looked forward to
catch the first view of the well-known woods! With what feelings I
welcomed single trees I knew, and familiar glimpses of meadow and hill
between them!

At last the woods rose; the rookery clustered dark; a loud cawing broke
the morning stillness. Strange delight inspired me: on I hastened.
Another field crossed—a lane threaded—and there were the courtyard
walls—the back offices: the house itself, the rookery still hid. “My
first view of it shall be in front,” I determined, “where its bold
battlements will strike the eye nobly at once, and where I can single
out my master’s very window: perhaps he will be standing at it—he rises
early: perhaps he is now walking in the orchard, or on the pavement in
front. Could I but see him!—but a moment! Surely, in that case, I
should not be so mad as to run to him? I cannot tell—I am not certain.
And if I did—what then? God bless him! What then? Who would be hurt by
my once more tasting the life his glance can give me? I rave: perhaps
at this moment he is watching the sun rise over the Pyrenees, or on the
tideless sea of the south.”

I had coasted along the lower wall of the orchard—turned its angle:
there was a gate just there, opening into the meadow, between two stone
pillars crowned by stone balls. From behind one pillar I could peep
round quietly at the full front of the mansion. I advanced my head with
precaution, desirous to ascertain if any bedroom window-blinds were yet
drawn up: battlements, windows, long front—all from this sheltered
station were at my command.

The crows sailing overhead perhaps watched me while I took this survey.
I wonder what they thought. They must have considered I was very
careful and timid at first, and that gradually I grew very bold and
reckless. A peep, and then a long stare; and then a departure from my
niche and a straying out into the meadow; and a sudden stop full in
front of the great mansion, and a protracted, hardy gaze towards it.
“What affectation of diffidence was this at first?” they might have
demanded; “what stupid regardlessness now?”

Hear an illustration, reader.

A lover finds his mistress asleep on a mossy bank; he wishes to catch a
glimpse of her fair face without waking her. He steals softly over the
grass, careful to make no sound; he pauses—fancying she has stirred: he
withdraws: not for worlds would he be seen. All is still: he again
advances: he bends above her; a light veil rests on her features: he
lifts it, bends lower; now his eyes anticipate the vision of
beauty—warm, and blooming, and lovely, in rest. How hurried was their
first glance! But how they fix! How he starts! How he suddenly and
vehemently clasps in both arms the form he dared not, a moment since,
touch with his finger! How he calls aloud a name, and drops his burden,
and gazes on it wildly! He thus grasps and cries, and gazes, because he
no longer fears to waken by any sound he can utter—by any movement he
can make. He thought his love slept sweetly: he finds she is stone
dead.

I looked with timorous joy towards a stately house: I saw a blackened
ruin.

No need to cower behind a gate-post, indeed!—to peep up at chamber
lattices, fearing life was astir behind them! No need to listen for
doors opening—to fancy steps on the pavement or the gravel-walk! The
lawn, the grounds were trodden and waste: the portal yawned void. The
front was, as I had once seen it in a dream, but a shell-like wall,
very high and very fragile-looking, perforated with paneless windows:
no roof, no battlements, no chimneys—all had crashed in.

And there was the silence of death about it: the solitude of a lonesome
wild. No wonder that letters addressed to people here had never
received an answer: as well despatch epistles to a vault in a church
aisle. The grim blackness of the stones told by what fate the Hall had
fallen—by conflagration: but how kindled? What story belonged to this
disaster? What loss, besides mortar and marble and wood-work had
followed upon it? Had life been wrecked as well as property? If so,
whose? Dreadful question: there was no one here to answer it—not even
dumb sign, mute token.

In wandering round the shattered walls and through the devastated
interior, I gathered evidence that the calamity was not of late
occurrence. Winter snows, I thought, had drifted through that void
arch, winter rains beaten in at those hollow casements; for, amidst the
drenched piles of rubbish, spring had cherished vegetation: grass and
weed grew here and there between the stones and fallen rafters. And oh!
where meantime was the hapless owner of this wreck? In what land? Under
what auspices? My eye involuntarily wandered to the grey church tower
near the gates, and I asked, “Is he with Damer de Rochester, sharing
the shelter of his narrow marble house?”

Some answer must be had to these questions. I could find it nowhere but
at the inn, and thither, ere long, I returned. The host himself brought
my breakfast into the parlour. I requested him to shut the door and sit
down: I had some questions to ask him. But when he complied, I scarcely
knew how to begin; such horror had I of the possible answers. And yet
the spectacle of desolation I had just left prepared me in a measure
for a tale of misery. The host was a respectable-looking, middle-aged
man.

“You know Thornfield Hall, of course?” I managed to say at last.

“Yes, ma’am; I lived there once.”

“Did you?” Not in my time, I thought: you are a stranger to me.

“I was the late Mr. Rochester’s butler,” he added.

The late! I seem to have received, with full force, the blow I had been
trying to evade.

“The late!” I gasped. “Is he dead?”

“I mean the present gentleman, Mr. Edward’s father,” he explained. I
breathed again: my blood resumed its flow. Fully assured by these words
that Mr. Edward—_my_ Mr. Rochester (God bless him, wherever he
was!)—was at least alive: was, in short, “the present gentleman.”
Gladdening words! It seemed I could hear all that was to come—whatever
the disclosures might be—with comparative tranquillity. Since he was
not in the grave, I could bear, I thought, to learn that he was at the
Antipodes.

“Is Mr. Rochester living at Thornfield Hall now?” I asked, knowing, of
course, what the answer would be, but yet desirous of deferring the
direct question as to where he really was.

“No, ma’am—oh, no! No one is living there. I suppose you are a stranger
in these parts, or you would have heard what happened last
autumn,—Thornfield Hall is quite a ruin: it was burnt down just about
harvest-time. A dreadful calamity! such an immense quantity of valuable
property destroyed: hardly any of the furniture could be saved. The
fire broke out at dead of night, and before the engines arrived from
Millcote, the building was one mass of flame. It was a terrible
spectacle: I witnessed it myself.”

“At dead of night!” I muttered. Yes, that was ever the hour of fatality
at Thornfield. “Was it known how it originated?” I demanded.

“They guessed, ma’am: they guessed. Indeed, I should say it was
ascertained beyond a doubt. You are not perhaps aware,” he continued,
edging his chair a little nearer the table, and speaking low, “that
there was a lady—a—a lunatic, kept in the house?”

“I have heard something of it.”

“She was kept in very close confinement, ma’am; people even for some
years was not absolutely certain of her existence. No one saw her: they
only knew by rumour that such a person was at the Hall; and who or what
she was it was difficult to conjecture. They said Mr. Edward had
brought her from abroad, and some believed she had been his mistress.
But a queer thing happened a year since—a very queer thing.”

I feared now to hear my own story. I endeavoured to recall him to the
main fact.

“And this lady?”

“This lady, ma’am,” he answered, “turned out to be Mr. Rochester’s
wife! The discovery was brought about in the strangest way. There was a
young lady, a governess at the Hall, that Mr. Rochester fell in—”

“But the fire,” I suggested.

“I’m coming to that, ma’am—that Mr. Edward fell in love with. The
servants say they never saw anybody so much in love as he was: he was
after her continually. They used to watch him—servants will, you know,
ma’am—and he set store on her past everything: for all, nobody but him
thought her so very handsome. She was a little small thing, they say,
almost like a child. I never saw her myself; but I’ve heard Leah, the
house-maid, tell of her. Leah liked her well enough. Mr. Rochester was
about forty, and this governess not twenty; and you see, when gentlemen
of his age fall in love with girls, they are often like as if they were
bewitched. Well, he would marry her.”

“You shall tell me this part of the story another time,” I said; “but
now I have a particular reason for wishing to hear all about the fire.
Was it suspected that this lunatic, Mrs. Rochester, had any hand in
it?”

“You’ve hit it, ma’am: it’s quite certain that it was her, and nobody
but her, that set it going. She had a woman to take care of her called
Mrs. Poole—an able woman in her line, and very trustworthy, but for one
fault—a fault common to a deal of them nurses and matrons—_she kept a
private bottle of gin by her_, and now and then took a drop over-much.
It is excusable, for she had a hard life of it: but still it was
dangerous; for when Mrs. Poole was fast asleep after the gin and water,
the mad lady, who was as cunning as a witch, would take the keys out of
her pocket, let herself out of her chamber, and go roaming about the
house, doing any wild mischief that came into her head. They say she
had nearly burnt her husband in his bed once: but I don’t know about
that. However, on this night, she set fire first to the hangings of the
room next her own, and then she got down to a lower storey, and made
her way to the chamber that had been the governess’s—(she was like as
if she knew somehow how matters had gone on, and had a spite at
her)—and she kindled the bed there; but there was nobody sleeping in
it, fortunately. The governess had run away two months before; and for
all Mr. Rochester sought her as if she had been the most precious thing
he had in the world, he never could hear a word of her; and he grew
savage—quite savage on his disappointment: he never was a wild man, but
he got dangerous after he lost her. He would be alone, too. He sent
Mrs. Fairfax, the housekeeper, away to her friends at a distance; but
he did it handsomely, for he settled an annuity on her for life: and
she deserved it—she was a very good woman. Miss Adèle, a ward he had,
was put to school. He broke off acquaintance with all the gentry, and
shut himself up like a hermit at the Hall.”

“What! did he not leave England?”

“Leave England? Bless you, no! He would not cross the door-stones of
the house, except at night, when he walked just like a ghost about the
grounds and in the orchard as if he had lost his senses—which it is my
opinion he had; for a more spirited, bolder, keener gentleman than he
was before that midge of a governess crossed him, you never saw, ma’am.
He was not a man given to wine, or cards, or racing, as some are, and
he was not so very handsome; but he had a courage and a will of his
own, if ever man had. I knew him from a boy, you see: and for my part,
I have often wished that Miss Eyre had been sunk in the sea before she
came to Thornfield Hall.”

“Then Mr. Rochester was at home when the fire broke out?”

“Yes, indeed was he; and he went up to the attics when all was burning
above and below, and got the servants out of their beds and helped them
down himself, and went back to get his mad wife out of her cell. And
then they called out to him that she was on the roof, where she was
standing, waving her arms, above the battlements, and shouting out till
they could hear her a mile off: I saw her and heard her with my own
eyes. She was a big woman, and had long black hair: we could see it
streaming against the flames as she stood. I witnessed, and several
more witnessed, Mr. Rochester ascend through the sky-light on to the
roof; we heard him call ‘Bertha!’ We saw him approach her; and then,
ma’am, she yelled and gave a spring, and the next minute she lay
smashed on the pavement.”


The next minute she lay smashed on the pavement

“Dead?”

“Dead! Ay, dead as the stones on which her brains and blood were
scattered.”

“Good God!”

“You may well say so, ma’am: it was frightful!”

He shuddered.

“And afterwards?” I urged.

“Well, ma’am, afterwards the house was burnt to the ground: there are
only some bits of walls standing now.”

“Were any other lives lost?”

“No—perhaps it would have been better if there had.”

“What do you mean?”

“Poor Mr. Edward!” he ejaculated, “I little thought ever to have seen
it! Some say it was a just judgment on him for keeping his first
marriage secret, and wanting to take another wife while he had one
living: but I pity him, for my part.”

“You said he was alive?” I exclaimed.

“Yes, yes: he is alive; but many think he had better be dead.”

“Why? How?” My blood was again running cold. “Where is he?” I demanded.
“Is he in England?”

“Ay—ay—he’s in England; he can’t get out of England, I fancy—he’s a
fixture now.”

What agony was this! And the man seemed resolved to protract it.

“He is stone-blind,” he said at last. “Yes, he is stone-blind, is Mr.
Edward.”

I had dreaded worse. I had dreaded he was mad. I summoned strength to
ask what had caused this calamity.

“It was all his own courage, and a body may say, his kindness, in a
way, ma’am: he wouldn’t leave the house till every one else was out
before him. As he came down the great staircase at last, after Mrs.
Rochester had flung herself from the battlements, there was a great
crash—all fell. He was taken out from under the ruins, alive, but sadly
hurt: a beam had fallen in such a way as to protect him partly; but one
eye was knocked out, and one hand so crushed that Mr. Carter, the
surgeon, had to amputate it directly. The other eye inflamed: he lost
the sight of that also. He is now helpless, indeed—blind and a
cripple.”

“Where is he? Where does he now live?”

“At Ferndean, a manor-house on a farm he has, about thirty miles off:
quite a desolate spot.”

“Who is with him?”

“Old John and his wife: he would have none else. He is quite broken
down, they say.”

“Have you any sort of conveyance?”

“We have a chaise, ma’am, a very handsome chaise.”

“Let it be got ready instantly; and if your post-boy can drive me to
Ferndean before dark this day, I’ll pay both you and him twice the hire
you usually demand.”




CHAPTER XXXVII


The manor-house of Ferndean was a building of considerable antiquity,
moderate size, and no architectural pretensions, deep buried in a wood.
I had heard of it before. Mr. Rochester often spoke of it, and
sometimes went there. His father had purchased the estate for the sake
of the game covers. He would have let the house, but could find no
tenant, in consequence of its ineligible and insalubrious site.
Ferndean then remained uninhabited and unfurnished, with the exception
of some two or three rooms fitted up for the accommodation of the
squire when he went there in the season to shoot.

To this house I came just ere dark on an evening marked by the
characteristics of sad sky, cold gale, and continued small penetrating
rain. The last mile I performed on foot, having dismissed the chaise
and driver with the double remuneration I had promised. Even when
within a very short distance of the manor-house, you could see nothing
of it, so thick and dark grew the timber of the gloomy wood about it.
Iron gates between granite pillars showed me where to enter, and
passing through them, I found myself at once in the twilight of
close-ranked trees. There was a grass-grown track descending the forest
aisle between hoar and knotty shafts and under branched arches. I
followed it, expecting soon to reach the dwelling; but it stretched on
and on, it wound far and farther: no sign of habitation or grounds was
visible.

I thought I had taken a wrong direction and lost my way. The darkness
of natural as well as of sylvan dusk gathered over me. I looked round
in search of another road. There was none: all was interwoven stem,
columnar trunk, dense summer foliage—no opening anywhere.

I proceeded: at last my way opened, the trees thinned a little;
presently I beheld a railing, then the house—scarce, by this dim light,
distinguishable from the trees; so dank and green were its decaying
walls. Entering a portal, fastened only by a latch, I stood amidst a
space of enclosed ground, from which the wood swept away in a
semicircle. There were no flowers, no garden-beds; only a broad
gravel-walk girdling a grass-plat, and this set in the heavy frame of
the forest. The house presented two pointed gables in its front; the
windows were latticed and narrow: the front door was narrow too, one
step led up to it. The whole looked, as the host of the Rochester Arms
had said, “quite a desolate spot.” It was as still as a church on a
week-day: the pattering rain on the forest leaves was the only sound
audible in its vicinage.

“Can there be life here?” I asked.

Yes, life of some kind there was; for I heard a movement—that narrow
front-door was unclosing, and some shape was about to issue from the
grange.

It opened slowly: a figure came out into the twilight and stood on the
step; a man without a hat: he stretched forth his hand as if to feel
whether it rained. Dusk as it was, I had recognised him—it was my
master, Edward Fairfax Rochester, and no other.

I stayed my step, almost my breath, and stood to watch him—to examine
him, myself unseen, and alas! to him invisible. It was a sudden
meeting, and one in which rapture was kept well in check by pain. I had
no difficulty in restraining my voice from exclamation, my step from
hasty advance.

His form was of the same strong and stalwart contour as ever: his port
was still erect, his hair was still raven black; nor were his features
altered or sunk: not in one year’s space, by any sorrow, could his
athletic strength be quelled or his vigorous prime blighted. But in his
countenance I saw a change: that looked desperate and brooding—that
reminded me of some wronged and fettered wild beast or bird, dangerous
to approach in his sullen woe. The caged eagle, whose gold-ringed eyes
cruelty has extinguished, might look as looked that sightless Samson.

And, reader, do you think I feared him in his blind ferocity?—if you
do, you little know me. A soft hope blent with my sorrow that soon I
should dare to drop a kiss on that brow of rock, and on those lips so
sternly sealed beneath it: but not yet. I would not accost him yet.

He descended the one step, and advanced slowly and gropingly towards
the grass-plat. Where was his daring stride now? Then he paused, as if
he knew not which way to turn. He lifted his hand and opened his
eyelids; gazed blank, and with a straining effort, on the sky, and
toward the amphitheatre of trees: one saw that all to him was void
darkness. He stretched his right hand (the left arm, the mutilated one,
he kept hidden in his bosom); he seemed to wish by touch to gain an
idea of what lay around him: he met but vacancy still; for the trees
were some yards off where he stood. He relinquished the endeavour,
folded his arms, and stood quiet and mute in the rain, now falling fast
on his uncovered head. At this moment John approached him from some
quarter.

“Will you take my arm, sir?” he said; “there is a heavy shower coming
on: had you not better go in?”

“Let me alone,” was the answer.

John withdrew without having observed me. Mr. Rochester now tried to
walk about: vainly,—all was too uncertain. He groped his way back to
the house, and, re-entering it, closed the door.

I now drew near and knocked: John’s wife opened for me. “Mary,” I said,
“how are you?”

She started as if she had seen a ghost: I calmed her. To her hurried
“Is it really you, miss, come at this late hour to this lonely place?”
I answered by taking her hand; and then I followed her into the
kitchen, where John now sat by a good fire. I explained to them, in few
words, that I had heard all which had happened since I left Thornfield,
and that I was come to see Mr. Rochester. I asked John to go down to
the turn-pike-house, where I had dismissed the chaise, and bring my
trunk, which I had left there: and then, while I removed my bonnet and
shawl, I questioned Mary as to whether I could be accommodated at the
Manor House for the night; and finding that arrangements to that
effect, though difficult, would not be impossible, I informed her I
should stay. Just at this moment the parlour-bell rang.

“When you go in,” said I, “tell your master that a person wishes to
speak to him, but do not give my name.”

“I don’t think he will see you,” she answered; “he refuses everybody.”

When she returned, I inquired what he had said.

“You are to send in your name and your business,” she replied. She then
proceeded to fill a glass with water, and place it on a tray, together
with candles.

“Is that what he rang for?” I asked.

“Yes: he always has candles brought in at dark, though he is blind.”

“Give the tray to me; I will carry it in.”

I took it from her hand: she pointed me out the parlour door. The tray
shook as I held it; the water spilt from the glass; my heart struck my
ribs loud and fast. Mary opened the door for me, and shut it behind me.

This parlour looked gloomy: a neglected handful of fire burnt low in
the grate; and, leaning over it, with his head supported against the
high, old-fashioned mantelpiece, appeared the blind tenant of the room.
His old dog, Pilot, lay on one side, removed out of the way, and coiled
up as if afraid of being inadvertently trodden upon. Pilot pricked up
his ears when I came in: then he jumped up with a yelp and a whine, and
bounded towards me: he almost knocked the tray from my hands. I set it
on the table; then patted him, and said softly, “Lie down!” Mr.
Rochester turned mechanically to _see_ what the commotion was: but as
he _saw_ nothing, he returned and sighed.

“Give me the water, Mary,” he said.

I approached him with the now only half-filled glass; Pilot followed
me, still excited.

“What is the matter?” he inquired.

“Down, Pilot!” I again said. He checked the water on its way to his
lips, and seemed to listen: he drank, and put the glass down. “This is
you, Mary, is it not?”

“Mary is in the kitchen,” I answered.

He put out his hand with a quick gesture, but not seeing where I stood,
he did not touch me. “Who is this? Who is this?” he demanded, trying,
as it seemed, to _see_ with those sightless eyes—unavailing and
distressing attempt! “Answer me—speak again!” he ordered, imperiously
and aloud.

“Will you have a little more water, sir? I spilt half of what was in
the glass,” I said.

“_Who_ is it? _What_ is it? Who speaks?”

“Pilot knows me, and John and Mary know I am here. I came only this
evening,” I answered.

“Great God!—what delusion has come over me? What sweet madness has
seized me?”

“No delusion—no madness: your mind, sir, is too strong for delusion,
your health too sound for frenzy.”

“And where is the speaker? Is it only a voice? Oh! I _cannot_ see, but
I must feel, or my heart will stop and my brain burst. Whatever—whoever
you are—be perceptible to the touch or I cannot live!”

He groped; I arrested his wandering hand, and prisoned it in both mine.

“Her very fingers!” he cried; “her small, slight fingers! If so there
must be more of her.”

The muscular hand broke from my custody; my arm was seized, my
shoulder—neck—waist—I was entwined and gathered to him.

“Is it Jane? _What_ is it? This is her shape—this is her size—”

“And this her voice,” I added. “She is all here: her heart, too. God
bless you, sir! I am glad to be so near you again.”

“Jane Eyre!—Jane Eyre,” was all he said.

“My dear master,” I answered, “I am Jane Eyre: I have found you out—I
am come back to you.”

“In truth?—in the flesh? My living Jane?”

“You touch me, sir,—you hold me, and fast enough: I am not cold like a
corpse, nor vacant like air, am I?”

“My living darling! These are certainly her limbs, and these her
features; but I cannot be so blest, after all my misery. It is a dream;
such dreams as I have had at night when I have clasped her once more to
my heart, as I do now; and kissed her, as thus—and felt that she loved
me, and trusted that she would not leave me.”

“Which I never will, sir, from this day.”

“Never will, says the vision? But I always woke and found it an empty
mockery; and I was desolate and abandoned—my life dark, lonely,
hopeless—my soul athirst and forbidden to drink—my heart famished and
never to be fed. Gentle, soft dream, nestling in my arms now, you will
fly, too, as your sisters have all fled before you: but kiss me before
you go—embrace me, Jane.”

“There, sir—and there!”’

I pressed my lips to his once brilliant and now rayless eyes—I swept
his hair from his brow, and kissed that too. He suddenly seemed to
arouse himself: the conviction of the reality of all this seized him.

“It is you—is it, Jane? You are come back to me then?”

“I am.”

“And you do not lie dead in some ditch under some stream? And you are
not a pining outcast amongst strangers?”

“No, sir! I am an independent woman now.”

“Independent! What do you mean, Jane?”

“My uncle in Madeira is dead, and he left me five thousand pounds.”

“Ah! this is practical—this is real!” he cried: “I should never dream
that. Besides, there is that peculiar voice of hers, so animating and
piquant, as well as soft: it cheers my withered heart; it puts life
into it.—What, Janet! Are you an independent woman? A rich woman?”

“Quite rich, sir. If you won’t let me live with you, I can build a
house of my own close up to your door, and you may come and sit in my
parlour when you want company of an evening.”

“But as you are rich, Jane, you have now, no doubt, friends who will
look after you, and not suffer you to devote yourself to a blind
lameter like me?”

“I told you I am independent, sir, as well as rich: I am my own
mistress.”

“And you will stay with me?”

“Certainly—unless you object. I will be your neighbour, your nurse,
your housekeeper. I find you lonely: I will be your companion—to read
to you, to walk with you, to sit with you, to wait on you, to be eyes
and hands to you. Cease to look so melancholy, my dear master; you
shall not be left desolate, so long as I live.”

He replied not: he seemed serious—abstracted; he sighed; he half-opened
his lips as if to speak: he closed them again. I felt a little
embarrassed. Perhaps I had too rashly over-leaped conventionalities;
and he, like St. John, saw impropriety in my inconsiderateness. I had
indeed made my proposal from the idea that he wished and would ask me
to be his wife: an expectation, not the less certain because
unexpressed, had buoyed me up, that he would claim me at once as his
own. But no hint to that effect escaping him and his countenance
becoming more overcast, I suddenly remembered that I might have been
all wrong, and was perhaps playing the fool unwittingly; and I began
gently to withdraw myself from his arms—but he eagerly snatched me
closer.

“No—no—Jane; you must not go. No—I have touched you, heard you, felt
the comfort of your presence—the sweetness of your consolation: I
cannot give up these joys. I have little left in myself—I must have
you. The world may laugh—may call me absurd, selfish—but it does not
signify. My very soul demands you: it will be satisfied, or it will
take deadly vengeance on its frame.”

“Well, sir, I will stay with you: I have said so.”

“Yes—but you understand one thing by staying with me; and I understand
another. You, perhaps, could make up your mind to be about my hand and
chair—to wait on me as a kind little nurse (for you have an
affectionate heart and a generous spirit, which prompt you to make
sacrifices for those you pity), and that ought to suffice for me no
doubt. I suppose I should now entertain none but fatherly feelings for
you: do you think so? Come—tell me.”

“I will think what you like, sir: I am content to be only your nurse,
if you think it better.”

“But you cannot always be my nurse, Janet: you are young—you must marry
one day.”

“I don’t care about being married.”

“You should care, Janet: if I were what I once was, I would try to make
you care—but—a sightless block!”

He relapsed again into gloom. I, on the contrary, became more cheerful,
and took fresh courage: these last words gave me an insight as to where
the difficulty lay; and as it was no difficulty with me, I felt quite
relieved from my previous embarrassment. I resumed a livelier vein of
conversation.

“It is time some one undertook to rehumanise you,” said I, parting his
thick and long uncut locks; “for I see you are being metamorphosed into
a lion, or something of that sort. You have a ‘faux air’ of
Nebuchadnezzar in the fields about you, that is certain: your hair
reminds me of eagles’ feathers; whether your nails are grown like
birds’ claws or not, I have not yet noticed.”

“On this arm, I have neither hand nor nails,” he said, drawing the
mutilated limb from his breast, and showing it to me. “It is a mere
stump—a ghastly sight! Don’t you think so, Jane?”

“It is a pity to see it; and a pity to see your eyes—and the scar of
fire on your forehead: and the worst of it is, one is in danger of
loving you too well for all this; and making too much of you.”

“I thought you would be revolted, Jane, when you saw my arm, and my
cicatrised visage.”

“Did you? Don’t tell me so—lest I should say something disparaging to
your judgment. Now, let me leave you an instant, to make a better fire,
and have the hearth swept up. Can you tell when there is a good fire?”

“Yes; with the right eye I see a glow—a ruddy haze.”

“And you see the candles?”

“Very dimly—each is a luminous cloud.”

“Can you see me?”

“No, my fairy: but I am only too thankful to hear and feel you.”

“When do you take supper?”

“I never take supper.”

“But you shall have some to-night. I am hungry: so are you, I daresay,
only you forget.”

Summoning Mary, I soon had the room in more cheerful order: I prepared
him, likewise, a comfortable repast. My spirits were excited, and with
pleasure and ease I talked to him during supper, and for a long time
after. There was no harassing restraint, no repressing of glee and
vivacity with him; for with him I was at perfect ease, because I knew I
suited him; all I said or did seemed either to console or revive him.
Delightful consciousness! It brought to life and light my whole nature:
in his presence I thoroughly lived; and he lived in mine. Blind as he
was, smiles played over his face, joy dawned on his forehead: his
lineaments softened and warmed.

After supper, he began to ask me many questions, of where I had been,
what I had been doing, how I had found him out; but I gave him only
very partial replies: it was too late to enter into particulars that
night. Besides, I wished to touch no deep-thrilling chord—to open no
fresh well of emotion in his heart: my sole present aim was to cheer
him. Cheered, as I have said, he was: and yet but by fits. If a
moment’s silence broke the conversation, he would turn restless, touch
me, then say, “Jane.”

“You are altogether a human being, Jane? You are certain of that?”


You are altogether a human being, Jane? You are certain of that?

“I conscientiously believe so, Mr. Rochester.”

“Yet how, on this dark and doleful evening, could you so suddenly rise
on my lone hearth? I stretched my hand to take a glass of water from a
hireling, and it was given me by you: I asked a question, expecting
John’s wife to answer me, and your voice spoke at my ear.”

“Because I had come in, in Mary’s stead, with the tray.”

“And there is enchantment in the very hour I am now spending with you.
Who can tell what a dark, dreary, hopeless life I have dragged on for
months past? Doing nothing, expecting nothing; merging night in day;
feeling but the sensation of cold when I let the fire go out, of hunger
when I forgot to eat: and then a ceaseless sorrow, and, at times, a
very delirium of desire to behold my Jane again. Yes: for her
restoration I longed, far more than for that of my lost sight. How can
it be that Jane is with me, and says she loves me? Will she not depart
as suddenly as she came? To-morrow, I fear I shall find her no more.”

A commonplace, practical reply, out of the train of his own disturbed
ideas, was, I was sure, the best and most reassuring for him in this
frame of mind. I passed my finger over his eyebrows, and remarked that
they were scorched, and that I would apply something which would make
them grow as broad and black as ever.

“Where is the use of doing me good in any way, beneficent spirit, when,
at some fatal moment, you will again desert me—passing like a shadow,
whither and how to me unknown, and for me remaining afterwards
undiscoverable?”

“Have you a pocket-comb about you, sir?”

“What for, Jane?”

“Just to comb out this shaggy black mane. I find you rather alarming,
when I examine you close at hand: you talk of my being a fairy, but I
am sure, you are more like a brownie.”

“Am I hideous, Jane?”

“Very, sir: you always were, you know.”

“Humph! The wickedness has not been taken out of you, wherever you have
sojourned.”

“Yet I have been with good people; far better than you: a hundred times
better people; possessed of ideas and views you never entertained in
your life: quite more refined and exalted.”

“Who the deuce have you been with?”

“If you twist in that way you will make me pull the hair out of your
head; and then I think you will cease to entertain doubts of my
substantiality.”

“Who have you been with, Jane?”

“You shall not get it out of me to-night, sir; you must wait till
to-morrow; to leave my tale half told, will, you know, be a sort of
security that I shall appear at your breakfast table to finish it. By
the bye, I must mind not to rise on your hearth with only a glass of
water then: I must bring an egg at the least, to say nothing of fried
ham.”

“You mocking changeling—fairy-born and human-bred! You make me feel as
I have not felt these twelve months. If Saul could have had you for his
David, the evil spirit would have been exorcised without the aid of the
harp.”

“There, sir, you are redd up and made decent. Now I’ll leave you: I
have been travelling these last three days, and I believe I am tired.
Good night.”

“Just one word, Jane: were there only ladies in the house where you
have been?”

I laughed and made my escape, still laughing as I ran upstairs. “A good
idea!” I thought with glee. “I see I have the means of fretting him out
of his melancholy for some time to come.”

Very early the next morning I heard him up and astir, wandering from
one room to another. As soon as Mary came down I heard the question:
“Is Miss Eyre here?” Then: “Which room did you put her into? Was it
dry? Is she up? Go and ask if she wants anything; and when she will
come down.”

I came down as soon as I thought there was a prospect of breakfast.
Entering the room very softly, I had a view of him before he discovered
my presence. It was mournful, indeed, to witness the subjugation of
that vigorous spirit to a corporeal infirmity. He sat in his
chair—still, but not at rest: expectant evidently; the lines of now
habitual sadness marking his strong features. His countenance reminded
one of a lamp quenched, waiting to be re-lit—and alas! it was not
himself that could now kindle the lustre of animated expression: he was
dependent on another for that office! I had meant to be gay and
careless, but the powerlessness of the strong man touched my heart to
the quick: still I accosted him with what vivacity I could.

“It is a bright, sunny morning, sir,” I said. “The rain is over and
gone, and there is a tender shining after it: you shall have a walk
soon.”

I had wakened the glow: his features beamed.

“Oh, you are indeed there, my skylark! Come to me. You are not gone:
not vanished? I heard one of your kind an hour ago, singing high over
the wood: but its song had no music for me, any more than the rising
sun had rays. All the melody on earth is concentrated in my Jane’s
tongue to my ear (I am glad it is not naturally a silent one): all the
sunshine I can feel is in her presence.”

The water stood in my eyes to hear this avowal of his dependence; just
as if a royal eagle, chained to a perch, should be forced to entreat a
sparrow to become its purveyor. But I would not be lachrymose: I dashed
off the salt drops, and busied myself with preparing breakfast.

Most of the morning was spent in the open air. I led him out of the wet
and wild wood into some cheerful fields: I described to him how
brilliantly green they were; how the flowers and hedges looked
refreshed; how sparklingly blue was the sky. I sought a seat for him in
a hidden and lovely spot, a dry stump of a tree; nor did I refuse to
let him, when seated, place me on his knee. Why should I, when both he
and I were happier near than apart? Pilot lay beside us: all was quiet.
He broke out suddenly while clasping me in his arms—

“Cruel, cruel deserter! Oh, Jane, what did I feel when I discovered you
had fled from Thornfield, and when I could nowhere find you; and, after
examining your apartment, ascertained that you had taken no money, nor
anything which could serve as an equivalent! A pearl necklace I had
given you lay untouched in its little casket; your trunks were left
corded and locked as they had been prepared for the bridal tour. What
could my darling do, I asked, left destitute and penniless? And what
did she do? Let me hear now.”

Thus urged, I began the narrative of my experience for the last year. I
softened considerably what related to the three days of wandering and
starvation, because to have told him all would have been to inflict
unnecessary pain: the little I did say lacerated his faithful heart
deeper than I wished.

I should not have left him thus, he said, without any means of making
my way: I should have told him my intention. I should have confided in
him: he would never have forced me to be his mistress. Violent as he
had seemed in his despair, he, in truth, loved me far too well and too
tenderly to constitute himself my tyrant: he would have given me half
his fortune, without demanding so much as a kiss in return, rather than
I should have flung myself friendless on the wide world. I had endured,
he was certain, more than I had confessed to him.

“Well, whatever my sufferings had been, they were very short,” I
answered: and then I proceeded to tell him how I had been received at
Moor House; how I had obtained the office of schoolmistress, &c. The
accession of fortune, the discovery of my relations, followed in due
order. Of course, St. John Rivers’ name came in frequently in the
progress of my tale. When I had done, that name was immediately taken
up.

“This St. John, then, is your cousin?”

“Yes.”

“You have spoken of him often: do you like him?”

“He was a very good man, sir; I could not help liking him.”

“A good man. Does that mean a respectable well-conducted man of fifty?
Or what does it mean?”

“St John was only twenty-nine, sir.”

“‘_Jeune encore_,’ as the French say. Is he a person of low stature,
phlegmatic, and plain. A person whose goodness consists rather in his
guiltlessness of vice, than in his prowess in virtue.”

“He is untiringly active. Great and exalted deeds are what he lives to
perform.”

“But his brain? That is probably rather soft? He means well: but you
shrug your shoulders to hear him talk?”

“He talks little, sir: what he does say is ever to the point. His brain
is first-rate, I should think not impressible, but vigorous.”

“Is he an able man, then?”

“Truly able.”

“A thoroughly educated man?”

“St. John is an accomplished and profound scholar.”

“His manners, I think, you said are not to your taste?—priggish and
parsonic?”

“I never mentioned his manners; but, unless I had a very bad taste,
they must suit it; they are polished, calm, and gentlemanlike.”

“His appearance,—I forget what description you gave of his
appearance;—a sort of raw curate, half strangled with his white
neckcloth, and stilted up on his thick-soled high-lows, eh?”

“St. John dresses well. He is a handsome man: tall, fair, with blue
eyes, and a Grecian profile.”

(Aside.) “Damn him!”—(To me.) “Did you like him, Jane?”

“Yes, Mr. Rochester, I liked him: but you asked me that before.”

I perceived, of course, the drift of my interlocutor. Jealousy had got
hold of him: she stung him; but the sting was salutary: it gave him
respite from the gnawing fang of melancholy. I would not, therefore,
immediately charm the snake.

“Perhaps you would rather not sit any longer on my knee, Miss Eyre?”
was the next somewhat unexpected observation.

“Why not, Mr. Rochester?”

“The picture you have just drawn is suggestive of a rather too
overwhelming contrast. Your words have delineated very prettily a
graceful Apollo: he is present to your imagination,—tall, fair,
blue-eyed, and with a Grecian profile. Your eyes dwell on a Vulcan,—a
real blacksmith, brown, broad-shouldered: and blind and lame into the
bargain.”

“I never thought of it, before; but you certainly are rather like
Vulcan, sir.”

“Well, you can leave me, ma’am: but before you go” (and he retained me
by a firmer grasp than ever), “you will be pleased just to answer me a
question or two.” He paused.

“What questions, Mr. Rochester?”

Then followed this cross-examination.

“St. John made you schoolmistress of Morton before he knew you were his
cousin?”

“Yes.”

“You would often see him? He would visit the school sometimes?”

“Daily.”

“He would approve of your plans, Jane? I know they would be clever, for
you are a talented creature!”

“He approved of them—yes.”

“He would discover many things in you he could not have expected to
find? Some of your accomplishments are not ordinary.”

“I don’t know about that.”

“You had a little cottage near the school, you say: did he ever come
there to see you?”

“Now and then?”

“Of an evening?”

“Once or twice.”

A pause.

“How long did you reside with him and his sisters after the cousinship
was discovered?”

“Five months.”

“Did Rivers spend much time with the ladies of his family?”

“Yes; the back parlour was both his study and ours: he sat near the
window, and we by the table.”

“Did he study much?”

“A good deal.”

“What?”

“Hindostanee.”

“And what did you do meantime?”

“I learnt German, at first.”

“Did he teach you?”

“He did not understand German.”

“Did he teach you nothing?”

“A little Hindostanee.”

“Rivers taught you Hindostanee?”

“Yes, sir.”

“And his sisters also?”

“No.”

“Only you?”

“Only me.”

“Did you ask to learn?”

“No.”

“He wished to teach you?”

“Yes.”

A second pause.

“Why did he wish it? Of what use could Hindostanee be to you?”

“He intended me to go with him to India.”

“Ah! here I reach the root of the matter. He wanted you to marry him?”

“He asked me to marry him.”

“That is a fiction—an impudent invention to vex me.”

“I beg your pardon, it is the literal truth: he asked me more than
once, and was as stiff about urging his point as ever you could be.”

“Miss Eyre, I repeat it, you can leave me. How often am I to say the
same thing? Why do you remain pertinaciously perched on my knee, when I
have given you notice to quit?”

“Because I am comfortable there.”

“No, Jane, you are not comfortable there, because your heart is not
with me: it is with this cousin—this St. John. Oh, till this moment, I
thought my little Jane was all mine! I had a belief she loved me even
when she left me: that was an atom of sweet in much bitter. Long as we
have been parted, hot tears as I have wept over our separation, I never
thought that while I was mourning her, she was loving another! But it
is useless grieving. Jane, leave me: go and marry Rivers.”

“Shake me off, then, sir,—push me away, for I’ll not leave you of my
own accord.”

“Jane, I ever like your tone of voice: it still renews hope, it sounds
so truthful. When I hear it, it carries me back a year. I forget that
you have formed a new tie. But I am not a fool—go—”

“Where must I go, sir?”

“Your own way—with the husband you have chosen.”

“Who is that?”

“You know—this St. John Rivers.”

“He is not my husband, nor ever will be. He does not love me: I do not
love him. He loves (as he _can_ love, and that is not as you love) a
beautiful young lady called Rosamond. He wanted to marry me only
because he thought I should make a suitable missionary’s wife, which
she would not have done. He is good and great, but severe; and, for me,
cold as an iceberg. He is not like you, sir: I am not happy at his
side, nor near him, nor with him. He has no indulgence for me—no
fondness. He sees nothing attractive in me; not even youth—only a few
useful mental points.—Then I must leave you, sir, to go to him?”

I shuddered involuntarily, and clung instinctively closer to my blind
but beloved master. He smiled.

“What, Jane! Is this true? Is such really the state of matters between
you and Rivers?”

“Absolutely, sir! Oh, you need not be jealous! I wanted to tease you a
little to make you less sad: I thought anger would be better than
grief. But if you wish me to love you, could you but see how much I
_do_ love you, you would be proud and content. All my heart is yours,
sir: it belongs to you; and with you it would remain, were fate to
exile the rest of me from your presence for ever.”

Again, as he kissed me, painful thoughts darkened his aspect.

“My seared vision! My crippled strength!” he murmured regretfully.

I caressed, in order to soothe him. I knew of what he was thinking, and
wanted to speak for him, but dared not. As he turned aside his face a
minute, I saw a tear slide from under the sealed eyelid, and trickle
down the manly cheek. My heart swelled.

“I am no better than the old lightning-struck chestnut-tree in
Thornfield orchard,” he remarked ere long. “And what right would that
ruin have to bid a budding woodbine cover its decay with freshness?”

“You are no ruin, sir—no lightning-struck tree: you are green and
vigorous. Plants will grow about your roots, whether you ask them or
not, because they take delight in your bountiful shadow; and as they
grow they will lean towards you, and wind round you, because your
strength offers them so safe a prop.”

Again he smiled: I gave him comfort.

“You speak of friends, Jane?” he asked.

“Yes, of friends,” I answered rather hesitatingly: for I knew I meant
more than friends, but could not tell what other word to employ. He
helped me.

“Ah! Jane. But I want a wife.”

“Do you, sir?”

“Yes: is it news to you?”

“Of course: you said nothing about it before.”

“Is it unwelcome news?”

“That depends on circumstances, sir—on your choice.”

“Which you shall make for me, Jane. I will abide by your decision.”

“Choose then, sir—_her who loves you best_.”

“I will at least choose—_her I love best_. Jane, will you marry me?”

“Yes, sir.”

“A poor blind man, whom you will have to lead about by the hand?”

“Yes, sir.”

“A crippled man, twenty years older than you, whom you will have to
wait on?”

“Yes, sir.”

“Truly, Jane?”

“Most truly, sir.”

“Oh! my darling! God bless you and reward you!”

“Mr. Rochester, if ever I did a good deed in my life—if ever I thought
a good thought—if ever I prayed a sincere and blameless prayer—if ever
I wished a righteous wish,—I am rewarded now. To be your wife is, for
me, to be as happy as I can be on earth.”

“Because you delight in sacrifice.”

“Sacrifice! What do I sacrifice? Famine for food, expectation for
content. To be privileged to put my arms round what I value—to press my
lips to what I love—to repose on what I trust: is that to make a
sacrifice? If so, then certainly I delight in sacrifice.”

“And to bear with my infirmities, Jane: to overlook my deficiencies.”

“Which are none, sir, to me. I love you better now, when I can really
be useful to you, than I did in your state of proud independence, when
you disdained every part but that of the giver and protector.”

“Hitherto I have hated to be helped—to be led: henceforth, I feel I
shall hate it no more. I did not like to put my hand into a hireling’s,
but it is pleasant to feel it circled by Jane’s little fingers. I
preferred utter loneliness to the constant attendance of servants; but
Jane’s soft ministry will be a perpetual joy. Jane suits me: do I suit
her?”

“To the finest fibre of my nature, sir.”

“The case being so, we have nothing in the world to wait for: we must
be married instantly.”

He looked and spoke with eagerness: his old impetuosity was rising.

“We must become one flesh without any delay, Jane: there is but the
licence to get—then we marry.”

“Mr. Rochester, I have just discovered the sun is far declined from its
meridian, and Pilot is actually gone home to his dinner. Let me look at
your watch.”

“Fasten it into your girdle, Janet, and keep it henceforward: I have no
use for it.”

“It is nearly four o’clock in the afternoon, sir. Don’t you feel
hungry?”

“The third day from this must be our wedding-day, Jane. Never mind fine
clothes and jewels, now: all that is not worth a fillip.”

“The sun has dried up all the rain-drops, sir. The breeze is still: it
is quite hot.”

“Do you know, Jane, I have your little pearl necklace at this moment
fastened round my bronze scrag under my cravat? I have worn it since
the day I lost my only treasure, as a memento of her.”

“We will go home through the wood: that will be the shadiest way.”

He pursued his own thoughts without heeding me.

“Jane! you think me, I daresay, an irreligious dog: but my heart swells
with gratitude to the beneficent God of this earth just now. He sees
not as man sees, but far clearer: judges not as man judges, but far
more wisely. I did wrong: I would have sullied my innocent
flower—breathed guilt on its purity: the Omnipotent snatched it from
me. I, in my stiff-necked rebellion, almost cursed the dispensation:
instead of bending to the decree, I defied it. Divine justice pursued
its course; disasters came thick on me: I was forced to pass through
the valley of the shadow of death. _His_ chastisements are mighty; and
one smote me which has humbled me for ever. You know I was proud of my
strength: but what is it now, when I must give it over to foreign
guidance, as a child does its weakness? Of late, Jane—only—only of
late—I began to see and acknowledge the hand of God in my doom. I began
to experience remorse, repentance; the wish for reconcilement to my
Maker. I began sometimes to pray: very brief prayers they were, but
very sincere.

“Some days since: nay, I can number them—four; it was last Monday
night, a singular mood came over me: one in which grief replaced
frenzy—sorrow, sullenness. I had long had the impression that since I
could nowhere find you, you must be dead. Late that night—perhaps it
might be between eleven and twelve o’clock—ere I retired to my dreary
rest, I supplicated God, that, if it seemed good to Him, I might soon
be taken from this life, and admitted to that world to come, where
there was still hope of rejoining Jane.

“I was in my own room, and sitting by the window, which was open: it
soothed me to feel the balmy night-air; though I could see no stars and
only by a vague, luminous haze, knew the presence of a moon. I longed
for thee, Janet! Oh, I longed for thee both with soul and flesh! I
asked of God, at once in anguish and humility, if I had not been long
enough desolate, afflicted, tormented; and might not soon taste bliss
and peace once more. That I merited all I endured, I acknowledged—that
I could scarcely endure more, I pleaded; and the alpha and omega of my
heart’s wishes broke involuntarily from my lips in the words—‘Jane!
Jane! Jane!’”

“Did you speak these words aloud?”

“I did, Jane. If any listener had heard me, he would have thought me
mad: I pronounced them with such frantic energy.”

“And it was last Monday night, somewhere near midnight?”

“Yes; but the time is of no consequence: what followed is the strange
point. You will think me superstitious,—some superstition I have in my
blood, and always had: nevertheless, this is true—true at least it is
that I heard what I now relate.

“As I exclaimed ‘Jane! Jane! Jane!’ a voice—I cannot tell whence the
voice came, but I know whose voice it was—replied, ‘I am coming: wait
for me;’ and a moment after, went whispering on the wind the
words—‘Where are you?’

“I’ll tell you, if I can, the idea, the picture these words opened to
my mind: yet it is difficult to express what I want to express.
Ferndean is buried, as you see, in a heavy wood, where sound falls
dull, and dies unreverberating. ‘Where are you?’ seemed spoken amongst
mountains; for I heard a hill-sent echo repeat the words. Cooler and
fresher at the moment the gale seemed to visit my brow: I could have
deemed that in some wild, lone scene, I and Jane were meeting. In
spirit, I believe we must have met. You no doubt were, at that hour, in
unconscious sleep, Jane: perhaps your soul wandered from its cell to
comfort mine; for those were your accents—as certain as I live—they
were yours!”

Reader, it was on Monday night—near midnight—that I too had received
the mysterious summons: those were the very words by which I replied to
it. I listened to Mr. Rochester’s narrative, but made no disclosure in
return. The coincidence struck me as too awful and inexplicable to be
communicated or discussed. If I told anything, my tale would be such as
must necessarily make a profound impression on the mind of my hearer:
and that mind, yet from its sufferings too prone to gloom, needed not
the deeper shade of the supernatural. I kept these things then, and
pondered them in my heart.

“You cannot now wonder,” continued my master, “that when you rose upon
me so unexpectedly last night, I had difficulty in believing you any
other than a mere voice and vision, something that would melt to
silence and annihilation, as the midnight whisper and mountain echo had
melted before. Now, I thank God! I know it to be otherwise. Yes, I
thank God!”

He put me off his knee, rose, and reverently lifting his hat from his
brow, and bending his sightless eyes to the earth, he stood in mute
devotion. Only the last words of the worship were audible.

“I thank my Maker, that, in the midst of judgment, he has remembered
mercy. I humbly entreat my Redeemer to give me strength to lead
henceforth a purer life than I have done hitherto!”

Then he stretched his hand out to be led. I took that dear hand, held
it a moment to my lips, then let it pass round my shoulder: being so
much lower of stature than he, I served both for his prop and guide. We
entered the wood, and wended homeward.




CHAPTER XXXVIII—CONCLUSION


Reader, I married him. A quiet wedding we had: he and I, the parson and
clerk, were alone present. When we got back from church, I went into
the kitchen of the manor-house, where Mary was cooking the dinner and
John cleaning the knives, and I said—

“Mary, I have been married to Mr. Rochester this morning.” The
housekeeper and her husband were both of that decent phlegmatic order
of people, to whom one may at any time safely communicate a remarkable
piece of news without incurring the danger of having one’s ears pierced
by some shrill ejaculation, and subsequently stunned by a torrent of
wordy wonderment. Mary did look up, and she did stare at me: the ladle
with which she was basting a pair of chickens roasting at the fire, did
for some three minutes hang suspended in air; and for the same space of
time John’s knives also had rest from the polishing process: but Mary,
bending again over the roast, said only—

“Have you, Miss? Well, for sure!”

A short time after she pursued—“I seed you go out with the master, but
I didn’t know you were gone to church to be wed;” and she basted away.
John, when I turned to him, was grinning from ear to ear.

“I telled Mary how it would be,” he said: “I knew what Mr. Edward”
(John was an old servant, and had known his master when he was the
cadet of the house, therefore, he often gave him his Christian name)—“I
knew what Mr. Edward would do; and I was certain he would not wait long
neither: and he’s done right, for aught I know. I wish you joy, Miss!”
and he politely pulled his forelock.

“Thank you, John. Mr. Rochester told me to give you and Mary this.” I
put into his hand a five-pound note. Without waiting to hear more, I
left the kitchen. In passing the door of that sanctum some time after,
I caught the words—

“She’ll happen do better for him nor ony o’ t’ grand ladies.” And
again, “If she ben’t one o’ th’ handsomest, she’s noan faâl and varry
good-natured; and i’ his een she’s fair beautiful, onybody may see
that.”

I wrote to Moor House and to Cambridge immediately, to say what I had
done: fully explaining also why I had thus acted. Diana and Mary
approved the step unreservedly. Diana announced that she would just
give me time to get over the honeymoon, and then she would come and see
me.

“She had better not wait till then, Jane,” said Mr. Rochester, when I
read her letter to him; “if she does, she will be too late, for our
honeymoon will shine our life long: its beams will only fade over your
grave or mine.”

How St. John received the news, I don’t know: he never answered the
letter in which I communicated it: yet six months after he wrote to me,
without, however, mentioning Mr. Rochester’s name or alluding to my
marriage. His letter was then calm, and, though very serious, kind. He
has maintained a regular, though not frequent, correspondence ever
since: he hopes I am happy, and trusts I am not of those who live
without God in the world, and only mind earthly things.

You have not quite forgotten little Adèle, have you, reader? I had not;
I soon asked and obtained leave of Mr. Rochester, to go and see her at
the school where he had placed her. Her frantic joy at beholding me
again moved me much. She looked pale and thin: she said she was not
happy. I found the rules of the establishment were too strict, its
course of study too severe for a child of her age: I took her home with
me. I meant to become her governess once more, but I soon found this
impracticable; my time and cares were now required by another—my
husband needed them all. So I sought out a school conducted on a more
indulgent system, and near enough to permit of my visiting her often,
and bringing her home sometimes. I took care she should never want for
anything that could contribute to her comfort: she soon settled in her
new abode, became very happy there, and made fair progress in her
studies. As she grew up, a sound English education corrected in a great
measure her French defects; and when she left school, I found in her a
pleasing and obliging companion: docile, good-tempered, and
well-principled. By her grateful attention to me and mine, she has long
since well repaid any little kindness I ever had it in my power to
offer her.

My tale draws to its close: one word respecting my experience of
married life, and one brief glance at the fortunes of those whose names
have most frequently recurred in this narrative, and I have done.

I have now been married ten years. I know what it is to live entirely
for and with what I love best on earth. I hold myself supremely
blest—blest beyond what language can express; because I am my husband’s
life as fully as he is mine. No woman was ever nearer to her mate than
I am: ever more absolutely bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh. I
know no weariness of my Edward’s society: he knows none of mine, any
more than we each do of the pulsation of the heart that beats in our
separate bosoms; consequently, we are ever together. To be together is
for us to be at once as free as in solitude, as gay as in company. We
talk, I believe, all day long: to talk to each other is but a more
animated and an audible thinking. All my confidence is bestowed on him,
all his confidence is devoted to me; we are precisely suited in
character—perfect concord is the result.

Mr. Rochester continued blind the first two years of our union; perhaps
it was that circumstance that drew us so very near—that knit us so very
close: for I was then his vision, as I am still his right hand.
Literally, I was (what he often called me) the apple of his eye. He saw
nature—he saw books through me; and never did I weary of gazing for his
behalf, and of putting into words the effect of field, tree, town,
river, cloud, sunbeam—of the landscape before us; of the weather round
us—and impressing by sound on his ear what light could no longer stamp
on his eye. Never did I weary of reading to him; never did I weary of
conducting him where he wished to go: of doing for him what he wished
to be done. And there was a pleasure in my services, most full, most
exquisite, even though sad—because he claimed these services without
painful shame or damping humiliation. He loved me so truly, that he
knew no reluctance in profiting by my attendance: he felt I loved him
so fondly, that to yield that attendance was to indulge my sweetest
wishes.

One morning at the end of the two years, as I was writing a letter to
his dictation, he came and bent over me, and said—“Jane, have you a
glittering ornament round your neck?”

I had a gold watch-chain: I answered “Yes.”

“And have you a pale blue dress on?”


And have you a pale blue dress on?

I had. He informed me then, that for some time he had fancied the
obscurity clouding one eye was becoming less dense; and that now he was
sure of it.

He and I went up to London. He had the advice of an eminent oculist;
and he eventually recovered the sight of that one eye. He cannot now
see very distinctly: he cannot read or write much; but he can find his
way without being led by the hand: the sky is no longer a blank to
him—the earth no longer a void. When his first-born was put into his
arms, he could see that the boy had inherited his own eyes, as they
once were—large, brilliant, and black. On that occasion, he again, with
a full heart, acknowledged that God had tempered judgment with mercy.

My Edward and I, then, are happy: and the more so, because those we
most love are happy likewise. Diana and Mary Rivers are both married:
alternately, once every year, they come to see us, and we go to see
them. Diana’s husband is a captain in the navy, a gallant officer and a
good man. Mary’s is a clergyman, a college friend of her brother’s,
and, from his attainments and principles, worthy of the connection.
Both Captain Fitzjames and Mr. Wharton love their wives, and are loved
by them.

As to St. John Rivers, he left England: he went to India. He entered on
the path he had marked for himself; he pursues it still. A more
resolute, indefatigable pioneer never wrought amidst rocks and dangers.
Firm, faithful, and devoted, full of energy, and zeal, and truth, he
labours for his race; he clears their painful way to improvement; he
hews down like a giant the prejudices of creed and caste that encumber
it. He may be stern; he may be exacting; he may be ambitious yet; but
his is the sternness of the warrior Greatheart, who guards his pilgrim
convoy from the onslaught of Apollyon. His is the exaction of the
apostle, who speaks but for Christ, when he says—“Whosoever will come
after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross and follow me.”
His is the ambition of the high master-spirit, which aims to fill a
place in the first rank of those who are redeemed from the earth—who
stand without fault before the throne of God, who share the last mighty
victories of the Lamb, who are called, and chosen, and faithful.

St. John is unmarried: he never will marry now. Himself has hitherto
sufficed to the toil, and the toil draws near its close: his glorious
sun hastens to its setting. The last letter I received from him drew
from my eyes human tears, and yet filled my heart with divine joy: he
anticipated his sure reward, his incorruptible crown. I know that a
stranger’s hand will write to me next, to say that the good and
faithful servant has been called at length into the joy of his Lord.
And why weep for this? No fear of death will darken St. John’s last
hour: his mind will be unclouded, his heart will be undaunted, his hope
will be sure, his faith steadfast. His own words are a pledge of this—

“My Master,” he says, “has forewarned me. Daily He announces more
distinctly,—‘Surely I come quickly!’ and hourly I more eagerly
respond,—‘Amen; even so come, Lord Jesus!’”

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

PREFACE


After retiring from active business my husband yielded to the earnest
solicitations of friends, both here and in Great Britain, and began to
jot down from time to time recollections of his early days. He soon
found, however, that instead of the leisure he expected, his life was
more occupied with affairs than ever before, and the writing of these
memoirs was reserved for his play-time in Scotland. For a few weeks
each summer we retired to our little bungalow on the moors at
Aultnagar to enjoy the simple life, and it was there that Mr. Carnegie
did most of his writing. He delighted in going back to those early
times, and as he wrote he lived them all over again. He was thus
engaged in July, 1914, when the war clouds began to gather, and when
the fateful news of the 4th of August reached us, we immediately left
our retreat in the hills and returned to Skibo to be more in touch
with the situation.

These memoirs ended at that time. Henceforth he was never able to
interest himself in private affairs. Many times he made the attempt to
continue writing, but found it useless. Until then he had lived the
life of a man in middle life--and a young one at that--golfing,
fishing, swimming each day, sometimes doing all three in one day.
Optimist as he always was and tried to be, even in the face of the
failure of his hopes, the world disaster was too much. His heart was
broken. A severe attack of influenza followed by two serious attacks
of pneumonia precipitated old age upon him.

It was said of a contemporary who passed away a few months before Mr.
Carnegie that "he never could have borne the burden of old age."
Perhaps the most inspiring part of Mr. Carnegie's life, to those who
were privileged to know it intimately, was the way he bore his "burden
of old age." Always patient, considerate, cheerful, grateful for any
little pleasure or service, never thinking of himself, but always of
the dawning of the better day, his spirit ever shone brighter and
brighter until "he was not, for God took him."

Written with his own hand on the fly-leaf of his manuscript are these
words: "It is probable that material for a small volume might be
collected from these memoirs which the public would care to read, and
that a private and larger volume might please my relatives and
friends. Much I have written from time to time may, I think, wisely be
omitted. Whoever arranges these notes should be careful not to burden
the public with too much. A man with a heart as well as a head should
be chosen."

Who, then, could so well fill this description as our friend Professor
John C. Van Dyke? When the manuscript was shown to him, he remarked,
without having read Mr. Carnegie's notation, "It would be a labor of
love to prepare this for publication." Here, then, the choice was
mutual, and the manner in which he has performed this "labor" proves
the wisdom of the choice--a choice made and carried out in the name of
a rare and beautiful friendship.

EDITOR'S NOTE


The story of a man's life, especially when it is told by the man
himself, should not be interrupted by the hecklings of an editor. He
should be allowed to tell the tale in his own way, and enthusiasm,
even extravagance in recitation should be received as a part of the
story. The quality of the man may underlie exuberance of spirit, as
truth may be found in apparent exaggeration. Therefore, in preparing
these chapters for publication the editor has done little more than
arrange the material chronologically and sequentially so that the
narrative might run on unbrokenly to the end. Some footnotes by way of
explanation, some illustrations that offer sight-help to the text,
have been added; but the narrative is the thing.

This is neither the time nor the place to characterize or eulogize the
maker of "this strange eventful history," but perhaps it is worth
while to recognize that the history really was eventful. And strange.
Nothing stranger ever came out of the _Arabian Nights_ than the story
of this poor Scotch boy who came to America and step by step, through
many trials and triumphs, became the great steel master, built up a
colossal industry, amassed an enormous fortune, and then deliberately
and systematically gave away the whole of it for the enlightenment and
betterment of mankind. Not only that. He established a gospel of
wealth that can be neither ignored nor forgotten, and set a pace in
distribution that succeeding millionaires have followed as a
precedent. In the course of his career he became a nation-builder, a
leader in thought, a writer, a speaker, the friend of workmen,
schoolmen, and statesmen, the associate of both the lowly and the
lofty. But these were merely interesting happenings in his life as
compared with his great inspirations--his distribution of wealth, his
passion for world peace, and his love for mankind.

Perhaps we are too near this history to see it in proper proportions,
but in the time to come it should gain in perspective and in interest.
The generations hereafter may realize the wonder of it more fully than
we of to-day. Happily it is preserved to us, and that, too, in Mr.
Carnegie's own words and in his own buoyant style. It is a very
memorable record--a record perhaps the like of which we shall not look
upon again.

AUTOBIOGRAPHY

OF

ANDREW CARNEGIE




CHAPTER I

PARENTS AND CHILDHOOD


If the story of any man's life, truly told, must be interesting, as
some sage avers, those of my relatives and immediate friends who have
insisted upon having an account of mine may not be unduly disappointed
with this result. I may console myself with the assurance that such a
story must interest at least a certain number of people who have known
me, and that knowledge will encourage me to proceed.

A book of this kind, written years ago by my friend, Judge Mellon, of
Pittsburgh, gave me so much pleasure that I am inclined to agree with
the wise one whose opinion I have given above; for, certainly, the
story which the Judge told has proved a source of infinite
satisfaction to his friends, and must continue to influence succeeding
generations of his family to live life well. And not only this; to
some beyond his immediate circle it holds rank with their favorite
authors. The book contains one essential feature of value--it reveals
the man. It was written without any intention of attracting public
notice, being designed only for his family. In like manner I intend to
tell my story, not as one posturing before the public, but as in the
midst of my own people and friends, tried and true, to whom I can
speak with the utmost freedom, feeling that even trifling incidents
may not be wholly destitute of interest for them.

To begin, then, I was born in Dunfermline, in the attic of the small
one-story house, corner of Moodie Street and Priory Lane, on the 25th
of November, 1835, and, as the saying is, "of poor but honest parents,
of good kith and kin." Dunfermline had long been noted as the center
of the damask trade in Scotland.[1] My father, William Carnegie, was a
damask weaver, the son of Andrew Carnegie after whom I was named.

[Footnote 1: The Eighteenth-Century Carnegies lived at the picturesque
hamlet of Patiemuir, two miles south of Dunfermline. The growing
importance of the linen industry in Dunfermline finally led the
Carnegies to move to that town.]

My Grandfather Carnegie was well known throughout the district for his
wit and humor, his genial nature and irrepressible spirits. He was
head of the lively ones of his day, and known far and near as the
chief of their joyous club--"Patiemuir College." Upon my return to
Dunfermline, after an absence of fourteen years, I remember being
approached by an old man who had been told that I was the grandson of
the "Professor," my grandfather's title among his cronies. He was the
very picture of palsied eld;

    "His nose and chin they threatened ither."

As he tottered across the room toward me and laid his trembling hand
upon my head he said: "And ye are the grandson o' Andra Carnegie! Eh,
mon, I ha'e seen the day when your grandfaither and I could ha'e
hallooed ony reasonable man oot o' his jidgment."

[Illustration: ANDREW CARNEGIE'S BIRTHPLACE]

Several other old people of Dunfermline told me stories of my
grandfather. Here is one of them:

One Hogmanay night[2] an old wifey, quite a character in the
village, being surprised by a disguised face suddenly thrust in at the
window, looked up and after a moment's pause exclaimed, "Oh, it's jist
that daft callant Andra Carnegie." She was right; my grandfather at
seventy-five was out frightening his old lady friends, disguised like
other frolicking youngsters.

[Footnote 2: The 31st of December.]

I think my optimistic nature, my ability to shed trouble and to laugh
through life, making "all my ducks swans," as friends say I do, must
have been inherited from this delightful old masquerading grandfather
whose name I am proud to bear.[3] A sunny disposition is worth more
than fortune. Young people should know that it can be cultivated; that
the mind like the body can be moved from the shade into sunshine. Let
us move it then. Laugh trouble away if possible, and one usually can
if he be anything of a philosopher, provided that self-reproach comes
not from his own wrongdoing. That always remains. There is no washing
out of these "damned spots." The judge within sits in the supreme
court and can never be cheated. Hence the grand rule of life which
Burns gives:

    "Thine own reproach alone do fear."

[Footnote 3: "There is no sign that Andrew, though he prospered in his
wooing, was specially successful in acquisition of worldly gear.
Otherwise, however, he became an outstanding character not only in the
village, but in the adjoining city and district. A 'brainy' man who
read and thought for himself he became associated with the radical
weavers of Dunfermline, who in Patiemuir formed a meeting-place which
they named a college (Andrew was the 'Professor' of it)." (_Andrew
Carnegie: His Dunfermline Ties and Benefactions_, by J.B. Mackie,
F.J.I.)]

This motto adopted early in life has been more to me than all the
sermons I ever heard, and I have heard not a few, although I may admit
resemblance to my old friend Baillie Walker in my mature years. He was
asked by his doctor about his sleep and replied that it was far from
satisfactory, he was very wakeful, adding with a twinkle in his eye:
"But I get a bit fine doze i' the kirk noo and then."

On my mother's side the grandfather was even more marked, for my
grandfather Thomas Morrison was a friend of William Cobbett, a
contributor to his "Register," and in constant correspondence with
him. Even as I write, in Dunfermline old men who knew Grandfather
Morrison speak of him as one of the finest orators and ablest men they
have known. He was publisher of "The Precursor," a small edition it
might be said of Cobbett's "Register," and thought to have been the
first radical paper in Scotland. I have read some of his writings, and
in view of the importance now given to technical education, I think
the most remarkable of them is a pamphlet which he published
seventy-odd years ago entitled "Head-ication versus Hand-ication." It
insists upon the importance of the latter in a manner that would
reflect credit upon the strongest advocate of technical education
to-day. It ends with these words, "I thank God that in my youth I
learned to make and mend shoes." Cobbett published it in the
"Register" in 1833, remarking editorially, "One of the most valuable
communications ever published in the 'Register' upon the subject, is
that of our esteemed friend and correspondent in Scotland, Thomas
Morrison, which appears in this issue." So it seems I come by my
scribbling propensities by inheritance--from both sides, for the
Carnegies were also readers and thinkers.

My Grandfather Morrison was a born orator, a keen politician, and the
head of the advanced wing of the radical party in the district--a
position which his son, my Uncle Bailie Morrison, occupied as his
successor. More than one well-known Scotsman in America has called
upon me, to shake hands with "the grandson of Thomas Morrison." Mr.
Farmer, president of the Cleveland and Pittsburgh Railroad Company,
once said to me, "I owe all that I have of learning and culture to the
influence of your grandfather"; and Ebenezer Henderson, author of the
remarkable history of Dunfermline, stated that he largely owed his
advancement in life to the fortunate fact that while a boy he entered
my grandfather's service.

I have not passed so far through life without receiving some
compliments, but I think nothing of a complimentary character has ever
pleased me so much as this from a writer in a Glasgow newspaper, who
had been a listener to a speech on Home Rule in America which I
delivered in Saint Andrew's Hall. The correspondent wrote that much
was then being said in Scotland with regard to myself and family and
especially my grandfather Thomas Morrison, and he went on to say,
"Judge my surprise when I found in the grandson on the platform, in
manner, gesture and appearance, a perfect _facsimile_ of the Thomas
Morrison of old."

My surprising likeness to my grandfather, whom I do not remember to
have ever seen, cannot be doubted, because I remember well upon my
first return to Dunfermline in my twenty-seventh year, while sitting
upon a sofa with my Uncle Bailie Morrison, that his big black eyes
filled with tears. He could not speak and rushed out of the room
overcome. Returning after a time he explained that something in me now
and then flashed before him his father, who would instantly vanish but
come back at intervals. Some gesture it was, but what precisely he
could not make out. My mother continually noticed in me some of my
grandfather's peculiarities. The doctrine of inherited tendencies is
proved every day and hour, but how subtle is the law which transmits
gesture, something as it were beyond the material body. I was deeply
impressed.

My Grandfather Morrison married Miss Hodge, of Edinburgh, a lady in
education, manners, and position, who died while the family was still
young. At this time he was in good circumstances, a leather merchant
conducting the tanning business in Dunfermline; but the peace after
the Battle of Waterloo involved him in ruin, as it did thousands; so
that while my Uncle Bailie, the eldest son, had been brought up in
what might be termed luxury, for he had a pony to ride, the younger
members of the family encountered other and harder days.

The second daughter, Margaret, was my mother, about whom I cannot
trust myself to speak at length. She inherited from her mother the
dignity, refinement, and air of the cultivated lady. Perhaps some day
I may be able to tell the world something of this heroine, but I doubt
it. I feel her to be sacred to myself and not for others to know. None
could ever really know her--I alone did that. After my father's early
death she was all my own. The dedication of my first book[4] tells the
story. It was: "To my favorite Heroine My Mother."

[Footnote 4: _An American Four-in-Hand in Great Britain._ New York,
1888.]

[Illustration: DUNFERMLINE ABBEY]

Fortunate in my ancestors I was supremely so in my birthplace. Where
one is born is very important, for different surroundings and
traditions appeal to and stimulate different latent tendencies in the
child. Ruskin truly observes that every bright boy in Edinburgh is
influenced by the sight of the Castle. So is the child of Dunfermline,
by its noble Abbey, the Westminster of Scotland, founded early in the
eleventh century (1070) by Malcolm Canmore and his Queen Margaret,
Scotland's patron saint. The ruins of the great monastery and of
the Palace where kings were born still stand, and there, too, is
Pittencrieff Glen, embracing Queen Margaret's shrine and the ruins of
King Malcolm's Tower, with which the old ballad of "Sir Patrick Spens"
begins:

    "The King sits in Dunfermline _tower_,[5]
    Drinking the bluid red wine."

[Footnote 5: _The Percy Reliques_ and _The Oxford Book of Ballads_
give "town" instead of "tower"; but Mr. Carnegie insisted that it
should be "tower."]

The tomb of The Bruce is in the center of the Abbey, Saint Margaret's
tomb is near, and many of the "royal folk" lie sleeping close around.
Fortunate, indeed, the child who first sees the light in that romantic
town, which occupies high ground three miles north of the Firth of
Forth, overlooking the sea, with Edinburgh in sight to the south, and
to the north the peaks of the Ochils clearly in view. All is still
redolent of the mighty past when Dunfermline was both nationally and
religiously the capital of Scotland.

The child privileged to develop amid such surroundings absorbs poetry
and romance with the air he breathes, assimilates history and
tradition as he gazes around. These become to him his real world in
childhood--the ideal is the ever-present real. The actual has yet to
come when, later in life, he is launched into the workaday world of
stern reality. Even then, and till his last day, the early impressions
remain, sometimes for short seasons disappearing perchance, but only
apparently driven away or suppressed. They are always rising and
coming again to the front to exert their influence, to elevate his
thought and color his life. No bright child of Dunfermline can escape
the influence of the Abbey, Palace, and Glen. These touch him and set
fire to the latent spark within, making him something different and
beyond what, less happily born, he would have become. Under these
inspiring conditions my parents had also been born, and hence came, I
doubt not, the potency of the romantic and poetic strain which
pervaded both.

As my father succeeded in the weaving business we removed from Moodie
Street to a much more commodious house in Reid's Park. My father's
four or five looms occupied the lower story; we resided in the upper,
which was reached, after a fashion common in the older Scottish
houses, by outside stairs from the pavement. It is here that my
earliest recollections begin, and, strangely enough, the first trace
of memory takes me back to a day when I saw a small map of America. It
was upon rollers and about two feet square. Upon this my father,
mother, Uncle William, and Aunt Aitken were looking for Pittsburgh and
pointing out Lake Erie and Niagara. Soon after my uncle and Aunt
Aitken sailed for the land of promise.

At this time I remember my cousin-brother, George Lauder ("Dod"), and
myself were deeply impressed with the great danger overhanging us
because a lawless flag was secreted in the garret. It had been painted
to be carried, and I believe was carried by my father, or uncle, or
some other good radical of our family, in a procession during the Corn
Law agitation. There had been riots in the town and a troop of cavalry
was quartered in the Guildhall. My grandfathers and uncles on both
sides, and my father, had been foremost in addressing meetings, and
the whole family circle was in a ferment.

I remember as if it were yesterday being awakened during the night by
a tap at the back window by men who had come to inform my parents that
my uncle, Bailie Morrison, had been thrown into jail because he had
dared to hold a meeting which had been forbidden. The sheriff with the
aid of the soldiers had arrested him a few miles from the town where
the meeting had been held, and brought him into the town during the
night, followed by an immense throng of people.[6]

[Footnote 6: At the opening of the Lauder Technical School in October,
1880, nearly half a century after the disquieting scenes of 1842, Mr.
Carnegie thus recalled the shock which was given to his boy mind: "One
of my earliest recollections is that of being wakened in the darkness
to be told that my Uncle Morrison was in jail. Well, it is one of the
proudest boasts I can make to-day to be able to say that I had an
uncle who was in jail. But, ladies and gentlemen, my uncle went to
jail to vindicate the rights of public assembly." (Mackie.)]

Serious trouble was feared, for the populace threatened to rescue him,
and, as we learned afterwards, he had been induced by the provost of
the town to step forward to a window overlooking the High Street and
beg the people to retire. This he did, saying: "If there be a friend
of the good cause here to-night, let him fold his arms." They did so.
And then, after a pause, he said, "Now depart in peace!"[7] My uncle,
like all our family, was a moral-force man and strong for obedience to
law, but radical to the core and an intense admirer of the American
Republic.

[Footnote 7: "The Crown agents wisely let the proceedings lapse....
Mr. Morrison was given a gratifying assurance of the appreciation of
his fellow citizens by his election to the Council and his elevation
to the Magisterial Bench, followed shortly after by his appointment to
the office of Burgh Chamberlain. The patriotic reformer whom the
criminal authorities endeavored to convict as a law-breaker became by
the choice of his fellow citizens a Magistrate, and was further given
a certificate for trustworthiness and integrity." (Mackie.)]

One may imagine when all this was going on in public how bitter were
the words that passed from one to the other in private. The
denunciations of monarchical and aristocratic government, of privilege
in all its forms, the grandeur of the republican system, the
superiority of America, a land peopled by our own race, a home for
freemen in which every citizen's privilege was every man's
right--these were the exciting themes upon which I was nurtured. As a
child I could have slain king, duke, or lord, and considered their
deaths a service to the state and hence an heroic act.

Such is the influence of childhood's earliest associations that it was
long before I could trust myself to speak respectfully of any
privileged class or person who had not distinguished himself in some
good way and therefore earned the right to public respect. There was
still the sneer behind for mere pedigree--"he is nothing, has done
nothing, only an accident, a fraud strutting in borrowed plumes; all
he has to his account is the accident of birth; the most fruitful part
of his family, as with the potato, lies underground." I wondered that
intelligent men could live where another human being was born to a
privilege which was not also their birthright. I was never tired of
quoting the only words which gave proper vent to my indignation:

    "There was a Brutus once that would have brooked
    Th' eternal devil to keep his state in Rome
    As easily as a king."

But then kings were kings, not mere shadows. All this was inherited,
of course. I only echoed what I heard at home.

Dunfermline has long been renowned as perhaps the most radical town in
the Kingdom, although I know Paisley has claims. This is all the more
creditable to the cause of radicalism because in the days of which I
speak the population of Dunfermline was in large part composed of men
who were small manufacturers, each owning his own loom or looms. They
were not tied down to regular hours, their labors being piece work.
They got webs from the larger manufacturers and the weaving was done
at home.

These were times of intense political excitement, and there was
frequently seen throughout the entire town, for a short time after the
midday meal, small groups of men with their aprons girt about them
discussing affairs of state. The names of Hume, Cobden, and Bright
were upon every one's tongue. I was often attracted, small as I was,
to these circles and was an earnest listener to the conversation,
which was wholly one-sided. The generally accepted conclusion was that
there must be a change. Clubs were formed among the townsfolk, and the
London newspapers were subscribed for. The leading editorials were
read every evening to the people, strangely enough, from one of the
pulpits of the town. My uncle, Bailie Morrison, was often the reader,
and, as the articles were commented upon by him and others after being
read, the meetings were quite exciting.

These political meetings were of frequent occurrence, and, as might be
expected, I was as deeply interested as any of the family and attended
many. One of my uncles or my father was generally to be heard. I
remember one evening my father addressed a large outdoor meeting in
the Pends. I had wedged my way in under the legs of the hearers, and
at one cheer louder than all the rest I could not restrain my
enthusiasm. Looking up to the man under whose legs I had found
protection I informed him that was my father speaking. He lifted me on
his shoulder and kept me there.

To another meeting I was taken by my father to hear John Bright, who
spoke in favor of J.B. Smith as the Liberal candidate for the Stirling
Burghs. I made the criticism at home that Mr. Bright did not speak
correctly, as he said "men" when he meant "maan." He did not give the
broad _a_ we were accustomed to in Scotland. It is not to be wondered
at that, nursed amid such surroundings, I developed into a violent
young Republican whose motto was "death to privilege." At that time I
did not know what privilege meant, but my father did.

One of my Uncle Lauder's best stories was about this same J.B. Smith,
the friend of John Bright, who was standing for Parliament in
Dunfermline. Uncle was a member of his Committee and all went well
until it was proclaimed that Smith was a "Unitawrian." The district
was placarded with the enquiry: Would you vote for a "Unitawrian"? It
was serious. The Chairman of Smith's Committee in the village of
Cairney Hill, a blacksmith, was reported as having declared he never
would. Uncle drove over to remonstrate with him. They met in the
village tavern over a gill:

"Man, I canna vote for a Unitawrian," said the Chairman.

"But," said my uncle, "Maitland [the opposing candidate] is a
Trinitawrian."

"Damn; that's waur," was the response.

And the blacksmith voted right. Smith won by a small majority.

The change from hand-loom to steam-loom weaving was disastrous to our
family. My father did not recognize the impending revolution, and was
struggling under the old system. His looms sank greatly in value, and
it became necessary for that power which never failed in any
emergency--my mother--to step forward and endeavor to repair the
family fortune. She opened a small shop in Moodie Street and
contributed to the revenues which, though slender, nevertheless at
that time sufficed to keep us in comfort and "respectable."

I remember that shortly after this I began to learn what poverty
meant. Dreadful days came when my father took the last of his webs to
the great manufacturer, and I saw my mother anxiously awaiting his
return to know whether a new web was to be obtained or that a period
of idleness was upon us. It was burnt into my heart then that my
father, though neither "abject, mean, nor vile," as Burns has it, had
nevertheless to

    "Beg a brother of the earth
    To give him leave to toil."

And then and there came the resolve that I would cure that when I got
to be a man. We were not, however, reduced to anything like poverty
compared with many of our neighbors. I do not know to what lengths of
privation my mother would not have gone that she might see her two
boys wearing large white collars, and trimly dressed.

In an incautious moment my parents had promised that I should never be
sent to school until I asked leave to go. This promise I afterward
learned began to give them considerable uneasiness because as I grew
up I showed no disposition to ask. The schoolmaster, Mr. Robert
Martin, was applied to and induced to take some notice of me. He took
me upon an excursion one day with some of my companions who attended
school, and great relief was experienced by my parents when one day
soon afterward I came and asked for permission to go to Mr. Martin's
school.[8] I need not say the permission was duly granted. I had then
entered upon my eighth year, which subsequent experience leads me to
say is quite early enough for any child to begin attending school.

[Footnote 8: It was known as Rolland School.]

The school was a perfect delight to me, and if anything occurred which
prevented my attendance I was unhappy. This happened every now and
then because my morning duty was to bring water from the well at the
head of Moodie Street. The supply was scanty and irregular. Sometimes
it was not allowed to run until late in the morning and a score of old
wives were sitting around, the turn of each having been previously
secured through the night by placing a worthless can in the line.
This, as might be expected, led to numerous contentions in which I
would not be put down even by these venerable old dames. I earned the
reputation of being "an awfu' laddie." In this way I probably
developed the strain of argumentativeness, or perhaps combativeness,
which has always remained with me.

In the performance of these duties I was often late for school, but
the master, knowing the cause, forgave the lapses. In the same
connection I may mention that I had often the shop errands to run
after school, so that in looking back upon my life I have the
satisfaction of feeling that I became useful to my parents even at the
early age of ten. Soon after that the accounts of the various people
who dealt with the shop were entrusted to my keeping so that I became
acquainted, in a small way, with business affairs even in childhood.

One cause of misery there was, however, in my school experience. The
boys nicknamed me "Martin's pet," and sometimes called out that
dreadful epithet to me as I passed along the street. I did not know
all that it meant, but it seemed to me a term of the utmost
opprobrium, and I know that it kept me from responding as freely as I
should otherwise have done to that excellent teacher, my only
schoolmaster, to whom I owe a debt of gratitude which I regret I never
had opportunity to do more than acknowledge before he died.

I may mention here a man whose influence over me cannot be
overestimated, my Uncle Lauder, George Lauder's father.[9] My father
was necessarily constantly at work in the loom shop and had little
leisure to bestow upon me through the day. My uncle being a shopkeeper
in the High Street was not thus tied down. Note the location, for this
was among the shopkeeping aristocracy, and high and varied degrees of
aristocracy there were even among shopkeepers in Dunfermline. Deeply
affected by my Aunt Seaton's death, which occurred about the beginning
of my school life, he found his chief solace in the companionship of
his only son, George, and myself. He possessed an extraordinary gift
of dealing with children and taught us many things. Among others I
remember how he taught us British history by imagining each of the
monarchs in a certain place upon the walls of the room performing the
act for which he was well known. Thus for me King John sits to this
day above the mantelpiece signing the Magna Charta, and Queen Victoria
is on the back of the door with her children on her knee.

[Footnote 9: The Lauder Technical College given by Mr. Carnegie to
Dunfermline was named in honor of this uncle, George Lauder.]

It may be taken for granted that the omission which, years after, I
found in the Chapter House at Westminster Abbey was fully supplied in
our list of monarchs. A slab in a small chapel at Westminster says
that the body of Oliver Cromwell was removed from there. In the list
of the monarchs which I learned at my uncle's knee the grand
republican monarch appeared writing his message to the Pope of Rome,
informing His Holiness that "if he did not cease persecuting the
Protestants the thunder of Great Britain's cannon would be heard in
the Vatican." It is needless to say that the estimate we formed of
Cromwell was that he was worth them "a' thegither."

It was from my uncle I learned all that I know of the early history of
Scotland--of Wallace and Bruce and Burns, of Blind Harry's history, of
Scott, Ramsey, Tannahill, Hogg, and Fergusson. I can truly say in the
words of Burns that there was then and there created in me a vein of
Scottish prejudice (or patriotism) which will cease to exist only with
life. Wallace, of course, was our hero. Everything heroic centered in
him. Sad was the day when a wicked big boy at school told me that
England was far larger than Scotland. I went to the uncle, who had the
remedy.

"Not at all, Naig; if Scotland were rolled out flat as England,
Scotland would be the larger, but would you have the Highlands rolled
down?"

Oh, never! There was balm in Gilead for the wounded young patriot.
Later the greater population of England was forced upon me, and again
to the uncle I went.

"Yes, Naig, seven to one, but there were more than that odds against
us at Bannockburn." And again there was joy in my heart--joy that
there were more English men there since the glory was the greater.

This is something of a commentary upon the truth that war breeds war,
that every battle sows the seeds of future battles, and that thus
nations become traditional enemies. The experience of American boys is
that of the Scotch. They grow up to read of Washington and Valley
Forge, of Hessians hired to kill Americans, and they come to hate the
very name of Englishman. Such was my experience with my American
nephews. Scotland was all right, but England that had fought Scotland
was the wicked partner. Not till they became men was the prejudice
eradicated, and even yet some of it may linger.

Uncle Lauder has told me since that he often brought people into the
room assuring them that he could make "Dod" (George Lauder) and me
weep, laugh, or close our little fists ready to fight--in short, play
upon all our moods through the influence of poetry and song. The
betrayal of Wallace was his trump card which never failed to cause our
little hearts to sob, a complete breakdown being the invariable
result. Often as he told the story it never lost its hold. No doubt it
received from time to time new embellishments. My uncle's stories
never wanted "the hat and the stick" which Scott gave his. How
wonderful is the influence of a hero upon children!

I spent many hours and evenings in the High Street with my uncle and
"Dod," and thus began a lifelong brotherly alliance between the latter
and myself. "Dod" and "Naig" we always were in the family. I could not
say "George" in infancy and he could not get more than "Naig" out of
Carnegie, and it has always been "Dod" and "Naig" with us. No other
names would mean anything.

There were two roads by which to return from my uncle's house in the
High Street to my home in Moodie Street at the foot of the town, one
along the eerie churchyard of the Abbey among the dead, where there
was no light; and the other along the lighted streets by way of the
May Gate. When it became necessary for me to go home, my uncle, with a
wicked pleasure, would ask which way I was going. Thinking what
Wallace would do, I always replied I was going by the Abbey. I have
the satisfaction of believing that never, not even upon one occasion,
did I yield to the temptation to take the other turn and follow the
lamps at the junction of the May Gate. I often passed along that
churchyard and through the dark arch of the Abbey with my heart in my
mouth. Trying to whistle and keep up my courage, I would plod through
the darkness, falling back in all emergencies upon the thought of what
Wallace would have done if he had met with any foe, natural or
supernatural.

King Robert the Bruce never got justice from my cousin or myself in
childhood. It was enough for us that he was a king while Wallace was
the man of the people. Sir John Graham was our second. The intensity
of a Scottish boy's patriotism, reared as I was, constitutes a real
force in his life to the very end. If the source of my stock of that
prime article--courage--were studied, I am sure the final analysis
would find it founded upon Wallace, the hero of Scotland. It is a
tower of strength for a boy to have a hero.

It gave me a pang to find when I reached America that there was any
other country which pretended to have anything to be proud of. What
was a country without Wallace, Bruce, and Burns? I find in the
untraveled Scotsman of to-day something still of this feeling. It
remains for maturer years and wider knowledge to tell us that every
nation has its heroes, its romance, its traditions, and its
achievements; and while the true Scotsman will not find reason in
after years to lower the estimate he has formed of his own country and
of its position even among the larger nations of the earth, he will
find ample reason to raise his opinion of other nations because they
all have much to be proud of--quite enough to stimulate their sons so
to act their parts as not to disgrace the land that gave them birth.

It was years before I could feel that the new land could be anything
but a temporary abode. My heart was in Scotland. I resembled Principal
Peterson's little boy who, when in Canada, in reply to a question,
said he liked Canada "very well for a visit, but he could never live
so far away from the remains of Bruce and Wallace."




CHAPTER II

DUNFERMLINE AND AMERICA


My good Uncle Lauder justly set great value upon recitation in
education, and many were the pennies which Dod and I received for
this. In our little frocks or shirts, our sleeves rolled up, paper
helmets and blackened faces, with laths for swords, my cousin and
myself were kept constantly reciting Norval and Glenalvon, Roderick
Dhu and James Fitz-James to our schoolmates and often to the older
people.

I remember distinctly that in the celebrated dialogue between Norval
and Glenalvon we had some qualms about repeating the phrase,--"and
false as _hell_." At first we made a slight cough over the
objectionable word which always created amusement among the
spectators. It was a great day for us when my uncle persuaded us that
we could say "hell" without swearing. I am afraid we practiced it very
often. I always played the part of Glenalvon and made a great mouthful
of the word. It had for me the wonderful fascination attributed to
forbidden fruit. I can well understand the story of Marjory Fleming,
who being cross one morning when Walter Scott called and asked how she
was, answered:

"I am very cross this morning, Mr. Scott. I just want to say 'damn'
[with a swing], but I winna."

Thereafter the expression of the one fearful word was a great point.
Ministers could say "damnation" in the pulpit without sin, and so we,
too, had full range on "hell" in recitation. Another passage made a
deep impression. In the fight between Norval and Glenalvon, Norval
says, "When we contend again our strife is mortal." Using these words
in an article written for the "North American Review" in 1897, my
uncle came across them and immediately sat down and wrote me from
Dunfermline that he knew where I had found the words. He was the only
man living who did.

My power to memorize must have been greatly strengthened by the mode
of teaching adopted by my uncle. I cannot name a more important means
of benefiting young people than encouraging them to commit favorite
pieces to memory and recite them often. Anything which pleased me I
could learn with a rapidity which surprised partial friends. I could
memorize anything whether it pleased me or not, but if it did not
impress me strongly it passed away in a few hours.

One of the trials of my boy's life at school in Dunfermline was
committing to memory two double verses of the Psalms which I had to
recite daily. My plan was not to look at the psalm until I had started
for school. It was not more than five or six minutes' slow walk, but I
could readily master the task in that time, and, as the psalm was the
first lesson, I was prepared and passed through the ordeal
successfully. Had I been asked to repeat the psalm thirty minutes
afterwards the attempt would, I fear, have ended in disastrous
failure.

The first penny I ever earned or ever received from any person beyond
the family circle was one from my school-teacher, Mr. Martin, for
repeating before the school Burns's poem, "Man was made to Mourn." In
writing this I am reminded that in later years, dining with Mr. John
Morley in London, the conversation turned upon the life of Wordsworth,
and Mr. Morley said he had been searching his Burns for the poem to
"Old Age," so much extolled by him, which he had not been able to find
under that title. I had the pleasure of repeating part of it to him.
He promptly handed me a second penny. Ah, great as Morley is, he
wasn't my school-teacher, Mr. Martin--the first "great" man I ever
knew. Truly great was he to me. But a hero surely is "Honest John"
Morley.

In religious matters we were not much hampered. While other boys and
girls at school were compelled to learn the Shorter Catechism, Dod and
I, by some arrangement the details of which I never clearly
understood, were absolved. All of our family connections, Morrisons
and Lauders, were advanced in their theological as in their political
views, and had objections to the catechism, I have no doubt. We had
not one orthodox Presbyterian in our family circle. My father, Uncle
and Aunt Aitken, Uncle Lauder, and also my Uncle Carnegie, had fallen
away from the tenets of Calvinism. At a later day most of them found
refuge for a time in the doctrines of Swedenborg. My mother was always
reticent upon religious subjects. She never mentioned these to me nor
did she attend church, for she had no servant in those early days and
did all the housework, including cooking our Sunday dinner. A great
reader, always, Channing the Unitarian was in those days her special
delight. She was a marvel!

[Illustration: ANDREW CARNEGIE'S MOTHER]

During my childhood the atmosphere around me was in a state of violent
disturbance in matters theological as well as political. Along with
the most advanced ideas which were being agitated in the political
world--the death of privilege, the equality of the citizen,
Republicanism--I heard many disputations upon theological subjects
which the impressionable child drank in to an extent quite unthought
of by his elders. I well remember that the stern doctrines of
Calvinism lay as a terrible nightmare upon me, but that state of mind
was soon over, owing to the influences of which I have spoken. I
grew up treasuring within me the fact that my father had risen and
left the Presbyterian Church one day when the minister preached the
doctrine of infant damnation. This was shortly after I had made my
appearance.

Father could not stand it and said: "If that be your religion and that
your God, I seek a better religion and a nobler God." He left the
Presbyterian Church never to return, but he did not cease to attend
various other churches. I saw him enter the closet every morning to
pray and that impressed me. He was indeed a saint and always remained
devout. All sects became to him as agencies for good. He had
discovered that theologies were many, but religion was one. I was
quite satisfied that my father knew better than the minister, who
pictured not the Heavenly Father, but the cruel avenger of the Old
Testament--an "Eternal Torturer" as Andrew D. White ventures to call
him in his autobiography. Fortunately this conception of the Unknown
is now largely of the past.

One of the chief enjoyments of my childhood was the keeping of pigeons
and rabbits. I am grateful every time I think of the trouble my father
took to build a suitable house for these pets. Our home became
headquarters for my young companions. My mother was always looking to
home influences as the best means of keeping her two boys in the right
path. She used to say that the first step in this direction was to
make home pleasant; and there was nothing she and my father would not
do to please us and the neighbors' children who centered about us.

My first business venture was securing my companions' services for a
season as an employer, the compensation being that the young rabbits,
when such came, should be named after them. The Saturday holiday was
generally spent by my flock in gathering food for the rabbits. My
conscience reproves me to-day, looking back, when I think of the hard
bargain I drove with my young playmates, many of whom were content to
gather dandelions and clover for a whole season with me, conditioned
upon this unique reward--the poorest return ever made to labor. Alas!
what else had I to offer them! Not a penny.

I treasure the remembrance of this plan as the earliest evidence of
organizing power upon the development of which my material success in
life has hung--a success not to be attributed to what I have known or
done myself, but to the faculty of knowing and choosing others who did
know better than myself. Precious knowledge this for any man to
possess. I did not understand steam machinery, but I tried to
understand that much more complicated piece of mechanism--man.
Stopping at a small Highland inn on our coaching trip in 1898, a
gentleman came forward and introduced himself. He was Mr. MacIntosh,
the great furniture manufacturer of Scotland--a fine character as I
found out afterward. He said he had ventured to make himself known as
he was one of the boys who had gathered, and sometimes he feared
"conveyed," spoil for the rabbits, and had "one named after him." It
may be imagined how glad I was to meet him--the only one of the rabbit
boys I have met in after-life. I hope to keep his friendship to the
last and see him often. [As I read this manuscript to-day, December 1,
1913, I have a very precious note from him, recalling old times when
we were boys together. He has a reply by this time that will warm his
heart as his note did mine.]

With the introduction and improvement of steam machinery, trade grew
worse and worse in Dunfermline for the small manufacturers, and at
last a letter was written to my mother's two sisters in Pittsburgh
stating that the idea of our going to them was seriously
entertained--not, as I remember hearing my parents say, to benefit
their own condition, but for the sake of their two young sons.
Satisfactory letters were received in reply. The decision was taken to
sell the looms and furniture by auction. And my father's sweet voice
sang often to mother, brother, and me:

    "To the West, to the West, to the land of the free,
    Where the mighty Missouri rolls down to the sea;
    Where a man is a man even though he must toil
    And the poorest may gather the fruits of the soil."

The proceeds of the sale were most disappointing. The looms brought
hardly anything, and the result was that twenty pounds more were
needed to enable the family to pay passage to America. Here let me
record an act of friendship performed by a lifelong companion of my
mother--who always attracted stanch friends because she was so stanch
herself--Mrs. Henderson, by birth Ella Ferguson, the name by which she
was known in our family. She boldly ventured to advance the needful
twenty pounds, my Uncles Lauder and Morrison guaranteeing repayment.
Uncle Lauder also lent his aid and advice, managing all the details
for us, and on the 17th day of May, 1848, we left Dunfermline. My
father's age was then forty-three, my mother's thirty-three. I was in
my thirteenth year, my brother Tom in his fifth year--a beautiful
white-haired child with lustrous black eyes, who everywhere attracted
attention.

I had left school forever, with the exception of one winter's
night-schooling in America, and later a French night-teacher for a
time, and, strange to say, an elocutionist from whom I learned how to
declaim. I could read, write, and cipher, and had begun the study of
algebra and of Latin. A letter written to my Uncle Lauder during the
voyage, and since returned, shows that I was then a better penman than
now. I had wrestled with English grammar, and knew as little of what
it was designed to teach as children usually do. I had read little
except about Wallace, Bruce, and Burns; but knew many familiar pieces
of poetry by heart. I should add to this the fairy tales of childhood,
and especially the "Arabian Nights," by which I was carried into a new
world. I was in dreamland as I devoured those stories.

On the morning of the day we started from beloved Dunfermline, in the
omnibus that ran upon the coal railroad to Charleston, I remember that
I stood with tearful eyes looking out of the window until Dunfermline
vanished from view, the last structure to fade being the grand and
sacred old Abbey. During my first fourteen years of absence my thought
was almost daily, as it was that morning, "When shall I see you
again?" Few days passed in which I did not see in my mind's eye the
talismanic letters on the Abbey tower--"King Robert The Bruce." All my
recollections of childhood, all I knew of fairyland, clustered around
the old Abbey and its curfew bell, which tolled at eight o'clock every
evening and was the signal for me to run to bed before it stopped. I
have referred to that bell in my "American Four-in-Hand in
Britain"[10] when passing the Abbey and I may as well quote from it
now:

[Footnote 10: _An American Four-in-Hand in Britain_. New York, 1886.]

     As we drove down the Pends I was standing on the front seat
     of the coach with Provost Walls, when I heard the first toll
     of the Abbey bell, tolled in honor of my mother and myself.
     My knees sank from under me, the tears came rushing before I
     knew it, and I turned round to tell the Provost that I must
     give in. For a moment I felt as if I were about to faint.
     Fortunately I saw that there was no crowd before us for a
     little distance. I had time to regain control, and biting my
     lips till they actually bled, I murmured to myself, "No
     matter, keep cool, you must go on"; but never can there come
     to my ears on earth, nor enter so deep into my soul, a sound
     that shall haunt and subdue me with its sweet, gracious,
     melting power as that did.

     By that curfew bell I had been laid in my little couch to
     sleep the sleep of childish innocence. Father and mother,
     sometimes the one, sometimes the other, had told me as they
     bent lovingly over me night after night, what that bell said
     as it tolled. Many good words has that bell spoken to me
     through their translations. No wrong thing did I do through
     the day which that voice from all I knew of heaven and the
     great Father there did not tell me kindly about ere I sank
     to sleep, speaking the words so plainly that I knew that the
     power that moved it had seen all and was not angry, never
     angry, never, but so very, _very_ sorry. Nor is that bell
     dumb to me to-day when I hear its voice. It still has its
     message, and now it sounded to welcome back the exiled
     mother and son under its precious care again.

     The world has not within its power to devise, much less to
     bestow upon us, such reward as that which the Abbey bell
     gave when it tolled in our honor. But my brother Tom should
     have been there also; this was the thought that came. He,
     too, was beginning to know the wonders of that bell ere we
     were away to the newer land.

     Rousseau wished to die to the strains of sweet music. Could
     I choose my accompaniment, I could wish to pass into the dim
     beyond with the tolling of the Abbey bell sounding in my
     ears, telling me of the race that had been run, and calling
     me, as it had called the little white-haired child, for the
     last time--_to sleep_.

I have had many letters from readers speaking of this passage in my
book, some of the writers going so far as to say that tears fell as
they read. It came from the heart and perhaps that is why it reached
the hearts of others.

We were rowed over in a small boat to the Edinburgh steamer in the
Firth of Forth. As I was about to be taken from the small boat to the
steamer, I rushed to Uncle Lauder and clung round his neck, crying
out: "I cannot leave you! I cannot leave you!" I was torn from him by
a kind sailor who lifted me up on the deck of the steamer. Upon my
return visit to Dunfermline this dear old fellow, when he came to see
me, told me it was the saddest parting he had ever witnessed.

We sailed from the Broomielaw of Glasgow in the 800-ton sailing ship
Wiscasset. During the seven weeks of the voyage, I came to know the
sailors quite well, learned the names of the ropes, and was able to
direct the passengers to answer the call of the boatswain, for the
ship being undermanned, the aid of the passengers was urgently
required. In consequence I was invited by the sailors to participate
on Sundays, in the one delicacy of the sailors' mess, plum duff. I
left the ship with sincere regret.

The arrival at New York was bewildering. I had been taken to see the
Queen at Edinburgh, but that was the extent of my travels before
emigrating. Glasgow we had not time to see before we sailed. New York
was the first great hive of human industry among the inhabitants of
which I had mingled, and the bustle and excitement of it overwhelmed
me. The incident of our stay in New York which impressed me most
occurred while I was walking through Bowling Green at Castle Garden. I
was caught up in the arms of one of the Wiscasset sailors, Robert
Barryman, who was decked out in regular Jackashore fashion, with blue
jacket and white trousers. I thought him the most beautiful man I had
ever seen.

He took me to a refreshment stand and ordered a glass of sarsaparilla
for me, which I drank with as much relish as if it were the nectar of
the gods. To this day nothing that I have ever seen of the kind rivals
the image which remains in my mind of the gorgeousness of the highly
ornamented brass vessel out of which that nectar came foaming. Often
as I have passed the identical spot I see standing there the old
woman's sarsaparilla stand, and I marvel what became of the dear old
sailor. I have tried to trace him, but in vain, hoping that if found
he might be enjoying a ripe old age, and that it might be in my power
to add to the pleasure of his declining years. He was my ideal Tom
Bowling, and when that fine old song is sung I always see as the "form
of manly beauty" my dear old friend Barryman. Alas! ere this he's gone
aloft. Well; by his kindness on the voyage he made one boy his devoted
friend and admirer.

We knew only Mr. and Mrs. Sloane in New York--parents of the
well-known John, Willie, and Henry Sloane. Mrs. Sloane (Euphemia
Douglas) was my mother's companion in childhood in Dunfermline. Mr.
Sloane and my father had been fellow weavers. We called upon them and
were warmly welcomed. It was a genuine pleasure when Willie, his son,
bought ground from me in 1900 opposite our New York residence for his
two married daughters so that our children of the third generation
became playmates as our mothers were in Scotland.

My father was induced by emigration agents in New York to take the
Erie Canal by way of Buffalo and Lake Erie to Cleveland, and thence
down the canal to Beaver--a journey which then lasted three weeks,
and is made to-day by rail in ten hours. There was no railway
communication then with Pittsburgh, nor indeed with any western town.
The Erie Railway was under construction and we saw gangs of men at
work upon it as we traveled. Nothing comes amiss to youth, and I look
back upon my three weeks as a passenger upon the canal-boat with
unalloyed pleasure. All that was disagreeable in my experience has
long since faded from recollection, excepting the night we were
compelled to remain upon the wharf-boat at Beaver waiting for the
steamboat to take us up the Ohio to Pittsburgh. This was our first
introduction to the mosquito in all its ferocity. My mother suffered
so severely that in the morning she could hardly see. We were all
frightful sights, but I do not remember that even the stinging misery
of that night kept me from sleeping soundly. I could always sleep,
never knowing "horrid night, the child of hell."

Our friends in Pittsburgh had been anxiously waiting to hear from us,
and in their warm and affectionate greeting all our troubles were
forgotten. We took up our residence with them in Allegheny City. A
brother of my Uncle Hogan had built a small weaver's shop at the back
end of a lot in Rebecca Street. This had a second story in which there
were two rooms, and it was in these (free of rent, for my Aunt Aitken
owned them) that my parents began housekeeping. My uncle soon gave up
weaving and my father took his place and began making tablecloths,
which he had not only to weave, but afterwards, acting as his own
merchant, to travel and sell, as no dealers could be found to take
them in quantity. He was compelled to market them himself, selling
from door to door. The returns were meager in the extreme.

[Illustration: ANDREW CARNEGIE AT SIXTEEN WITH HIS BROTHER THOMAS]

As usual, my mother came to the rescue. There was no keeping her down.
In her youth she had learned to bind shoes in her father's business
for pin-money, and the skill then acquired was now turned to account
for the benefit of the family. Mr. Phipps, father of my friend and
partner Mr. Henry Phipps, was, like my grandfather, a master
shoemaker. He was our neighbor in Allegheny City. Work was obtained
from him, and in addition to attending to her household duties--for,
of course, we had no servant--this wonderful woman, my mother, earned
four dollars a week by binding shoes. Midnight would often find her at
work. In the intervals during the day and evening, when household
cares would permit, and my young brother sat at her knee threading
needles and waxing the thread for her, she recited to him, as she had
to me, the gems of Scottish minstrelsy which she seemed to have by
heart, or told him tales which failed not to contain a moral.

This is where the children of honest poverty have the most precious of
all advantages over those of wealth. The mother, nurse, cook,
governess, teacher, saint, all in one; the father, exemplar, guide,
counselor, and friend! Thus were my brother and I brought up. What has
the child of millionaire or nobleman that counts compared to such a
heritage?

My mother was a busy woman, but all her work did not prevent her
neighbors from soon recognizing her as a wise and kindly woman whom
they could call upon for counsel or help in times of trouble. Many
have told me what my mother did for them. So it was in after years
wherever we resided; rich and poor came to her with their trials and
found good counsel. She towered among her neighbors wherever she
went.




CHAPTER III

PITTSBURGH AND WORK


The great question now was, what could be found for me to do. I had
just completed my thirteenth year, and I fairly panted to get to work
that I might help the family to a start in the new land. The prospect
of want had become to me a frightful nightmare. My thoughts at this
period centered in the determination that we should make and save
enough of money to produce three hundred dollars a year--twenty-five
dollars monthly, which I figured was the sum required to keep us
without being dependent upon others. Every necessary thing was very
cheap in those days.

The brother of my Uncle Hogan would often ask what my parents meant to
do with me, and one day there occurred the most tragic of all scenes I
have ever witnessed. Never can I forget it. He said, with the kindest
intentions in the world, to my mother, that I was a likely boy and apt
to learn; and he believed that if a basket were fitted out for me with
knickknacks to sell, I could peddle them around the wharves and make
quite a considerable sum. I never knew what an enraged woman meant
till then. My mother was sitting sewing at the moment, but she sprang
to her feet with outstretched hands and shook them in his face.

"What! my son a peddler and go among rough men upon the wharves! I
would rather throw him into the Allegheny River. Leave me!" she cried,
pointing to the door, and Mr. Hogan went.

She stood a tragic queen. The next moment she had broken down, but
only for a few moments did tears fall and sobs come. Then she took her
two boys in her arms and told us not to mind her foolishness. There
were many things in the world for us to do and we could be useful men,
honored and respected, if we always did what was right. It was a
repetition of Helen Macgregor, in her reply to Osbaldistone in which
she threatened to have her prisoners "chopped into as many pieces as
there are checks in the tartan." But the reason for the outburst was
different. It was not because the occupation suggested was peaceful
labor, for we were taught that idleness was disgraceful; but because
the suggested occupation was somewhat vagrant in character and not
entirely respectable in her eyes. Better death. Yes, mother would have
taken her two boys, one under each arm, and perished with them rather
than they should mingle with low company in their extreme youth.

As I look back upon the early struggles this can be said: there was
not a prouder family in the land. A keen sense of honor, independence,
self-respect, pervaded the household. Walter Scott said of Burns that
he had the most extraordinary eye he ever saw in a human being. I can
say as much for my mother. As Burns has it:

    "Her eye even turned on empty space,
    Beamed keen with honor."

Anything low, mean, deceitful, shifty, coarse, underhand, or gossipy
was foreign to that heroic soul. Tom and I could not help growing up
respectable characters, having such a mother and such a father, for
the father, too, was one of nature's noblemen, beloved by all, a
saint.

Soon after this incident my father found it necessary to give up
hand-loom weaving and to enter the cotton factory of Mr. Blackstock,
an old Scotsman in Allegheny City, where we lived. In this factory he
also obtained for me a position as bobbin boy, and my first work was
done there at one dollar and twenty cents per week. It was a hard
life. In the winter father and I had to rise and breakfast in the
darkness, reach the factory before it was daylight, and, with a short
interval for lunch, work till after dark. The hours hung heavily upon
me and in the work itself I took no pleasure; but the cloud had a
silver lining, as it gave me the feeling that I was doing something
for my world--our family. I have made millions since, but none of
those millions gave me such happiness as my first week's earnings. I
was now a helper of the family, a breadwinner, and no longer a total
charge upon my parents. Often had I heard my father's beautiful
singing of "The Boatie Rows" and often I longed to fulfill the last
lines of the verse:

    "When Aaleck, Jock, and Jeanettie,
    _Are up and got their lair_,[11]
    They'll serve to gar the boatie row,
    And lichten a' our care."

[Footnote 11: Education.]

I was going to make our tiny craft skim. It should be noted here that
Aaleck, Jock, and Jeanettie were first to get their education.
Scotland was the first country that required all parents, high or low,
to educate their children, and established the parish public schools.

Soon after this Mr. John Hay, a fellow-Scotch manufacturer of bobbins
in Allegheny City, needed a boy, and asked whether I would not go into
his service. I went, and received two dollars per week; but at first
the work was even more irksome than the factory. I had to run a small
steam-engine and to fire the boiler in the cellar of the bobbin
factory. It was too much for me. I found myself night after night,
sitting up in bed trying the steam gauges, fearing at one time that
the steam was too low and that the workers above would complain that
they had not power enough, and at another time that the steam was too
high and that the boiler might burst.

But all this it was a matter of honor to conceal from my parents. They
had their own troubles and bore them. I must play the man and bear
mine. My hopes were high, and I looked every day for some change to
take place. What it was to be I knew not, but that it would come I
felt certain if I kept on. Besides, at this date I was not beyond
asking myself what Wallace would have done and what a Scotsman ought
to do. Of one thing I was sure, he ought never to give up.

One day the chance came. Mr. Hay had to make out some bills. He had no
clerk, and was himself a poor penman. He asked me what kind of hand I
could write, and gave me some writing to do. The result pleased him,
and he found it convenient thereafter to let me make out his bills. I
was also good at figures; and he soon found it to be to his
interest--and besides, dear old man, I believe he was moved by good
feeling toward the white-haired boy, for he had a kind heart and was
Scotch and wished to relieve me from the engine--to put me at other
things, less objectionable except in one feature.

It now became my duty to bathe the newly made spools in vats of oil.
Fortunately there was a room reserved for this purpose and I was
alone, but not all the resolution I could muster, nor all the
indignation I felt at my own weakness, prevented my stomach from
behaving in a most perverse way. I never succeeded in overcoming the
nausea produced by the smell of the oil. Even Wallace and Bruce proved
impotent here. But if I had to lose breakfast, or dinner, I had all
the better appetite for supper, and the allotted work was done. A real
disciple of Wallace or Bruce could not give up; he would die first.

My service with Mr. Hay was a distinct advance upon the cotton
factory, and I also made the acquaintance of an employer who was very
kind to me. Mr. Hay kept his books in single entry, and I was able to
handle them for him; but hearing that all great firms kept their books
in double entry, and after talking over the matter with my companions,
John Phipps, Thomas N. Miller, and William Cowley, we all determined
to attend night school during the winter and learn the larger system.
So the four of us went to a Mr. Williams in Pittsburgh and learned
double-entry bookkeeping.

One evening, early in 1850, when I returned home from work, I was told
that Mr. David Brooks, manager of the telegraph office, had asked my
Uncle Hogan if he knew where a good boy could be found to act as
messenger. Mr. Brooks and my uncle were enthusiastic draught-players,
and it was over a game of draughts that this important inquiry was
made. Upon such trifles do the most momentous consequences hang. A
word, a look, an accent, may affect the destiny not only of
individuals, but of nations. He is a bold man who calls anything a
trifle. Who was it who, being advised to disregard trifles, said he
always would if any one could tell him what a trifle was? The young
should remember that upon trifles the best gifts of the gods often
hang.

My uncle mentioned my name, and said he would see whether I would take
the position. I remember so well the family council that was held. Of
course I was wild with delight. No bird that ever was confined in a
cage longed for freedom more than I. Mother favored, but father was
disposed to deny my wish. It would prove too much for me, he said; I
was too young and too small. For the two dollars and a half per week
offered it was evident that a much larger boy was expected. Late at
night I might be required to run out into the country with a telegram,
and there would be dangers to encounter. Upon the whole my father said
that it was best that I should remain where I was. He subsequently
withdrew his objection, so far as to give me leave to try, and I
believe he went to Mr. Hay and consulted with him. Mr. Hay thought it
would be for my advantage, and although, as he said, it would be an
inconvenience to him, still he advised that I should try, and if I
failed he was kind enough to say that my old place would be open for
me.

This being decided, I was asked to go over the river to Pittsburgh and
call on Mr. Brooks. My father wished to go with me, and it was settled
that he should accompany me as far as the telegraph office, on the
corner of Fourth and Wood Streets. It was a bright, sunshiny morning
and this augured well. Father and I walked over from Allegheny to
Pittsburgh, a distance of nearly two miles from our house. Arrived at
the door I asked father to wait outside. I insisted upon going alone
upstairs to the second or operating floor to see the great man and
learn my fate. I was led to this, perhaps, because I had by that time
begun to consider myself something of an American. At first boys used
to call me "Scotchie! Scotchie!" and I answered, "Yes, I'm Scotch and
I am proud of the name." But in speech and in address the broad Scotch
had been worn off to a slight extent, and I imagined that I could
make a smarter showing if alone with Mr. Brooks than if my good old
Scotch father were present, perhaps to smile at my airs.

I was dressed in my one white linen shirt, which was usually kept
sacred for the Sabbath day, my blue round-about, and my whole Sunday
suit. I had at that time, and for a few weeks after I entered the
telegraph service, but one linen suit of summer clothing; and every
Saturday night, no matter if that was my night on duty and I did not
return till near midnight, my mother washed those clothes and ironed
them, and I put them on fresh on Sabbath morning. There was nothing
that heroine did not do in the struggle we were making for elbow room
in the western world. Father's long factory hours tried his strength,
but he, too, fought the good fight like a hero and never failed to
encourage me.

The interview was successful. I took care to explain that I did not
know Pittsburgh, that perhaps I would not do, would not be strong
enough; but all I wanted was a trial. He asked me how soon I could
come, and I said that I could stay now if wanted. And, looking back
over the circumstance, I think that answer might well be pondered by
young men. It is a great mistake not to seize the opportunity. The
position was offered to me; something might occur, some other boy
might be sent for. Having got myself in I proposed to stay there if I
could. Mr. Brooks very kindly called the other boy--for it was an
additional messenger that was wanted--and asked him to show me about,
and let me go with him and learn the business. I soon found
opportunity to run down to the corner of the street and tell my father
that it was all right, and to go home and tell mother that I had got
the situation.

[Illustration: DAVID McCARGO]

And that is how in 1850 I got my first real start in life. From the
dark cellar running a steam-engine at two dollars a week, begrimed
with coal dirt, without a trace of the elevating influences of life, I
was lifted into paradise, yes, heaven, as it seemed to me, with
newspapers, pens, pencils, and sunshine about me. There was scarcely a
minute in which I could not learn something or find out how much there
was to learn and how little I knew. I felt that my foot was upon the
ladder and that I was bound to climb.

I had only one fear, and that was that I could not learn quickly
enough the addresses of the various business houses to which messages
had to be delivered. I therefore began to note the signs of these
houses up one side of the street and down the other. At night I
exercised my memory by naming in succession the various firms. Before
long I could shut my eyes and, beginning at the foot of a business
street, call off the names of the firms in proper order along one side
to the top of the street, then crossing on the other side go down in
regular order to the foot again.

The next step was to know the men themselves, for it gave a messenger
a great advantage, and often saved a long journey, if he knew members
or employees of firms. He might meet one of these going direct to his
office. It was reckoned a great triumph among the boys to deliver a
message upon the street. And there was the additional satisfaction to
the boy himself, that a great man (and most men are great to
messengers), stopped upon the street in this way, seldom failed to
note the boy and compliment him.

The Pittsburgh of 1850 was very different from what it has since
become. It had not yet recovered from the great fire which destroyed
the entire business portion of the city on April 10, 1845. The houses
were mainly of wood, a few only were of brick, and not one was
fire-proof. The entire population in and around Pittsburgh was not
over forty thousand. The business portion of the city did not extend
as far as Fifth Avenue, which was then a very quiet street, remarkable
only for having the theater upon it. Federal Street, Allegheny,
consisted of straggling business houses with great open spaces between
them, and I remember skating upon ponds in the very heart of the
present Fifth Ward. The site of our Union Iron Mills was then, and
many years later, a cabbage garden.

General Robinson, to whom I delivered many a telegraph message, was
the first white child born west of the Ohio River. I saw the first
telegraph line stretched from the east into the city; and, at a later
date, I also saw the first locomotive, for the Ohio and Pennsylvania
Railroad, brought by canal from Philadelphia and unloaded from a scow
in Allegheny City. There was no direct railway communication to the
East. Passengers took the canal to the foot of the Allegheny
Mountains, over which they were transported to Hollidaysburg, a
distance of thirty miles by rail; thence by canal again to Columbia,
and then eighty-one miles by rail to Philadelphia--a journey which
occupied three days.[12]

[Footnote 12: "Beyond Philadelphia was the Camden and Amboy Railway;
beyond Pittsburgh, the Fort Wayne and Chicago, separate organizations
with which we had nothing to do." (_Problems of To-day_, by Andrew
Carnegie, p. 187. New York, 1908.)]

The great event of the day in Pittsburgh at that time was the arrival
and departure of the steam packet to and from Cincinnati, for daily
communication had been established. The business of the city was
largely that of forwarding merchandise East and West, for it was the
great transfer station from river to canal. A rolling mill had begun
to roll iron; but not a ton of pig metal was made, and not a ton of
steel for many a year thereafter. The pig iron manufacture at first
was a total failure because of the lack of proper fuel, although the
most valuable deposit of coking coal in the world lay within a few
miles, as much undreamt of for coke to smelt ironstone as the stores
of natural gas which had for ages lain untouched under the city.

There were at that time not half a dozen "carriage" people in the
town; and not for many years after was the attempt made to introduce
livery, even for a coachman. As late as 1861, perhaps, the most
notable financial event which had occurred in the annals of Pittsburgh
was the retirement from business of Mr. Fahnestock with the enormous
sum of $174,000, paid by his partners for his interest. How great a
sum that seemed then and how trifling now!

My position as messenger boy soon made me acquainted with the few
leading men of the city. The bar of Pittsburgh was distinguished.
Judge Wilkins was at its head, and he and Judge MacCandless, Judge
McClure, Charles Shaler and his partner, Edwin M. Stanton, afterwards
the great War Secretary ("Lincoln's right-hand man") were all well
known to me--the last-named especially, for he was good enough to take
notice of me as a boy. In business circles among prominent men who
still survive, Thomas M. Howe, James Park, C.G. Hussey, Benjamin F.
Jones, William Thaw, John Chalfant, Colonel Herron were great men to
whom the messenger boys looked as models, and not bad models either,
as their lives proved. [Alas! all dead as I revise this paragraph in
1906, so steadily moves the solemn procession.]

My life as a telegraph messenger was in every respect a happy one,
and it was while in this position that I laid the foundation of my
closest friendships. The senior messenger boy being promoted, a new
boy was needed, and he came in the person of David McCargo, afterwards
the well-known superintendent of the Allegheny Valley Railway. He was
made my companion and we had to deliver all the messages from the
Eastern line, while two other boys delivered the messages from the
West. The Eastern and Western Telegraph Companies were then separate,
although occupying the same building. "Davy" and I became firm friends
at once, one great bond being that he was Scotch; for, although "Davy"
was born in America, his father was quite as much a Scotsman, even in
speech, as my own father.

A short time after "Davy's" appointment a third boy was required, and
this time I was asked if I could find a suitable one. This I had no
difficulty in doing in my chum, Robert Pitcairn, later on my successor
as superintendent and general agent at Pittsburgh of the Pennsylvania
Railroad. Robert, like myself, was not only Scotch, but Scotch-born,
so that "Davy," "Bob," and "Andy" became the three Scotch boys who
delivered all the messages of the Eastern Telegraph Line in
Pittsburgh, for the then magnificent salary of two and a half dollars
per week. It was the duty of the boys to sweep the office each
morning, and this we did in turn, so it will be seen that we all began
at the bottom. Hon. H.W. Oliver,[13] head of the great manufacturing
firm of Oliver Brothers, and W.C. Morland,[14] City Solicitor,
subsequently joined the corps and started in the same fashion. It is
not the rich man's son that the young struggler for advancement has to
fear in the race of life, nor his nephew, nor his cousin. Let him look
out for the "dark horse" in the boy who begins by sweeping out the
office.

[Footnote 13: Died 1904.]

[Footnote 14: Died 1889.]

[Illustration: ROBERT PITCAIRN]

A messenger boy in those days had many pleasures. There were wholesale
fruit stores, where a pocketful of apples was sometimes to be had for
the prompt delivery of a message; bakers' and confectioners' shops,
where sweet cakes were sometimes given to him. He met with very kind
men, to whom he looked up with respect; they spoke a pleasant word and
complimented him on his promptness, perhaps asked him to deliver a
message on the way back to the office. I do not know a situation in
which a boy is more apt to attract attention, which is all a really
clever boy requires in order to rise. Wise men are always looking out
for clever boys.

One great excitement of this life was the extra charge of ten cents
which we were permitted to collect for messages delivered beyond a
certain limit. These "dime messages," as might be expected, were
anxiously watched, and quarrels arose among us as to the right of
delivery. In some cases it was alleged boys had now and then taken a
dime message out of turn. This was the only cause of serious trouble
among us. By way of settlement I proposed that we should "pool" these
messages and divide the cash equally at the end of each week. I was
appointed treasurer. Peace and good-humor reigned ever afterwards.
This pooling of extra earnings not being intended to create artificial
prices was really coöperation. It was my first essay in financial
organization.

The boys considered that they had a perfect right to spend these
dividends, and the adjoining confectioner's shop had running accounts
with most of them. The accounts were sometimes greatly overdrawn. The
treasurer had accordingly to notify the confectioner, which he did in
due form, that he would not be responsible for any debts contracted by
the too hungry and greedy boys. Robert Pitcairn was the worst offender
of all, apparently having not only one sweet tooth, but all his teeth
of that character. He explained to me confidentially one day, when I
scolded him, that he had live things in his stomach that gnawed his
insides until fed upon sweets.




CHAPTER IV

COLONEL ANDERSON AND BOOKS


With all their pleasures the messenger boys were hard worked. Every
other evening they were required to be on duty until the office
closed, and on these nights it was seldom that I reached home before
eleven o'clock. On the alternating nights we were relieved at six.
This did not leave much time for self-improvement, nor did the wants
of the family leave any money to spend on books. There came, however,
like a blessing from above, a means by which the treasures of
literature were unfolded to me.

Colonel James Anderson--I bless his name as I write--announced that he
would open his library of four hundred volumes to boys, so that any
young man could take out, each Saturday afternoon, a book which could
be exchanged for another on the succeeding Saturday. My friend, Mr.
Thomas N. Miller, reminded me recently that Colonel Anderson's books
were first opened to "working boys," and the question arose whether
messenger boys, clerks, and others, who did not work with their hands,
were entitled to books. My first communication to the press was a
note, written to the "Pittsburgh Dispatch," urging that we should not
be excluded; that although we did not now work with our hands, some of
us had done so, and that we were really working boys.[15] Dear Colonel
Anderson promptly enlarged the classification. So my first appearance
as a public writer was a success.

[Footnote 15: The note was signed "Working Boy." The librarian
responded in the columns of the _Dispatch_ defending the rules, which
he claimed meant that "a Working Boy should have a trade." Carnegie's
rejoinder was signed "A Working Boy, though without a Trade," and a
day or two thereafter the _Dispatch_ had an item on its editorial page
which read: "Will 'a Working Boy without a Trade' please call at this
office." (David Homer Bates in _Century Magazine_, July, 1908.)]

My dear friend, Tom Miller, one of the inner circle, lived near
Colonel Anderson and introduced me to him, and in this way the windows
were opened in the walls of my dungeon through which the light of
knowledge streamed in. Every day's toil and even the long hours of
night service were lightened by the book which I carried about with me
and read in the intervals that could be snatched from duty. And the
future was made bright by the thought that when Saturday came a new
volume could be obtained. In this way I became familiar with
Macaulay's essays and his history, and with Bancroft's "History of the
United States," which I studied with more care than any other book I
had then read. Lamb's essays were my special delight, but I had at
this time no knowledge of the great master of all, Shakespeare, beyond
the selected pieces in the school books. My taste for him I acquired a
little later at the old Pittsburgh Theater.

John Phipps, James R. Wilson, Thomas N. Miller, William
Cowley--members of our circle--shared with me the invaluable privilege
of the use of Colonel Anderson's library. Books which it would have
been impossible for me to obtain elsewhere were, by his wise
generosity, placed within my reach; and to him I owe a taste for
literature which I would not exchange for all the millions that were
ever amassed by man. Life would be quite intolerable without it.
Nothing contributed so much to keep my companions and myself clear of
low fellowship and bad habits as the beneficence of the good
Colonel. Later, when fortune smiled upon me, one of my first duties
was the erection of a monument to my benefactor. It stands in front of
the Hall and Library in Diamond Square, which I presented to
Allegheny, and bears this inscription:

     To Colonel James Anderson, Founder of Free Libraries in
     Western Pennsylvania. He opened his Library to working boys
     and upon Saturday afternoons acted as librarian, thus
     dedicating not only his books but himself to the noble work.
     This monument is erected in grateful remembrance by Andrew
     Carnegie, one of the "working boys" to whom were thus opened
     the precious treasures of knowledge and imagination through
     which youth may ascend.

[Illustration: COLONEL JAMES ANDERSON]

This is but a slight tribute and gives only a faint idea of the depth
of gratitude which I feel for what he did for me and my companions. It
was from my own early experience that I decided there was no use to
which money could be applied so productive of good to boys and girls
who have good within them and ability and ambition to develop it, as
the founding of a public library in a community which is willing to
support it as a municipal institution. I am sure that the future of
those libraries I have been privileged to found will prove the
correctness of this opinion. For if one boy in each library district,
by having access to one of these libraries, is half as much benefited
as I was by having access to Colonel Anderson's four hundred well-worn
volumes, I shall consider they have not been established in vain.

"As the twig is bent the tree's inclined." The treasures of the world
which books contain were opened to me at the right moment. The
fundamental advantage of a library is that it gives nothing for
nothing. Youths must acquire knowledge themselves. There is no escape
from this. It gave me great satisfaction to discover, many years
later, that my father was one of the five weavers in Dunfermline who
gathered together the few books they had and formed the first
circulating library in that town.

The history of that library is interesting. It grew, and was removed
no less than seven times from place to place, the first move being
made by the founders, who carried the books in their aprons and two
coal scuttles from the hand-loom shop to the second resting-place.
That my father was one of the founders of the first library in his
native town, and that I have been fortunate enough to be the founder
of the last one, is certainly to me one of the most interesting
incidents of my life. I have said often, in public speeches, that I
had never heard of a lineage for which I would exchange that of a
library-founding weaver.[16] I followed my father in library founding
unknowingly--I am tempted almost to say providentially--and it has
been a source of intense satisfaction to me. Such a father as mine was
a guide to be followed--one of the sweetest, purest, and kindest
natures I have ever known.

[Footnote 16: "It's a God's mercy we are all from honest weavers; let
us pity those who haven't ancestors of whom they can be proud, dukes
or duchesses though they be." (_Our Coaching Trip_, by Andrew
Carnegie. New York, 1882.)]

I have stated that it was the theater which first stimulated my love
for Shakespeare. In my messenger days the old Pittsburgh Theater was
in its glory under the charge of Mr. Foster. His telegraphic business
was done free, and the telegraph operators were given free admission
to the theater in return. This privilege extended in some degree also
to the messengers, who, I fear, sometimes withheld telegrams that
arrived for him in the late afternoon until they could be presented
at the door of the theater in the evening, with the timid request
that the messenger might be allowed to slip upstairs to the second
tier--a request which was always granted. The boys exchanged duties to
give each the coveted entrance in turn.

In this way I became acquainted with the world that lay behind the
green curtain. The plays, generally, were of the spectacular order;
without much literary merit, but well calculated to dazzle the eye of
a youth of fifteen. Not only had I never seen anything so grand, but I
had never seen anything of the kind. I had never been in a theater, or
even a concert room, or seen any form of public amusement. It was much
the same with "Davy" McCargo, "Harry" Oliver, and "Bob" Pitcairn. We
all fell under the fascination of the footlights, and every
opportunity to attend the theater was eagerly embraced.

A change in my tastes came when "Gust" Adams,[17] one of the most
celebrated tragedians of the day, began to play in Pittsburgh a round
of Shakespearean characters. Thenceforth there was nothing for me but
Shakespeare. I seemed to be able to memorize him almost without
effort. Never before had I realized what magic lay in words. The
rhythm and the melody all seemed to find a resting-place in me, to
melt into a solid mass which lay ready to come at call. It was a new
language and its appreciation I certainly owe to dramatic
representation, for, until I saw "Macbeth" played, my interest in
Shakespeare was not aroused. I had not read the plays.

[Footnote 17: Edwin Adams.]

At a much later date, Wagner was revealed to me in "Lohengrin." I had
heard at the Academy of Music in New York, little or nothing by him
when the overture to "Lohengrin" thrilled me as a new revelation.
Here was a genius, indeed, differing from all before, a new ladder
upon which to climb upward--like Shakespeare, a new friend.

I may speak here of another matter which belongs to this same period.
A few persons in Allegheny--probably not above a hundred in all--had
formed themselves into a Swedenborgian Society, in which our American
relatives were prominent. My father attended that church after leaving
the Presbyterian, and, of course, I was taken there. My mother,
however, took no interest in Swedenborg. Although always inculcating
respect for all forms of religion, and discouraging theological
disputes, she maintained for herself a marked reserve. Her position
might best be defined by the celebrated maxim of Confucius: "To
perform the duties of this life well, troubling not about another, is
the prime wisdom."

She encouraged her boys to attend church and Sunday school; but there
was no difficulty in seeing that the writings of Swedenborg, and much
of the Old and New Testaments had been discredited by her as unworthy
of divine authorship or of acceptance as authoritative guides for the
conduct of life. I became deeply interested in the mysterious
doctrines of Swedenborg, and received the congratulations of my devout
Aunt Aitken upon my ability to expound "spiritual sense." That dear
old woman fondly looked forward to a time when I should become a
shining light in the New Jerusalem, and I know it was sometimes not
beyond the bounds of her imagination that I might blossom into what
she called a "preacher of the Word."

As I more and more wandered from man-made theology these fond hopes
weakened, but my aunt's interest in and affection for her first
nephew, whom she had dandled on her knee in Scotland, never waned. My
cousin, Leander Morris, whom she had some hopes of saving through the
Swedenborgian revelation, grievously disappointed her by actually
becoming a Baptist and being dipped. This was too much for the
evangelist, although she should have remembered her father passed
through that same experience and often preached for the Baptists in
Edinburgh.

Leander's reception upon his first call after his fall was far from
cordial. He was made aware that the family record had suffered by his
backsliding when at the very portals of the New Jerusalem revealed by
Swedenborg and presented to him by one of the foremost disciples--his
aunt. He began deprecatingly:

"Why are you so hard on me, aunt? Look at Andy, he is not a member of
any church and you don't scold him. Surely the Baptist Church is
better than none."

The quick reply came:

"Andy! Oh! Andy, he's naked, but you are clothed in rags."

He never quite regained his standing with dear Aunt Aitken. I might
yet be reformed, being unattached; but Leander had chosen a sect and
that sect not of the New Jerusalem.

It was in connection with the Swedenborgian Society that a taste for
music was first aroused in me. As an appendix to the hymn-book of the
society there were short selections from the oratorios. I fastened
instinctively upon these, and although denied much of a voice, yet
credited with "expression," I was a constant attendant upon choir
practice. The leader, Mr. Koethen, I have reason to believe, often
pardoned the discords I produced in the choir because of my enthusiasm
in the cause. When, at a later date, I became acquainted with the
oratorios in full, it was a pleasure to find that several of those
considered in musical circles as the gems of Handel's musical
compositions were the ones that I as an ignorant boy had chosen as
favorites. So the beginning of my musical education dates from the
small choir of the Swedenborgian Society of Pittsburgh.

I must not, however, forget that a very good foundation was laid for
my love of sweet sounds in the unsurpassed minstrelsy of my native
land as sung by my father. There was scarcely an old Scottish song
with which I was not made familiar, both words and tune. Folk-songs
are the best possible foundation for sure progress to the heights of
Beethoven and Wagner. My father being one of the sweetest and most
pathetic singers I ever heard, I probably inherited his love of music
and of song, though not given his voice. Confucius' exclamation often
sounds in my ears: "Music, sacred tongue of God! I hear thee calling
and I come."

An incident of this same period exhibits the liberality of my parents
in another matter. As a messenger boy I had no holidays, with the
exception of two weeks given me in the summer-time, which I spent
boating on the river with cousins at my uncle's at East Liverpool,
Ohio. I was very fond of skating, and in the winter about which I am
speaking, the slack water of the river opposite our house was
beautifully frozen over. The ice was in splendid condition, and
reaching home late Saturday night the question arose whether I might
be permitted to rise early in the morning and go skating before church
hours. No question of a more serious character could have been
submitted to ordinary Scottish parents. My mother was clear on the
subject, that in the circumstances I should be allowed to skate as
long as I liked. My father said he believed it was right I should go
down and skate, but he hoped I would be back in time to go with him to
church.

I suppose this decision would be arrived at to-day by nine hundred and
ninety-nine out of every thousand homes in America, and probably also
in the majority of homes in England, though not in Scotland. But those
who hold to-day that the Sabbath in its fullest sense was made for
man, and who would open picture galleries and museums to the public,
and make the day somewhat of a day of enjoyment for the masses instead
of pressing upon them the duty of mourning over sins largely
imaginary, are not more advanced than were my parents forty years ago.
They were beyond the orthodox of the period when it was scarcely
permissible, at least among the Scotch, to take a walk for pleasure or
read any but religious books on the Sabbath.




CHAPTER V

THE TELEGRAPH OFFICE


I had served as messenger about a year, when Colonel John P. Glass,
the manager of the downstairs office, who came in contact with the
public, began selecting me occasionally to watch the office for a few
minutes during his absence. As Mr. Glass was a highly popular man, and
had political aspirations, these periods of absence became longer and
more frequent, so that I soon became an adept in his branch of the
work. I received messages from the public and saw that those that came
from the operating-room were properly assigned to the boys for prompt
delivery.

This was a trying position for a boy to fill, and at that time I was
not popular with the other boys, who resented my exemption from part
of my legitimate work. I was also taxed with being penurious in my
habits--mean, as the boys had it. I did not spend my extra dimes, but
they knew not the reason. Every penny that I could save I knew was
needed at home. My parents were wise and nothing was withheld from me.
I knew every week the receipts of each of the three who were
working--my father, my mother, and myself. I also knew all the
expenditures. We consulted upon the additions that could be made to
our scanty stock of furniture and clothing and every new small article
obtained was a source of joy. There never was a family more united.

Day by day, as mother could spare a silver half-dollar, it was
carefully placed in a stocking and hid until two hundred were
gathered, when I obtained a draft to repay the twenty pounds so
generously lent to us by her friend Mrs. Henderson. That was a day we
celebrated. The Carnegie family was free from debt. Oh, the happiness
of that day! The debt was, indeed, discharged, but the debt of
gratitude remains that never can be paid. Old Mrs. Henderson lives
to-day. I go to her house as to a shrine, to see her upon my visits to
Dunfermline; and whatever happens she can never be forgotten. [As I
read these lines, written some years ago, I moan, "Gone, gone with the
others!" Peace to the ashes of a dear, good, noble friend of my
mother's.]

The incident in my messenger life which at once lifted me to the
seventh heaven, occurred one Saturday evening when Colonel Glass was
paying the boys their month's wages. We stood in a row before the
counter, and Mr. Glass paid each one in turn. I was at the head and
reached out my hand for the first eleven and a quarter dollars as they
were pushed out by Mr. Glass. To my surprise he pushed them past me
and paid the next boy. I thought it was a mistake, for I had
heretofore been paid first, but it followed in turn with each of the
other boys. My heart began to sink within me. Disgrace seemed coming.
What had I done or not done? I was about to be told that there was no
more work for me. I was to disgrace the family. That was the keenest
pang of all. When all had been paid and the boys were gone, Mr. Glass
took me behind the counter and said that I was worth more than the
other boys, and he had resolved to pay me thirteen and a half dollars
a month.

My head swam; I doubted whether I had heard him correctly. He counted
out the money. I don't know whether I thanked him; I don't believe I
did. I took it and made one bound for the door and scarcely stopped
until I got home. I remember distinctly running or rather bounding
from end to end of the bridge across the Allegheny River--inside on
the wagon track because the foot-walk was too narrow. It was Saturday
night. I handed over to mother, who was the treasurer of the family,
the eleven dollars and a quarter and said nothing about the remaining
two dollars and a quarter in my pocket--worth more to me then than all
the millions I have made since.

Tom, a little boy of nine, and myself slept in the attic together, and
after we were safely in bed I whispered the secret to my dear little
brother. Even at his early age he knew what it meant, and we talked
over the future. It was then, for the first time, I sketched to him
how we would go into business together; that the firm of "Carnegie
Brothers" would be a great one, and that father and mother should yet
ride in their carriage. At the time that seemed to us to embrace
everything known as wealth and most of what was worth striving for.
The old Scotch woman, whose daughter married a merchant in London,
being asked by her son-in-law to come to London and live near them,
promising she should "ride in her carriage," replied:

"What good could it do me to ride in a carriage gin I could na be seen
by the folk in Strathbogie?" Father and mother would not only be seen
in Pittsburgh, but should visit Dunfermline, their old home, in style.

On Sunday morning with father, mother, and Tom at breakfast, I
produced the extra two dollars and a quarter. The surprise was great
and it took some moments for them to grasp the situation, but it soon
dawned upon them. Then father's glance of loving pride and mother's
blazing eye soon wet with tears, told their feeling. It was their
boy's first triumph and proof positive that he was worthy of
promotion. No subsequent success, or recognition of any kind, ever
thrilled me as this did. I cannot even imagine one that could. Here
was heaven upon earth. My whole world was moved to tears of joy.

Having to sweep out the operating-room in the mornings, the boys had
an opportunity of practicing upon the telegraph instruments before the
operators arrived. This was a new chance. I soon began to play with
the key and to talk with the boys who were at the other stations who
had like purposes to my own. Whenever one learns to do anything he has
never to wait long for an opportunity of putting his knowledge to use.

One morning I heard the Pittsburgh call given with vigor. It seemed to
me I could divine that some one wished greatly to communicate. I
ventured to answer, and let the slip run. It was Philadelphia that
wanted to send "a death message" to Pittsburgh immediately. Could I
take it? I replied that I would try if they would send slowly. I
succeeded in getting the message and ran out with it. I waited
anxiously for Mr. Brooks to come in, and told him what I had dared to
do. Fortunately, he appreciated it and complimented me, instead of
scolding me for my temerity; yet dismissing me with the admonition to
be very careful and not to make mistakes. It was not long before I was
called sometimes to watch the instrument, while the operator wished to
be absent, and in this way I learned the art of telegraphy.

We were blessed at this time with a rather indolent operator, who was
only too glad to have me do his work. It was then the practice for us
to receive the messages on a running slip of paper, from which the
operator read to a copyist, but rumors had reached us that a man in
the West had learned to read by sound and could really take a message
by ear. This led me to practice the new method. One of the operators
in the office, Mr. Maclean, became expert at it, and encouraged me by
his success. I was surprised at the ease with which I learned the new
language. One day, desiring to take a message in the absence of the
operator, the old gentleman who acted as copyist resented my
presumption and refused to "copy" for a messenger boy. I shut off the
paper slip, took pencil and paper and began taking the message by ear.
I shall never forget his surprise. He ordered me to give him back his
pencil and pad, and after that there was never any difficulty between
dear old Courtney Hughes and myself. He was my devoted friend and
copyist.

Soon after this incident Joseph Taylor, the operator at Greensburg,
thirty miles from Pittsburgh, wishing to be absent for two weeks,
asked Mr. Brooks if he could not send some one to take his place. Mr.
Brooks called me and asked whether I thought I could do the work. I
replied at once in the affirmative.

"Well," he said, "we will send you out there for a trial."

I went out in the mail stage and had a most delightful trip. Mr. David
Bruce, a well-known solicitor of Scottish ancestry, and his sister
happened to be passengers. It was my first excursion, and my first
glimpse of the country. The hotel at Greensburg was the first public
house in which I had ever taken a meal. I thought the food wonderfully
fine.

[Illustration: HENRY PHIPPS]

This was in 1852. Deep cuts and embankments near Greensburg were then
being made for the Pennsylvania Railroad, and I often walked out in
the early morning to see the work going forward, little dreaming that
I was so soon to enter the service of that great corporation. This
was the first responsible position I had occupied in the telegraph
service, and I was so anxious to be at hand in case I should be
needed, that one night very late I sat in the office during a storm,
not wishing to cut off the connection. I ventured too near the key and
for my boldness was knocked off my stool. A flash of lightning very
nearly ended my career. After that I was noted in the office for
caution during lightning storms. I succeeded in doing the small
business at Greensburg to the satisfaction of my superiors, and
returned to Pittsburgh surrounded with something like a halo, so far
as the other boys were concerned. Promotion soon came. A new operator
was wanted and Mr. Brooks telegraphed to my afterward dear friend
James D. Reid, then general superintendent of the line, another fine
specimen of the Scotsman, and took upon himself to recommend me as an
assistant operator. The telegram from Louisville in reply stated that
Mr. Reid highly approved of promoting "Andy," provided Mr. Brooks
considered him competent. The result was that I began as a telegraph
operator at the tremendous salary of twenty-five dollars per month,
which I thought a fortune. To Mr. Brooks and Mr. Reid I owe my
promotion from the messenger's station to the operating-room.[18] I
was then in my seventeenth year and had served my apprenticeship. I
was now performing a man's part, no longer a boy's--earning a dollar
every working day.

[Footnote 18: "I liked the boy's looks, and it was very easy to see
that though he was little he was full of spirit. He had not been with
me a month when he began to ask whether I would teach him to
telegraph. I began to instruct him and found him an apt pupil." (James
D. Reid, _The Telegraph in America_, New York, 1879.)

Reid was born near Dunfermline and forty years afterwards Mr. Carnegie
was able to secure for him the appointment of United States Consul at
Dunfermline.]

The operating-room of a telegraph office is an excellent school for a
young man. He there has to do with pencil and paper, with composition
and invention. And there my slight knowledge of British and European
affairs soon stood me in good stead. Knowledge is sure to prove useful
in one way or another. It always tells. The foreign news was then
received by wire from Cape Race, and the taking of successive "steamer
news" was one of the most notable of our duties. I liked this better
than any other branch of the work, and it was soon tacitly assigned to
me.

The lines in those days worked poorly, and during a storm much had to
be guessed at. My guessing powers were said to be phenomenal, and it
was my favorite diversion to fill up gaps instead of interrupting the
sender and spending minutes over a lost word or two. This was not a
dangerous practice in regard to foreign news, for if any undue
liberties were taken by the bold operator, they were not of a
character likely to bring him into serious trouble. My knowledge of
foreign affairs became somewhat extensive, especially regarding the
affairs of Britain, and my guesses were quite safe, if I got the first
letter or two right.

The Pittsburgh newspapers had each been in the habit of sending a
reporter to the office to transcribe the press dispatches. Later on
one man was appointed for all the papers and he suggested that
multiple copies could readily be made of the news as received, and it
was arranged that I should make five copies of all press dispatches
for him as extra work for which he was to pay me a dollar per week.
This, my first work for the press, yielded very modest remuneration,
to be sure; but it made my salary thirty dollars per month, and every
dollar counted in those days. The family was gradually gaining
ground; already future millionairedom seemed dawning.

Another step which exercised a decided influence over me was joining
the "Webster Literary Society" along with my companions, the trusty
five already named. We formed a select circle and stuck closely
together. This was quite an advantage for all of us. We had before
this formed a small debating club which met in Mr. Phipps's father's
room in which his few journeymen shoemakers worked during the day. Tom
Miller recently alleged that I once spoke nearly an hour and a half
upon the question, "Should the judiciary be elected by the people?"
but we must mercifully assume his memory to be at fault. The "Webster"
was then the foremost club in the city and proud were we to be thought
fit for membership. We had merely been preparing ourselves in the
cobbler's room.

I know of no better mode of benefiting a youth than joining such a
club as this. Much of my reading became such as had a bearing on
forthcoming debates and that gave clearness and fixity to my ideas.
The self-possession I afterwards came to have before an audience may
very safely be attributed to the experience of the "Webster Society."
My two rules for speaking then (and now) were: Make yourself perfectly
at home before your audience, and simply talk _to_ them, not _at_
them. Do not try to be somebody else; be your own self and _talk_,
never "orate" until you can't help it.

I finally became an operator by sound, discarding printing entirely.
The accomplishment was then so rare that people visited the office to
be satisfied of the extraordinary feat. This brought me into such
notice that when a great flood destroyed all telegraph communication
between Steubenville and Wheeling, a distance of twenty-five miles, I
was sent to the former town to receive the entire business then
passing between the East and the West, and to send every hour or two
the dispatches in small boats down the river to Wheeling. In exchange
every returning boat brought rolls of dispatches which I wired East,
and in this way for more than a week the entire telegraphic
communication between the East and the West _via_ Pittsburgh was
maintained.

While at Steubenville I learned that my father was going to Wheeling
and Cincinnati to sell the tablecloths he had woven. I waited for the
boat, which did not arrive till late in the evening, and went down to
meet him. I remember how deeply affected I was on finding that instead
of taking a cabin passage, he had resolved not to pay the price, but
to go down the river as a deck passenger. I was indignant that one of
so fine a nature should be compelled to travel thus. But there was
comfort in saying:

"Well, father, it will not be long before mother and you shall ride in
your carriage."

My father was usually shy, reserved, and keenly sensitive, very saving
of praise (a Scotch trait) lest his sons might be too greatly
uplifted; but when touched he lost his self-control. He was so upon
this occasion, and grasped my hand with a look which I often see and
can never forget. He murmured slowly:

"Andra, I am proud of you."

The voice trembled and he seemed ashamed of himself for saying so
much. The tear had to be wiped from his eye, I fondly noticed, as he
bade me good-night and told me to run back to my office. Those words
rang in my ear and warmed my heart for years and years. We understood
each other. How reserved the Scot is! Where he feels most he
expresses least. Quite right. There are holy depths which it is
sacrilege to disturb. Silence is more eloquent than words. My father
was one of the most lovable of men, beloved of his companions, deeply
religious, although non-sectarian and non-theological, not much of a
man of the world, but a man all over for heaven. He was kindness
itself, although reserved. Alas! he passed away soon after returning
from this Western tour just as we were becoming able to give him a
life of leisure and comfort.

After my return to Pittsburgh it was not long before I made the
acquaintance of an extraordinary man, Thomas A. Scott, one to whom the
term "genius" in his department may safely be applied. He had come to
Pittsburgh as superintendent of that division of the Pennsylvania
Railroad. Frequent telegraphic communication was necessary between him
and his superior, Mr. Lombaert, general superintendent at Altoona.
This brought him to the telegraph office at nights, and upon several
occasions I happened to be the operator. One day I was surprised by
one of his assistants, with whom I was acquainted, telling me that Mr.
Scott had asked him whether he thought that I could be obtained as his
clerk and telegraph operator, to which this young man told me he had
replied:

"That is impossible. He is now an operator."

But when I heard this I said at once:

"Not so fast. He can have me. I want to get out of a mere office life.
Please go and tell him so."

The result was I was engaged February 1, 1853, at a salary of
thirty-five dollars a month as Mr. Scott's clerk and operator. A raise
in wages from twenty-five to thirty-five dollars per month was the
greatest I had ever known. The public telegraph line was temporarily
put into Mr. Scott's office at the outer depot and the Pennsylvania
Railroad Company was given permission to use the wire at seasons when
such use would not interfere with the general public business, until
their own line, then being built, was completed.




CHAPTER VI

RAILROAD SERVICE


From the operating-room of the telegraph office I had now stepped into
the open world, and the change at first was far from agreeable. I had
just reached my eighteenth birthday, and I do not see how it could be
possible for any boy to arrive at that age much freer from a knowledge
of anything but what was pure and good. I do not believe, up to that
time, I had ever spoken a bad word in my life and seldom heard one. I
knew nothing of the base and the vile. Fortunately I had always been
brought in contact with good people.

I was now plunged at once into the company of coarse men, for the
office was temporarily only a portion of the shops and the
headquarters for the freight conductors, brakemen, and firemen. All of
them had access to the same room with Superintendent Scott and myself,
and they availed themselves of it. This was a different world, indeed,
from that to which I had been accustomed. I was not happy about it. I
ate, necessarily, of the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and
evil for the first time. But there were still the sweet and pure
surroundings of home, where nothing coarse or wicked ever entered, and
besides, there was the world in which I dwelt with my companions, all
of them refined young men, striving to improve themselves and become
respected citizens. I passed through this phase of my life detesting
what was foreign to my nature and my early education. The experience
with coarse men was probably beneficial because it gave me a "scunner"
(disgust), to use a Scotism, at chewing or smoking tobacco, also at
swearing or the use of improper language, which fortunately remained
with me through life.

I do not wish to suggest that the men of whom I have spoken were
really degraded or bad characters. The habit of swearing, with coarse
talk, chewing and smoking tobacco, and snuffing were more prevalent
then than to-day and meant less than in this age. Railroading was new,
and many rough characters were attracted to it from the river service.
But many of the men were fine young fellows who have lived to be
highly respectable citizens and to occupy responsible positions. And I
must say that one and all of them were most kind to me. Many are yet
living from whom I hear occasionally and regard with affection. A
change came at last when Mr. Scott had his own office which he and I
occupied.

I was soon sent by Mr. Scott to Altoona to get the monthly pay-rolls
and checks. The railroad line was not completed over the Allegheny
Mountains at that time, and I had to pass over the inclined planes
which made the journey a remarkable one to me. Altoona was then
composed of a few houses built by the company. The shops were under
construction and there was nothing of the large city which now
occupies the site. It was there that I saw for the first time the
great man in our railroad field--Mr. Lombaert, general superintendent.
His secretary at that time was my friend, Robert Pitcairn, for whom I
had obtained a situation on the railroad, so that "Davy," "Bob," and
"Andy" were still together in the same service. We had all left the
telegraph company for the Pennsylvania Railroad Company.

Mr. Lombaert was very different from Mr. Scott; he was not sociable,
but rather stern and unbending. Judge then of Robert's surprise, and
my own, when, after saying a few words to me, Mr. Lombaert added: "You
must come down and take tea with us to-night." I stammered out
something of acceptance and awaited the appointed hour with great
trepidation. Up to this time I considered that invitation the greatest
honor I had received. Mrs. Lombaert was exceedingly kind, and Mr.
Lombaert's introduction of me to her was: "This is Mr. Scott's
'Andy.'" I was very proud indeed of being recognized as belonging to
Mr. Scott.

An incident happened on this trip which might have blasted my career
for a time. I started next morning for Pittsburgh with the pay-rolls
and checks, as I thought, securely placed under my waistcoat, as it
was too large a package for my pockets. I was a very enthusiastic
railroader at that time and preferred riding upon the engine. I got
upon the engine that took me to Hollidaysburg where the State railroad
over the mountain was joined up. It was a very rough ride, indeed, and
at one place, uneasily feeling for the pay-roll package, I was
horrified to find that the jolting of the train had shaken it out. I
had lost it!

There was no use in disguising the fact that such a failure would ruin
me. To have been sent for the pay-rolls and checks and to lose the
package, which I should have "grasped as my honor," was a dreadful
showing. I called the engineer and told him it must have been shaken
out within the last few miles. Would he reverse his engine and run
back for it? Kind soul, he did so. I watched the line, and on the very
banks of a large stream, within a few feet of the water, I saw that
package lying. I could scarcely believe my eyes. I ran down and
grasped it. It was all right. Need I add that it never passed out of
my firm grasp again until it was safe in Pittsburgh? The engineer and
fireman were the only persons who knew of my carelessness, and I had
their assurance that it would not be told.

It was long after the event that I ventured to tell the story. Suppose
that package had fallen just a few feet farther away and been swept
down by the stream, how many years of faithful service would it have
required upon my part to wipe out the effect of that one piece of
carelessness! I could no longer have enjoyed the confidence of those
whose confidence was essential to success had fortune not favored me.
I have never since believed in being too hard on a young man, even if
he does commit a dreadful mistake or two; and I have always tried in
judging such to remember the difference it would have made in my own
career but for an accident which restored to me that lost package at
the edge of the stream a few miles from Hollidaysburg. I could go
straight to the very spot to-day, and often as I passed over that line
afterwards I never failed to see that light-brown package lying upon
the bank. It seemed to be calling:

"All right, my boy! the good gods were with you, but don't do it
again!"

At an early age I became a strong anti-slavery partisan and hailed
with enthusiasm the first national meeting of the Republican Party in
Pittsburgh, February 22, 1856, although too young to vote. I watched
the prominent men as they walked the streets, lost in admiration for
Senators Wilson, Hale, and others. Some time before I had organized
among the railroad men a club of a hundred for the "New York Weekly
Tribune," and ventured occasionally upon short notes to the great
editor, Horace Greeley, who did so much to arouse the people to action
upon this vital question.

The first time I saw my work in type in the then flaming organ of
freedom certainly marked a stage in my career. I kept that "Tribune"
for years. Looking back to-day one cannot help regretting so high a
price as the Civil War had to be paid to free our land from the curse,
but it was not slavery alone that needed abolition. The loose Federal
system with State rights so prominent would inevitably have prevented,
or at least long delayed, the formation of one solid, all-powerful,
central government. The tendency under the Southern idea was
centrifugal. To-day it is centripetal, all drawn toward the center
under the sway of the Supreme Court, the decisions of which are, very
properly, half the dicta of lawyers and half the work of statesmen.
Uniformity in many fields must be secured. Marriage, divorce,
bankruptcy, railroad supervision, control of corporations, and some
other departments should in some measure be brought under one head.
[Re-reading this paragraph to-day, July, 1907, written many years ago,
it seems prophetic. These are now burning questions.]

It was not long after this that the railroad company constructed its
own telegraph line. We had to supply it with operators. Most of these
were taught in our offices at Pittsburgh. The telegraph business
continued to increase with startling rapidity. We could scarcely
provide facilities fast enough. New telegraph offices were required.
My fellow messenger-boy, "Davy" McCargo, I appointed superintendent of
the telegraph department March 11, 1859. I have been told that "Davy"
and myself are entitled to the credit of being the first to employ
young women as telegraph operators in the United States upon
railroads, or perhaps in any branch. At all events, we placed girls in
various offices as pupils, taught and then put them in charge of
offices as occasion required. Among the first of these was my cousin,
Miss Maria Hogan. She was the operator at the freight station in
Pittsburgh, and with her were placed successive pupils, her office
becoming a school. Our experience was that young women operators were
more to be relied upon than young men. Among all the new occupations
invaded by women I do not know of any better suited for them than that
of telegraph operator.

Mr. Scott was one of the most delightful superiors that anybody could
have and I soon became warmly attached to him. He was my great man and
all the hero worship that is inherent in youth I showered upon him. I
soon began placing him in imagination in the presidency of the great
Pennsylvania Railroad--a position which he afterwards attained. Under
him I gradually performed duties not strictly belonging to my
department and I can attribute my decided advancement in the service
to one well-remembered incident.

The railway was a single line. Telegraph orders to trains often became
necessary, although it was not then a regular practice to run trains
by telegraph. No one but the superintendent himself was permitted to
give a train order on any part of the Pennsylvania system, or indeed
of any other system, I believe, at that time. It was then a dangerous
expedient to give telegraphic orders, for the whole system of railway
management was still in its infancy, and men had not yet been trained
for it. It was necessary for Mr. Scott to go out night after night to
break-downs or wrecks to superintend the clearing of the line. He was
necessarily absent from the office on many mornings.

One morning I reached the office and found that a serious accident on
the Eastern Division had delayed the express passenger train
westward, and that the passenger train eastward was proceeding with a
flagman in advance at every curve. The freight trains in both
directions were all standing still upon the sidings. Mr. Scott was not
to be found. Finally I could not resist the temptation to plunge in,
take the responsibility, give "train orders," and set matters going.
"Death or Westminster Abbey," flashed across my mind. I knew it was
dismissal, disgrace, perhaps criminal punishment for me if I erred. On
the other hand, I could bring in the wearied freight-train men who had
lain out all night. I could set everything in motion. I knew I could.
I had often done it in wiring Mr. Scott's orders. I knew just what to
do, and so I began. I gave the orders in his name, started every
train, sat at the instrument watching every tick, carried the trains
along from station to station, took extra precautions, and had
everything running smoothly when Mr. Scott at last reached the office.
He had heard of the delays. His first words were:

"Well! How are matters?"

He came to my side quickly, grasped his pencil and began to write his
orders. I had then to speak, and timidly said:

"Mr. Scott, I could not find you anywhere and I gave these orders in
your name early this morning."

"Are they going all right? Where is the Eastern Express?"

I showed him the messages and gave him the position of every train on
the line--freights, ballast trains, everything--showed him the answers
of the various conductors, the latest reports at the stations where
the various trains had passed. All was right. He looked in my face for
a second. I scarcely dared look in his. I did not know what was going
to happen. He did not say one word, but again looked carefully over
all that had taken place. Still he said nothing. After a little he
moved away from my desk to his own, and that was the end of it. He was
afraid to approve what I had done, yet he had not censured me. If it
came out all right, it was all right; if it came out all wrong, the
responsibility was mine. So it stood, but I noticed that he came in
very regularly and in good time for some mornings after that.

Of course I never spoke to any one about it. None of the trainmen knew
that Mr. Scott had not personally given the orders. I had almost made
up my mind that if the like occurred again, I would not repeat my
proceeding of that morning unless I was authorized to do so. I was
feeling rather distressed about what I had done until I heard from Mr.
Franciscus, who was then in charge of the freighting department at
Pittsburgh, that Mr. Scott, the evening after the memorable morning,
had said to him:

"Do you know what that little white-haired Scotch devil of mine did?"

"No."

"I'm blamed if he didn't run every train on the division in my name
without the slightest authority."

"And did he do it all right?" asked Franciscus.

"Oh, yes, all right."

This satisfied me. Of course I had my cue for the next occasion, and
went boldly in. From that date it was very seldom that Mr. Scott gave
a train order.

[Illustration: THOMAS A. SCOTT]

[Illustration: JOHN EDGAR THOMSON]

The greatest man of all on my horizon at this time was John Edgar
Thomson, president of the Pennsylvania, and for whom our steel-rail
mills were afterward named. He was the most reserved and silent of
men, next to General Grant, that I ever knew, although General
Grant was more voluble when at home with friends. He walked about as
if he saw nobody when he made his periodical visits to Pittsburgh.
This reserve I learned afterwards was purely the result of shyness. I
was surprised when in Mr. Scott's office he came to the telegraph
instrument and greeted me as "Scott's Andy." But I learned afterwards
that he had heard of my train-running exploit. The battle of life is
already half won by the young man who is brought personally in contact
with high officials; and the great aim of every boy should be to do
something beyond the sphere of his duties--something which attracts
the attention of those over him.

Some time after this Mr. Scott wished to travel for a week or two and
asked authority from Mr. Lombaert to leave me in charge of the
division. Pretty bold man he was, for I was then not very far out of
my teens. It was granted. Here was the coveted opportunity of my life.
With the exception of one accident caused by the inexcusable
negligence of a ballast-train crew, everything went well in his
absence. But that this accident should occur was gall and wormwood to
me. Determined to fulfill all the duties of the station I held a
court-martial, examined those concerned, dismissed peremptorily the
chief offender, and suspended two others for their share in the
catastrophe. Mr. Scott after his return of course was advised of the
accident, and proposed to investigate and deal with the matter. I felt
I had gone too far, but having taken the step, I informed him that all
that had been settled. I had investigated the matter and punished the
guilty. Some of these appealed to Mr. Scott for a reopening of the
case, but this I never could have agreed to, had it been pressed. More
by look I think than by word Mr. Scott understood my feelings upon
this delicate point, and acquiesced.

It is probable he was afraid I had been too severe and very likely he
was correct. Some years after this, when I, myself, was superintendent
of the division I always had a soft spot in my heart for the men then
suspended for a time. I had felt qualms of conscience about my action
in this, my first court. A new judge is very apt to stand so straight
as really to lean a little backward. Only experience teaches the
supreme force of gentleness. Light but certain punishment, when
necessary, is most effective. Severe punishments are not needed and a
judicious pardon, for the first offense at least, is often best of
all.

As the half-dozen young men who constituted our inner circle grew in
knowledge, it was inevitable that the mysteries of life and death, the
here and the hereafter, should cross our path and have to be grappled
with. We had all been reared by good, honest, self-respecting parents,
members of one or another of the religious sects. Through the
influence of Mrs. McMillan, wife of one of the leading Presbyterian
ministers of Pittsburgh, we were drawn into the social circle of her
husband's church. [As I read this on the moors, July 16, 1912, I have
before me a note from Mrs. McMillan from London in her eightieth year.
Two of her daughters were married in London last week to university
professors, one remains in Britain, the other has accepted an
appointment in Boston. Eminent men both. So draws our English-speaking
race together.] Mr. McMillan was a good strict Calvinist of the old
school, his charming wife a born leader of the young. We were all more
at home with her and enjoyed ourselves more at her home gatherings
than elsewhere. This led to some of us occasionally attending her
church.

A sermon of the strongest kind upon predestination which Miller heard
there brought the subject of theology upon us and it would not down.
Mr. Miller's people were strong Methodists, and Tom had known little
of dogmas. This doctrine of predestination, including infant
damnation--some born to glory and others to the opposite--appalled
him. To my astonishment I learned that, going to Mr. McMillan after
the sermon to talk over the matter, Tom had blurted out at the finish,

"Mr. McMillan, if your idea were correct, your God would be a perfect
devil," and left the astonished minister to himself.

This formed the subject of our Sunday afternoon conferences for many a
week. Was that true or not, and what was to be the consequence of
Tom's declaration? Should we no longer be welcome guests of Mrs.
McMillan? We could have spared the minister, perhaps, but none of us
relished the idea of banishment from his wife's delightful reunions.
There was one point clear. Carlyle's struggles over these matters had
impressed us and we could follow him in his resolve: "If it be
incredible, in God's name let it be discredited." It was only the
truth that could make us free, and the truth, the whole truth, we
should pursue.

Once introduced, of course, the subject remained with us, and one
after the other the dogmas were voted down as the mistaken ideas of
men of a less enlightened age. I forget who first started us with a
second axiom. It was one we often dwelt upon: "A forgiving God would
be the noblest work of man." We accepted as proven that each stage of
civilization creates its own God, and that as man ascends and becomes
better his conception of the Unknown likewise improves. Thereafter we
all became less theological, but I am sure more truly religious. The
crisis passed. Happily we were not excluded from Mrs. McMillan's
society. It was a notable day, however, when we resolved to stand by
Miller's statement, even if it involved banishment and worse. We young
men were getting to be pretty wild boys about theology, although more
truly reverent about religion.

The first great loss to our circle came when John Phipps was killed by
a fall from a horse. This struck home to all of us, yet I remember I
could then say to myself: "John has, as it were, just gone home to
England where he was born. We are all to follow him soon and live
forever together." I had then no doubts. It was not a hope I was
pressing to my heart, but a certainty. Happy those who in their agony
have such a refuge. We should all take Plato's advice and never give
up everlasting hope, "alluring ourselves as with enchantments, for the
hope is noble and the reward is great." Quite right. It would be no
greater miracle that brought us into another world to live forever
with our dearest than that which has brought us into this one to live
a lifetime with them. Both are equally incomprehensible to finite
beings. Let us therefore comfort ourselves with everlasting hope, "as
with enchantments," as Plato recommends, never forgetting, however,
that we all have our duties here and that the kingdom of heaven is
within us. It also passed into an axiom with us that he who proclaims
there is no hereafter is as foolish as he who proclaims there is,
since neither can know, though all may and should hope. Meanwhile
"Home our heaven" instead of "Heaven our home" was our motto.

During these years of which I have been writing, the family fortunes
had been steadily improving. My thirty-five dollars a month had grown
to forty, an unsolicited advance having been made by Mr. Scott. It was
part of my duty to pay the men every month.[19] We used checks upon
the bank and I drew my salary invariably in two twenty-dollar gold
pieces. They seemed to me the prettiest works of art in the world. It
was decided in family council that we could venture to buy the lot and
the two small frame houses upon it, in one of which we had lived, and
the other, a four-roomed house, which till then had been occupied by
my Uncle and Aunt Hogan, who had removed elsewhere. It was through the
aid of my dear Aunt Aitken that we had been placed in the small house
above the weaver's shop, and it was now our turn to be able to ask her
to return to the house that formerly had been her own. In the same way
after we had occupied the four-roomed house, Uncle Hogan having passed
away, we were able to restore Aunt Hogan to her old home when we
removed to Altoona. One hundred dollars cash was paid upon purchase,
and the total price, as I remember, was seven hundred dollars. The
struggle then was to make up the semi-annual payments of interest and
as great an amount of the principal as we could save. It was not long
before the debt was cleared off and we were property-holders, but
before that was accomplished, the first sad break occurred in our
family, in my father's death, October 2, 1855. Fortunately for the
three remaining members life's duties were pressing. Sorrow and duty
contended and we had to work. The expenses connected with his illness
had to be saved and paid and we had not up to this time much store in
reserve.

[Footnote 19: "I remember well when I used to write out the monthly
pay-roll and came to Mr. Scott's name for $125. I wondered what he did
with it all. I was then getting thirty-five." (Andrew Carnegie in
speech at Reunion of U.S. Military Telegraph Corps, March 28, 1907.)]

And here comes in one of the sweet incidents of our early life in
America. The principal member of our small Swedenborgian Society was
Mr. David McCandless. He had taken some notice of my father and
mother, but beyond a few passing words at church on Sundays, I do not
remember that they had ever been brought in close contact. He knew
Aunt Aitken well, however, and now sent for her to say that if my
mother required any money assistance at this sad period he would be
very pleased to advance whatever was necessary. He had heard much of
my heroic mother and that was sufficient.

One gets so many kind offers of assistance when assistance is no
longer necessary, or when one is in a position which would probably
enable him to repay a favor, that it is delightful to record an act of
pure and disinterested benevolence. Here was a poor Scottish woman
bereft of her husband, with her eldest son just getting a start and a
second in his early teens, whose misfortunes appealed to this man, and
who in the most delicate manner sought to mitigate them. Although my
mother was able to decline the proffered aid, it is needless to say
that Mr. McCandless obtained a place in our hearts sacred to himself.
I am a firm believer in the doctrine that people deserving necessary
assistance at critical periods in their career usually receive it.
There are many splendid natures in the world--men and women who are
not only willing, but anxious to stretch forth a helping hand to those
they know to be worthy. As a rule, those who show willingness to help
themselves need not fear about obtaining the help of others.

Father's death threw upon me the management of affairs to a greater
extent than ever. Mother kept on the binding of shoes; Tom went
steadily to the public school; and I continued with Mr. Scott in the
service of the railroad company. Just at this time Fortunatus knocked
at our door. Mr. Scott asked me if I had five hundred dollars. If so,
he said he wished to make an investment for me. Five hundred cents was
much nearer my capital. I certainly had not fifty dollars saved for
investment, but I was not going to miss the chance of becoming
financially connected with my leader and great man. So I said boldly I
thought I could manage that sum. He then told me that there were ten
shares of Adams Express stock that he could buy, which had belonged to
a station agent, Mr. Reynolds, of Wilkinsburg. Of course this was
reported to the head of the family that evening, and she was not long
in suggesting what might be done. When did she ever fail? We had then
paid five hundred dollars upon the house, and in some way she thought
this might be pledged as security for a loan.

My mother took the steamer the next morning for East Liverpool,
arriving at night, and through her brother there the money was
secured. He was a justice of the peace, a well-known resident of that
then small town, and had numerous sums in hand from farmers for
investment. Our house was mortgaged and mother brought back the five
hundred dollars which I handed over to Mr. Scott, who soon obtained
for me the coveted ten shares in return. There was, unexpectedly, an
additional hundred dollars to pay as a premium, but Mr. Scott kindly
said I could pay that when convenient, and this of course was an easy
matter to do.

This was my first investment. In those good old days monthly
dividends were more plentiful than now and Adams Express paid a
monthly dividend. One morning a white envelope was lying upon my desk,
addressed in a big John Hancock hand, to "Andrew Carnegie, Esquire."
"Esquire" tickled the boys and me inordinately. At one corner was seen
the round stamp of Adams Express Company. I opened the envelope. All
it contained was a check for ten dollars upon the Gold Exchange Bank
of New York. I shall remember that check as long as I live, and that
John Hancock signature of "J.C. Babcock, Cashier." It gave me the
first penny of revenue from capital--something that I had not worked
for with the sweat of my brow. "Eureka!" I cried. "Here's the goose
that lays the golden eggs."

It was the custom of our party to spend Sunday afternoons in the
woods. I kept the first check and showed it as we sat under the trees
in a favorite grove we had found near Wood's Run. The effect produced
upon my companions was overwhelming. None of them had imagined such an
investment possible. We resolved to save and to watch for the next
opportunity for investment in which all of us should share, and for
years afterward we divided our trifling investments and worked
together almost as partners.

Up to this time my circle of acquaintances had not enlarged much. Mrs.
Franciscus, wife of our freight agent, was very kind and on several
occasions asked me to her house in Pittsburgh. She often spoke of the
first time I rang the bell of the house in Third Street to deliver a
message from Mr. Scott. She asked me to come in; I bashfully declined
and it required coaxing upon her part to overcome my shyness. She was
never able for years to induce me to partake of a meal in her house. I
had great timidity about going into other people's houses, until late
in life; but Mr. Scott would occasionally insist upon my going to his
hotel and taking a meal with him, and these were great occasions for
me. Mr. Franciscus's was the first considerable house, with the
exception of Mr. Lombaert's at Altoona, I had ever entered, as far as
I recollect. Every house was fashionable in my eyes that was upon any
one of the principal streets, provided it had a hall entrance.

I had never spent a night in a strange house in my life until Mr.
Stokes of Greensburg, chief counsel of the Pennsylvania Railroad,
invited me to his beautiful home in the country to pass a Sunday. It
was an odd thing for Mr. Stokes to do, for I could little interest a
brilliant and educated man like him. The reason for my receiving such
an honor was a communication I had written for the "Pittsburgh
Journal." Even in my teens I was a scribbler for the press. To be an
editor was one of my ambitions. Horace Greeley and the "Tribune" was
my ideal of human triumph. Strange that there should have come a day
when I could have bought the "Tribune"; but by that time the pearl had
lost its luster. Our air castles are often within our grasp late in
life, but then they charm not.

The subject of my article was upon the attitude of the city toward the
Pennsylvania Railroad Company. It was signed anonymously and I was
surprised to find it got a prominent place in the columns of the
"Journal," then owned and edited by Robert M. Riddle. I, as operator,
received a telegram addressed to Mr. Scott and signed by Mr. Stokes,
asking him to ascertain from Mr. Riddle who the author of that
communication was. I knew that Mr. Riddle could not tell the author,
because he did not know him; but at the same time I was afraid that if
Mr. Scott called upon him he would hand him the manuscript, which Mr.
Scott would certainly recognize at a glance. I therefore made a clean
breast of it to Mr. Scott and told him I was the author. He seemed
incredulous. He said he had read it that morning and wondered who had
written it. His incredulous look did not pass me unnoticed. The pen
was getting to be a weapon with me. Mr. Stokes's invitation to spend
Sunday with him followed soon after, and the visit is one of the
bright spots in my life. Henceforth we were great friends.

The grandeur of Mr. Stokes's home impressed me, but the one feature of
it that eclipsed all else was a marble mantel in his library. In the
center of the arch, carved in the marble, was an open book with this
inscription:

    "He that cannot reason is a fool,
    He that will not a bigot,
    He that dare not a slave."

These noble words thrilled me. I said to myself, "Some day, some day,
I'll have a library" (that was a look ahead) "and these words shall
grace the mantel as here." And so they do in New York and Skibo
to-day.

Another Sunday which I spent at his home after an interval of several
years was also noteworthy. I had then become the superintendent of the
Pittsburgh Division of the Pennsylvania Railroad. The South had
seceded. I was all aflame for the flag. Mr. Stokes, being a leading
Democrat, argued against the right of the North to use force for the
preservation of the Union. He gave vent to sentiments which caused me
to lose my self-control, and I exclaimed:

"Mr. Stokes, we shall be hanging men like you in less than six weeks."

I hear his laugh as I write, and his voice calling to his wife in the
adjoining room:

"Nancy, Nancy, listen to this young Scotch devil. He says they will be
hanging men like me in less than six weeks."

Strange things happened in those days. A short time after, that same
Mr. Stokes was applying to me in Washington to help him to a major's
commission in the volunteer forces. I was then in the Secretary of
War's office, helping to manage the military railroads and telegraphs
for the Government. This appointment he secured and ever after was
Major Stokes, so that the man who doubted the right of the North to
fight for the Union had himself drawn sword in the good cause. Men at
first argued and theorized about Constitutional rights. It made all
the difference in the world when the flag was fired upon. In a moment
everything was ablaze--paper constitutions included. The Union and Old
Glory! That was all the people cared for, but that was enough. The
Constitution was intended to insure one flag, and as Colonel Ingersoll
proclaimed: "There was not air enough on the American continent to
float two."




CHAPTER VII

SUPERINTENDENT OF THE PENNSYLVANIA


Mr. Scott was promoted to be the general superintendent of the
Pennsylvania Railroad in 1856, taking Mr. Lombaert's place; and he
took me, then in my twenty-third year, with him to Altoona. This
breaking-up of associations in Pittsburgh was a sore trial, but
nothing could be allowed to interfere for a moment with my business
career. My mother was satisfied upon this point, great as the strain
was upon her. Besides, "follow my leader" was due to so true a friend
as Mr. Scott had been.

His promotion to the superintendency gave rise to some jealousy; and
besides that, he was confronted with a strike at the very beginning of
his appointment. He had lost his wife in Pittsburgh a short time
before and had his lonely hours. He was a stranger in Altoona, his new
headquarters, and there was none but myself seemingly of whom he could
make a companion. We lived for many weeks at the railway hotel
together before he took up housekeeping and brought his children from
Pittsburgh, and at his desire I occupied the same large bedroom with
him. He seemed anxious always to have me near him.

The strike became more and more threatening. I remember being wakened
one night and told that the freight-train men had left their trains at
Mifflin; that the line was blocked on this account and all traffic
stopped. Mr. Scott was then sleeping soundly. It seemed to me a pity
to disturb him, knowing how overworked and overanxious he was; but he
awoke and I suggested that I should go up and attend to the matter.
He seemed to murmur assent, not being more than half awake. So I went
to the office and in his name argued the question with the men and
promised them a hearing next day at Altoona. I succeeded in getting
them to resume their duties and to start the traffic.

Not only were the trainmen in a rebellious mood, but the men in the
shops were rapidly organizing to join with the disaffected. This I
learned in a curious manner. One night, as I was walking home in the
dark, I became aware that a man was following me. By and by he came up
to me and said:

"I must not be seen with you, but you did me a favor once and I then
resolved if ever I could serve you I would do it. I called at the
office in Pittsburgh and asked for work as a blacksmith. You said
there was no work then at Pittsburgh, but perhaps employment could be
had at Altoona, and if I would wait a few minutes you would ask by
telegraph. You took the trouble to do so, examined my recommendations,
and gave me a pass and sent me here. I have a splendid job. My wife
and family are here and I was never so well situated in my life. And
now I want to tell you something for your good."

I listened and he went on to say that a paper was being rapidly signed
by the shopmen, pledging themselves to strike on Monday next. There
was no time to be lost. I told Mr. Scott in the morning and he at once
had printed notices posted in the shops that all men who had signed
the paper, pledging themselves to strike, were dismissed and they
should call at the office to be paid. A list of the names of the
signers had come into our possession in the meantime, and this fact
was announced. Consternation followed and the threatened strike was
broken.

I have had many incidents, such as that of the blacksmith, in my life.
Slight attentions or a kind word to the humble often bring back reward
as great as it is unlooked for. No kind action is ever lost. Even to
this day I occasionally meet men whom I had forgotten, who recall some
trifling attention I have been able to pay them, especially when in
charge at Washington of government railways and telegraphs during the
Civil War, when I could pass people within the lines--a father helped
to reach a wounded or sick son at the front, or enabled to bring home
his remains, or some similar service. I am indebted to these trifles
for some of the happiest attentions and the most pleasing incidents of
my life. And there is this about such actions: they are disinterested,
and the reward is sweet in proportion to the humbleness of the
individual whom you have obliged. It counts many times more to do a
kindness to a poor working-man than to a millionaire, who may be able
some day to repay the favor. How true Wordsworth's lines:

    "That best portion of a good man's life--
    His little, nameless, unremembered acts
    Of kindness and of love."

The chief happening, judged by its consequences, of the two years I
spent with Mr. Scott at Altoona, arose from my being the principal
witness in a suit against the company, which was being tried at
Greensburg by the brilliant Major Stokes, my first host. It was feared
that I was about to be subpoenaed by the plaintiff, and the Major,
wishing a postponement of the case, asked Mr. Scott to send me out of
the State as rapidly as possible. This was a happy change for me, as I
was enabled to visit my two bosom companions, Miller and Wilson, then
in the railway service at Crestline, Ohio. On my way thither, while
sitting on the end seat of the rear car watching the line, a
farmer-looking man approached me. He carried a small green bag in his
hand. He said the brakeman had informed him I was connected with the
Pennsylvania Railroad. He wished to show me the model of a car which
he had invented for night traveling. He took a small model out of the
bag, which showed a section of a sleeping-car.

This was the celebrated T.T. Woodruff, the inventor of that now
indispensable adjunct of civilization--the sleeping-car. Its
importance flashed upon me. I asked him if he would come to Altoona if
I sent for him, and I promised to lay the matter before Mr. Scott at
once upon my return. I could not get that sleeping-car idea out of my
mind, and was most anxious to return to Altoona that I might press my
views upon Mr. Scott. When I did so, he thought I was taking time by
the forelock, but was quite receptive and said I might telegraph for
the patentee. He came and contracted to place two of his cars upon the
line as soon as they could be built. After this Mr. Woodruff, greatly
to my surprise, asked me if I would not join him in the new enterprise
and offered me an eighth interest in the venture.

I promptly accepted his offer, trusting to be able to make payments
somehow or other. The two cars were to be paid for by monthly
installments after delivery. When the time came for making the first
payment, my portion was two hundred and seventeen and a half dollars.
I boldly decided to apply to the local banker, Mr. Lloyd, for a loan
of that sum. I explained the matter to him, and I remember that he put
his great arm (he was six feet three or four) around me, saying:

"Why, of course I will lend it. You are all right, Andy."

And here I made my first note, and actually got a banker to take it. A
proud moment that in a young man's career! The sleeping-cars were a
great success and their monthly receipts paid the monthly
installments. The first considerable sum I made was from this source.
[To-day, July 19, 1909, as I re-read this, how glad I am that I have
recently heard from Mr. Lloyd's married daughter telling me of her
father's deep affection for me, thus making me very happy, indeed.]

One important change in our life at Altoona, after my mother and
brother arrived, was that, instead of continuing to live exclusively
by ourselves, it was considered necessary that we should have a
servant. It was with the greatest reluctance my mother could be
brought to admit a stranger into the family circle. She had been
everything and had done everything for her two boys. This was her
life, and she resented with all a strong woman's jealousy the
introduction of a stranger who was to be permitted to do anything
whatever in the home. She had cooked and served her boys, washed their
clothes and mended them, made their beds, cleaned their home. Who dare
rob her of those motherly privileges! But nevertheless we could not
escape the inevitable servant girl. One came, and others followed, and
with these came also the destruction of much of that genuine family
happiness which flows from exclusiveness. Being served by others is a
poor substitute for a mother's labor of love. The ostentatious meal
prepared by a strange cook whom one seldom sees, and served by hands
paid for the task, lacks the sweetness of that which a mother's hands
lay before you as the expression and proof of her devotion.

Among the manifold blessings I have to be thankful for is that neither
nurse nor governess was my companion in infancy. No wonder the
children of the poor are distinguished for the warmest affection and
the closest adherence to family ties and are characterized by a filial
regard far stronger than that of those who are mistakenly called more
fortunate in life. They have passed the impressionable years of
childhood and youth in constant loving contact with father and mother,
to each they are all in all, no third person coming between. The child
that has in his father a teacher, companion, and counselor, and whose
mother is to him a nurse, seamstress, governess, teacher, companion,
heroine, and saint all in one, has a heritage to which the child of
wealth remains a stranger.

There comes a time, although the fond mother cannot see it, when a
grown son has to put his arms around his saint and kissing her
tenderly try to explain to her that it would be much better were she
to let him help her in some ways; that, being out in the world among
men and dealing with affairs, he sometimes sees changes which it would
be desirable to make; that the mode of life delightful for young boys
should be changed in some respects and the house made suitable for
their friends to enter. Especially should the slaving mother live the
life of ease hereafter, reading and visiting more and entertaining
dear friends--in short, rising to her proper and deserved position as
Her Ladyship.

Of course the change was very hard upon my mother, but she finally
recognized the necessity for it, probably realized for the first time
that her eldest son was getting on. "Dear Mother," I pleaded, my arms
still around her, "you have done everything for and have been
everything to Tom and me, and now do let me do something for you; let
us be partners and let us always think what is best for each other.
The time has come for you to play the lady and some of these days you
are to ride in your carriage; meanwhile do get that girl in to help
you. Tom and I would like this."

The victory was won, and my mother began to go out with us and visit
her neighbors. She had not to learn self-possession nor good manners,
these were innate; and as for education, knowledge, rare good sense,
and kindliness, seldom was she to meet her equal. I wrote "never"
instead of "seldom" and then struck it out. Nevertheless my private
opinion is reserved.

Life at Altoona was made more agreeable for me through Mr. Scott's
niece, Miss Rebecca Stewart, who kept house for him. She played the
part of elder sister to me to perfection, especially when Mr. Scott
was called to Philadelphia or elsewhere. We were much together, often
driving in the afternoons through the woods. The intimacy did not
cease for many years, and re-reading some of her letters in 1906 I
realized more than ever my indebtedness to her. She was not much
beyond my own age, but always seemed a great deal older. Certainly she
was more mature and quite capable of playing the elder sister's part.
It was to her I looked up in those days as the perfect lady. Sorry am
I our paths parted so widely in later years. Her daughter married the
Earl of Sussex and her home in late years has been abroad. [July 19,
1909, Mrs. Carnegie and I found my elder-sister friend April last, now
in widowhood, in Paris, her sister and also her daughter all well and
happy. A great pleasure, indeed. There are no substitutes for the true
friends of youth.]

Mr. Scott remained at Altoona for about three years when deserved
promotion came to him. In 1859 he was made vice-president of the
company, with his office in Philadelphia. What was to become of me was
a serious question. Would he take me with him or must I remain at
Altoona with the new official? The thought was to me unbearable. To
part with Mr. Scott was hard enough; to serve a new official in his
place I did not believe possible. The sun rose and set upon his head
so far as I was concerned. The thought of my promotion, except through
him, never entered my mind.

He returned from his interview with the president at Philadelphia and
asked me to come into the private room in his house which communicated
with the office. He told me it had been settled that he should remove
to Philadelphia. Mr. Enoch Lewis, the division superintendent, was to
be his successor. I listened with great interest as he approached the
inevitable disclosure as to what he was going to do with me. He said
finally:

"Now about yourself. Do you think you could manage the Pittsburgh
Division?"

I was at an age when I thought I could manage anything. I knew nothing
that I would not attempt, but it had never occurred to me that anybody
else, much less Mr. Scott, would entertain the idea that I was as yet
fit to do anything of the kind proposed. I was only twenty-four years
old, but my model then was Lord John Russell, of whom it was said he
would take the command of the Channel Fleet to-morrow. So would
Wallace or Bruce. I told Mr. Scott I thought I could.

"Well," he said, "Mr. Potts" (who was then superintendent of the
Pittsburgh Division) "is to be promoted to the transportation
department in Philadelphia and I recommended you to the president as
his successor. He agreed to give you a trial. What salary do you think
you should have?"

"Salary," I said, quite offended; "what do I care for salary? I do not
want the salary; I want the position. It is glory enough to go back
to the Pittsburgh Division in your former place. You can make my
salary just what you please and you need not give me any more than
what I am getting now."

That was sixty-five dollars a month.

"You know," he said, "I received fifteen hundred dollars a year when I
was there; and Mr. Potts is receiving eighteen hundred. I think it
would be right to start you at fifteen hundred dollars, and after a
while if you succeed you will get the eighteen hundred. Would that be
satisfactory?"

"Oh, please," I said, "don't speak to me of money!"

It was not a case of mere hire and salary, and then and there my
promotion was sealed. I was to have a department to myself, and
instead of signing "T.A.S." orders between Pittsburgh and Altoona
would now be signed "A.C." That was glory enough for me.

The order appointing me superintendent of the Pittsburgh Division was
issued December 1, 1859. Preparations for removing the family were
made at once. The change was hailed with joy, for although our
residence in Altoona had many advantages, especially as we had a large
house with some ground about it in a pleasant part of the suburbs and
therefore many of the pleasures of country life, all these did not
weigh as a feather in the scale as against the return to old friends
and associations in dirty, smoky Pittsburgh. My brother Tom had
learned telegraphy during his residence in Altoona and he returned
with me and became my secretary.

The winter following my appointment was one of the most severe ever
known. The line was poorly constructed, the equipment inefficient and
totally inadequate for the business that was crowding upon it. The
rails were laid upon huge blocks of stone, cast-iron chairs for
holding the rails were used, and I have known as many as forty-seven
of these to break in one night. No wonder the wrecks were frequent.
The superintendent of a division in those days was expected to run
trains by telegraph at night, to go out and remove all wrecks, and
indeed to do everything. At one time for eight days I was constantly
upon the line, day and night, at one wreck or obstruction after
another. I was probably the most inconsiderate superintendent that
ever was entrusted with the management of a great property, for, never
knowing fatigue myself, being kept up by a sense of responsibility
probably, I overworked the men and was not careful enough in
considering the limits of human endurance. I have always been able to
sleep at any time. Snatches of half an hour at intervals during the
night in a dirty freight car were sufficient.

The Civil War brought such extraordinary demands on the Pennsylvania
line that I was at last compelled to organize a night force; but it
was with difficulty I obtained the consent of my superiors to entrust
the charge of the line at night to a train dispatcher. Indeed, I never
did get their unequivocal authority to do so, but upon my own
responsibility I appointed perhaps the first night train dispatcher
that ever acted in America--at least he was the first upon the
Pennsylvania system.

Upon our return to Pittsburgh in 1860 we rented a house in Hancock
Street, now Eighth Street, and resided there for a year or more. Any
accurate description of Pittsburgh at that time would be set down as a
piece of the grossest exaggeration. The smoke permeated and penetrated
everything. If you placed your hand on the balustrade of the stair it
came away black; if you washed face and hands they were as dirty as
ever in an hour. The soot gathered in the hair and irritated the skin,
and for a time after our return from the mountain atmosphere of
Altoona, life was more or less miserable. We soon began to consider
how we could get to the country, and fortunately at that time Mr. D.A.
Stewart, then freight agent for the company, directed our attention to
a house adjoining his residence at Homewood. We moved there at once
and the telegraph was brought in, which enabled me to operate the
division from the house when necessary.

Here a new life was opened to us. There were country lanes and gardens
in abundance. Residences had from five to twenty acres of land about
them. The Homewood Estate was made up of many hundreds of acres, with
beautiful woods and glens and a running brook. We, too, had a garden
and a considerable extent of ground around our house. The happiest
years of my mother's life were spent here among her flowers and
chickens and the surroundings of country life. Her love of flowers was
a passion. She was scarcely ever able to gather a flower. Indeed I
remember she once reproached me for pulling up a weed, saying "it was
something green." I have inherited this peculiarity and have often
walked from the house to the gate intending to pull a flower for my
button-hole and then left for town unable to find one I could destroy.

With this change to the country came a whole host of new
acquaintances. Many of the wealthy families of the district had their
residences in this delightful suburb. It was, so to speak, the
aristocratic quarter. To the entertainments at these great houses the
young superintendent was invited. The young people were musical and we
had musical evenings a plenty. I heard subjects discussed which I had
never known before, and I made it a rule when I heard these to learn
something about them at once. I was pleased every day to feel that I
was learning something new.

It was here that I first met the Vandevort brothers, Benjamin and
John. The latter was my traveling-companion on various trips which I
took later in life. "Dear Vandy" appears as my chum in "Round the
World." Our neighbors, Mr. and Mrs. Stewart, became more and more dear
to us, and the acquaintance we had before ripened into lasting
friendship. One of my pleasures is that Mr. Stewart subsequently
embarked in business with us and became a partner, as "Vandy" did
also. Greatest of all the benefits of our new home, however, was
making the acquaintance of the leading family of Western Pennsylvania,
that of the Honorable Judge Wilkins. The Judge was then approaching
his eightieth year, tall, slender, and handsome, in full possession of
all his faculties, with a courtly grace of manner, and the most
wonderful store of knowledge and reminiscence of any man I had yet
been privileged to meet. His wife, the daughter of George W. Dallas,
Vice-President of the United States, has ever been my type of gracious
womanhood in age--the most beautiful, most charming venerable old lady
I ever knew or saw. Her daughter, Miss Wilkins, with her sister, Mrs.
Saunders, and her children resided in the stately mansion at Homewood,
which was to the surrounding district what the baronial hall in
Britain is or should be to its district--the center of all that was
cultured, refined, and elevating.

To me it was especially pleasing that I seemed to be a welcome guest
there. Musical parties, charades, and theatricals in which Miss
Wilkins took the leading parts furnished me with another means of
self-improvement. The Judge himself was the first man of historical
note whom I had ever known. I shall never forget the impression it
made upon me when in the course of conversation, wishing to illustrate
a remark, he said: "President Jackson once said to me," or, "I told
the Duke of Wellington so and so." The Judge in his earlier life
(1834) had been Minister to Russia under Jackson, and in the same easy
way spoke of his interview with the Czar. It seemed to me that I was
touching history itself. The house was a new atmosphere, and my
intercourse with the family was a powerful stimulant to the desire for
improvement of my own mind and manners.

The only subject upon which there was always a decided, though silent,
antagonism between the Wilkins family and myself was politics. I was
an ardent Free-Soiler in days when to be an abolitionist was somewhat
akin to being a republican in Britain. The Wilkinses were strong
Democrats with leanings toward the South, being closely connected with
leading Southern families. On one occasion at Homewood, on entering
the drawing-room, I found the family excitedly conversing about a
terrible incident that had recently occurred.

"What do you think!" said Mrs. Wilkins to me; "Dallas" (her grandson)
"writes me that he has been compelled by the commandant of West Point
to sit next a negro! Did you ever hear the like of that? Is it not
disgraceful? Negroes admitted to West Point!"

"Oh!" I said, "Mrs. Wilkins, there is something even worse than that.
I understand that some of them have been admitted to heaven!"

There was a silence that could be felt. Then dear Mrs. Wilkins said
gravely:

"That is a different matter, Mr. Carnegie."

By far the most precious gift ever received by me up to that time came
about in this manner. Dear Mrs. Wilkins began knitting an afghan, and
during the work many were the inquiries as to whom it was for. No,
the dear queenly old lady would not tell; she kept her secret all the
long months until, Christmas drawing near, the gift finished and
carefully wrapped up, and her card with a few loving words enclosed,
she instructed her daughter to address it to me. It was duly received
in New York. Such a tribute from such a lady! Well, that afghan,
though often shown to dear friends, has not been much used. It is
sacred to me and remains among my precious possessions.

I had been so fortunate as to meet Leila Addison while living in
Pittsburgh, the talented daughter of Dr. Addison, who had died a short
time before. I soon became acquainted with the family and record with
grateful feelings the immense advantage which that acquaintance also
brought to me. Here was another friendship formed with people who had
all the advantages of the higher education. Carlyle had been Mrs.
Addison's tutor for a time, for she was an Edinburgh lady. Her
daughters had been educated abroad and spoke French, Spanish, and
Italian as fluently as English. It was through intercourse with this
family that I first realized the indescribable yet immeasurable gulf
that separates the highly educated from people like myself. But "the
wee drap o' Scotch bluid atween us" proved its potency as usual.

Miss Addison became an ideal friend because she undertook to improve
the rough diamond, if it were indeed a diamond at all. She was my best
friend, because my severest critic. I began to pay strict attention to
my language, and to the English classics, which I now read with great
avidity. I began also to notice how much better it was to be gentle in
tone and manner, polite and courteous to all--in short, better
behaved. Up to this time I had been, perhaps, careless in dress and
rather affected it. Great heavy boots, loose collar, and general
roughness of attire were then peculiar to the West and in our circle
considered manly. Anything that could be labeled foppish was looked
upon with contempt. I remember the first gentleman I ever saw in the
service of the railway company who wore kid gloves. He was the object
of derision among us who aspired to be manly men. I was a great deal
the better in all these respects after we moved to Homewood, owing to
the Addisons.




CHAPTER VIII

CIVIL WAR PERIOD


In 1861 the Civil War broke out and I was at once summoned to
Washington by Mr. Scott, who had been appointed Assistant Secretary of
War in charge of the Transportation Department. I was to act as his
assistant in charge of the military railroads and telegraphs of the
Government and to organize a force of railway men. It was one of the
most important departments of all at the beginning of the war.

The first regiments of Union troops passing through Baltimore had been
attacked, and the railway line cut between Baltimore and Annapolis
Junction, destroying communication with Washington. It was therefore
necessary for me, with my corps of assistants, to take train at
Philadelphia for Annapolis, a point from which a branch line extended
to the Junction, joining the main line to Washington. Our first duty
was to repair this branch and make it passable for heavy trains, a
work of some days. General Butler and several regiments of troops
arrived a few days after us, and we were able to transport his whole
brigade to Washington.

I took my place upon the first engine which started for the Capital,
and proceeded very cautiously. Some distance from Washington I noticed
that the telegraph wires had been pinned to the ground by wooden
stakes. I stopped the engine and ran forward to release them, but I
did not notice that the wires had been pulled to one side before
staking. When released, in their spring upwards, they struck me in the
face, knocked me over, and cut a gash in my cheek which bled
profusely. In this condition I entered the city of Washington with the
first troops, so that with the exception of one or two soldiers,
wounded a few days previously in passing through the streets of
Baltimore, I can justly claim that I "shed my blood for my country"
among the first of its defenders. I gloried in being useful to the
land that had done so much for me, and worked, I can truly say, night
and day, to open communication to the South.

I soon removed my headquarters to Alexandria,[20] Virginia, and was
stationed there when the unfortunate battle of Bull Run was fought. We
could not believe the reports that came to us, but it soon became
evident that we must rush every engine and car to the front to bring
back our defeated forces. The closest point then was Burke Station. I
went out there and loaded up train after train of the poor wounded
volunteers. The rebels were reported to be close upon us and we were
finally compelled to close Burke Station, the operator and myself
leaving on the last train for Alexandria where the effect of panic was
evident upon every side. Some of our railway men were missing, but the
number at the mess on the following morning showed that, compared with
other branches of the service, we had cause for congratulation. A few
conductors and engineers had obtained boats and crossed the Potomac,
but the great body of the men remained, although the roar of the guns
of the pursuing enemy was supposed to be heard in every sound during
the night. Of our telegraphers not one was missing the next morning.

[Footnote 20: "When Carnegie reached Washington his first task was to
establish a ferry to Alexandria and to extend the Baltimore and Ohio
Railroad track from the old depot in Washington, along Maryland Avenue
to and across the Potomac, so that locomotives and cars might be
crossed for use in Virginia. Long Bridge, over the Potomac, had to be
rebuilt, and I recall the fact that under the direction of Carnegie
and R.F. Morley the railroad between Washington and Alexandria was
completed in the remarkably short period of seven days. All hands,
from Carnegie down, worked day and night to accomplish the task."
(Bates, _Lincoln in the Telegraph Office_, p. 22. New York, 1907.)]

Soon after this I returned to Washington and made my headquarters in
the War Building with Colonel Scott. As I had charge of the telegraph
department, as well as the railways, this gave me an opportunity of
seeing President Lincoln, Mr. Seward, Secretary Cameron, and others;
and I was occasionally brought in personal contact with these men,
which was to me a source of great interest. Mr. Lincoln would
occasionally come to the office and sit at the desk awaiting replies
to telegrams, or perhaps merely anxious for information.

All the pictures of this extraordinary man are like him. He was so
marked of feature that it was impossible for any one to paint him and
not produce a likeness. He was certainly one of the most homely men I
ever saw when his features were in repose; but when excited or telling
a story, intellect shone through his eyes and illuminated his face to
a degree which I have seldom or never seen in any other. His manners
were perfect because natural; and he had a kind word for everybody,
even the youngest boy in the office. His attentions were not
graduated. They were the same to all, as deferential in talking to the
messenger boy as to Secretary Seward. His charm lay in the total
absence of manner. It was not so much, perhaps, what he said as the
way in which he said it that never failed to win one. I have often
regretted that I did not note down carefully at the time some of his
curious sayings, for he said even common things in an original way. I
never met a great man who so thoroughly made himself one with all men
as Mr. Lincoln. As Secretary Hay so well says, "It is impossible to
imagine any one a valet to Mr. Lincoln; he would have been his
companion." He was the most perfect democrat, revealing in every word
and act the equality of men.

When Mason and Slidell in 1861 were taken from the British ship Trent
there was intense anxiety upon the part of those who, like myself,
knew what the right of asylum on her ships meant to Britain. It was
certain war or else a prompt return of the prisoners. Secretary
Cameron being absent when the Cabinet was summoned to consider the
question, Mr. Scott was invited to attend as Assistant Secretary of
War. I did my best to let him understand that upon this issue Britain
would fight beyond question, and urged that he stand firm for
surrender, especially since it had been the American doctrine that
ships should be immune from search. Mr. Scott, knowing nothing of
foreign affairs, was disposed to hold the captives, but upon his
return from the meeting he told me that Seward had warned the Cabinet
it meant war, just as I had said. Lincoln, too, was at first inclined
to hold the prisoners, but was at last converted to Seward's policy.
The Cabinet, however, had decided to postpone action until the morrow,
when Cameron and other absentees would be present. Mr. Scott was
requested by Seward to meet Cameron on arrival and get him right on
the subject before going to the meeting, for he was expected to be in
no surrendering mood. This was done and all went well next day.

The general confusion which reigned at Washington at this time had to
be seen to be understood. No description can convey my initial
impression of it. The first time I saw General Scott, then
Commander-in-Chief, he was being helped by two men across the pavement
from his office into his carriage. He was an old, decrepit man,
paralyzed not only in body, but in mind; and it was upon this noble
relic of the past that the organization of the forces of the Republic
depended. His chief commissary, General Taylor, was in some degree a
counterpart of Scott. It was our business to arrange with these, and
others scarcely less fit, for the opening of communications and for
the transportation of men and supplies. They were seemingly one and
all martinets who had passed the age of usefulness. Days would elapse
before a decision could be obtained upon matters which required prompt
action. There was scarcely a young active officer at the head of any
important department--at least I cannot recall one. Long years of
peace had fossilized the service.

The same cause had produced like results, I understood, in the Navy
Department, but I was not brought in personal contact with it. The
navy was not important at the beginning; it was the army that counted.
Nothing but defeat was to be looked for until the heads of the various
departments were changed, and this could not be done in a day. The
impatience of the country at the apparent delay in producing an
effective weapon for the great task thrown upon the Government was no
doubt natural, but the wonder to me is that order was so soon evolved
from the chaos which prevailed in every branch of the service.

As far as our operations were concerned we had one great advantage.
Secretary Cameron authorized Mr. Scott (he had been made a Colonel) to
do what he thought necessary without waiting for the slow movements of
the officials under the Secretary of War. Of this authority unsparing
use was made, and the important part played by the railway and
telegraph department of the Government from the very beginning of the
war is to be attributed to the fact that we had the cordial support of
Secretary Cameron. He was then in the possession of all his faculties
and grasped the elements of the problem far better than his generals
and heads of departments. Popular clamor compelled Lincoln to change
him at last, but those who were behind the scenes well knew that if
other departments had been as well managed as was the War Department
under Cameron, all things considered, much of disaster would have been
avoided.

Lochiel, as Cameron liked to be called, was a man of sentiment. In his
ninetieth year he visited us in Scotland and, passing through one of
our glens, sitting on the front seat of our four-in-hand coach, he
reverently took off his hat and bareheaded rode through the glen,
overcome by its grandeur. The conversation turned once upon the
efforts which candidates for office must themselves put forth and the
fallacy that office seeks the man, except in very rare emergencies.
Apropos of this Lochiel told this story about Lincoln's second term:

One day at Cameron's country home near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, he
received a telegram saying that President Lincoln would like to see
him. Accordingly he went to Washington. Lincoln began:

"Cameron, the people about me are telling me that it is my patriotic
duty to become a candidate for a second term, that I am the only man
who can save my country, and so on; and do you know I'm just beginning
to be fool enough to believe them a little. What do you say, and how
could it be managed?"

"Well, Mr. President, twenty-eight years ago President Jackson sent
for me as you have now done and told me just the same story. His
letter reached me in New Orleans and I traveled ten days to reach
Washington. I told President Jackson I thought the best plan would be
to have the Legislature of one of the States pass resolutions
insisting that the pilot should not desert the ship during these
stormy times, and so forth. If one State did this I thought others
would follow. Mr. Jackson concurred and I went to Harrisburg, and had
such a resolution prepared and passed. Other States followed as I
expected and, as you know, he won a second term."

"Well," said Lincoln, "could you do that now?"

"No," said I, "I am too near to you, Mr. President; but if you desire
I might get a friend to attend to it, I think."

"Well," said President Lincoln, "I leave the matter with you."

"I sent for Foster here" (who was his companion on the coach and our
guest) "and asked him to look up the Jackson resolutions. We changed
them a little to meet new conditions and passed them. The like result
followed as in the case of President Jackson. Upon my next visit to
Washington I went in the evening to the President's public reception.
When I entered the crowded and spacious East Room, being like Lincoln
very tall, the President recognized me over the mass of people and
holding up both white-gloved hands which looked like two legs of
mutton, called out: 'Two more in to-day, Cameron, two more.' That is,
two additional States had passed the Jackson-Lincoln resolutions."

Apart from the light this incident throws upon political life, it is
rather remarkable that the same man should have been called upon by
two presidents of the United States, twenty-eight years apart, under
exactly similar circumstances and asked for advice, and that, the same
expedient being employed, both men became candidates and both secured
second terms. As was once explained upon a memorable occasion:
"There's figuring in all them things."

When in Washington I had not met General Grant, because he was in the
West up to the time of my leaving, but on a journey to and from
Washington he stopped at Pittsburgh to make the necessary arrangements
for his removal to the East. I met him on the line upon both occasions
and took him to dine with me in Pittsburgh. There were no dining-cars
then. He was the most ordinary-looking man of high position I had ever
met, and the last that one would select at first glance as a
remarkable man. I remember that Secretary of War Stanton said that
when he visited the armies in the West, General Grant and his staff
entered his car; he looked at them, one after the other, as they
entered and seeing General Grant, said to himself, "Well, I do not
know which is General Grant, but there is one that cannot be." Yet
this was he. [Reading this years after it was written, I laugh. It is
pretty hard on the General, for I have been taken for him more than
once.]

In those days of the war much was talked about "strategy" and the
plans of the various generals. I was amazed at General Grant's freedom
in talking to me about such things. Of course he knew that I had been
in the War Office, and was well known to Secretary Stanton,[21] and
had some knowledge of what was going on; but my surprise can be
imagined when he said to me:

"Well, the President and Stanton want me to go East and take command
there, and I have agreed to do it. I am just going West to make the
necessary arrangements."

I said, "I suspected as much."

"I am going to put Sherman in charge," he said.

"That will surprise the country," I said, "for I think the impression
is that General Thomas should succeed."

"Yes, I know that," he said, "but I know the men and Thomas will be
the first to say that Sherman is the man for the work. There will be
no trouble about that. The fact is the western end is pretty far down,
and the next thing we must do is to push the eastern end down a
little."

[Footnote 21: Mr. Carnegie gave to Stanton's college, Kenyon, $80,000,
and on April 26, 1906, delivered at the college an address on the
great War Secretary. It has been published under the title _Edwin M.
Stanton, an Address by Andrew Carnegie on Stanton Memorial Day at
Kenyon College_. (New York, 1906.)]

That was exactly what he did. And that was Grant's way of putting
strategy into words. It was my privilege to become well acquainted
with him in after years. If ever a man was without the slightest trace
of affectation, Grant was that man. Even Lincoln did not surpass him
in that: but Grant was a quiet, slow man while Lincoln was always
alive and in motion. I never heard Grant use a long or grand word, or
make any attempt at "manner," but the general impression that he was
always reticent is a mistake. He was a surprisingly good talker
sometimes and upon occasion liked to talk. His sentences were always
short and to the point, and his observations upon things remarkably
shrewd. When he had nothing to say he said nothing. I noticed that he
was never tired of praising his subordinates in the war. He spoke of
them as a fond father speaks of his children.

The story is told that during the trials of war in the West, General
Grant began to indulge too freely in liquor. His chief of staff,
Rawlins, boldly ventured to tell him so. That this was the act of a
true friend Grant fully recognized.

"You do not mean that? I was wholly unconscious of it. I am
surprised!" said the General.

"Yes, I do mean it. It is even beginning to be a subject of comment
among your officers."

"Why did you not tell me before? I'll never drink a drop of liquor
again."

He never did. Time after time in later years, dining with the Grants
in New York, I have seen the General turn down the wine-glasses at his
side. That indomitable will of his enabled him to remain steadfast to
his resolve, a rare case as far as my experience goes. Some have
refrained for a time. In one noted case one of our partners refrained
for three years, but alas, the old enemy at last recaptured its
victim.

Grant, when President, was accused of being pecuniarily benefited by
certain appointments, or acts, of his administration, while his
friends knew that he was so poor that he had been compelled to
announce his intention of abandoning the customary state dinners, each
one of which, he found, cost eight hundred dollars--a sum which he
could not afford to pay out of his salary. The increase of the
presidential salary from $25,000 to $50,000 a year enabled him, during
his second term, to save a little, although he cared no more about
money than about uniforms. At the end of his first term I know he had
nothing. Yet I found, when in Europe, that the impression was
widespread among the highest officials there that there was something
in the charge that General Grant had benefited pecuniarily by
appointments. We know in America how little weight to attach to these
charges, but it would have been well for those who made them so
recklessly to have considered what effect they would produce upon
public opinion in other lands.

The cause of democracy suffers more in Britain to-day from the
generally received opinion that American politics are corrupt, and
therefore that republicanism necessarily produces corruption, than
from any other one cause. Yet, speaking with some knowledge of
politics in both lands, I have not the slightest hesitation in saying
that for every ounce of corruption of public men in the new land of
republicanism there is one in the old land of monarchy, only the forms
of corruption differ. Titles are the bribes in the monarchy, not
dollars. Office is a common and proper reward in both. There is,
however, this difference in favor of the monarchy; titles are given
openly and are not considered by the recipients or the mass of the
people as bribes.

When I was called to Washington in 1861, it was supposed that the war
would soon be over; but it was seen shortly afterwards that it was to
be a question of years. Permanent officials in charge would be
required. The Pennsylvania Railroad Company was unable to spare Mr.
Scott, and Mr. Scott, in turn, decided that I must return to
Pittsburgh, where my services were urgently needed, owing to the
demands made upon the Pennsylvania by the Government. We therefore
placed the department at Washington in the hands of others and
returned to our respective positions.

After my return from Washington reaction followed and I was taken with
my first serious illness. I was completely broken down, and after a
struggle to perform my duties was compelled to seek rest. One
afternoon, when on the railway line in Virginia, I had experienced
something like a sunstroke, which gave me considerable trouble. It
passed off, however, but after that I found I could not stand heat and
had to be careful to keep out of the sun--a hot day wilting me
completely. [That is the reason why the cool Highland air in summer
has been to me a panacea for many years. My physician has insisted
that I must avoid our hot American summers.]

Leave of absence was granted me by the Pennsylvania Railroad Company,
and the long-sought opportunity to visit Scotland came. My mother, my
bosom friend Tom Miller, and myself, sailed in the steamship Etna,
June 28, 1862, I in my twenty-seventh year; and on landing in
Liverpool we proceeded at once to Dunfermline. No change ever affected
me so much as this return to my native land. I seemed to be in a
dream. Every mile that brought us nearer to Scotland increased the
intensity of my feelings. My mother was equally moved, and I remember,
when her eyes first caught sight of the familiar yellow bush, she
exclaimed:

"Oh! there's the broom, the broom!"

Her heart was so full she could not restrain her tears, and the more I
tried to make light of it or to soothe her, the more she was overcome.
For myself, I felt as if I could throw myself upon the sacred soil and
kiss it.[22]

[Footnote 22: "It's a God's mercy I was born a Scotchman, for I do not
see how I could ever have been contented to be anything else. The
little dour deevil, set in her own ways, and getting them, too,
level-headed and shrewd, with an eye to the main chance always and yet
so lovingly weak, so fond, so led away by song or story, so easily
touched to fine issues, so leal, so true. Ah! you suit me, Scotia, and
proud am I that I am your son." (Andrew Carnegie, _Our Coaching Trip_,
p. 152. New York, 1882.)]

In this mood we reached Dunfermline. Every object we passed was
recognized at once, but everything seemed so small, compared with what
I had imagined it, that I was completely puzzled. Finally, reaching
Uncle Lauder's and getting into the old room where he had taught Dod
and myself so many things, I exclaimed:

"You are all here; everything is just as I left it, but you are now
all playing with toys."

The High Street, which I had considered not a bad Broadway, uncle's
shop, which I had compared with some New York establishments, the
little mounds about the town, to which we had run on Sundays to play,
the distances, the height of the houses, all had shrunk. Here was a
city of the Lilliputians. I could almost touch the eaves of the house
in which I was born, and the sea--to walk to which on a Saturday had
been considered quite a feat--was only three miles distant. The rocks
at the seashore, among which I had gathered wilks (whelks) seemed to
have vanished, and a tame flat shoal remained. The schoolhouse, around
which had centered many of my schoolboy recollections--my only Alma
Mater--and the playground, upon which mimic battles had been fought
and races run, had shrunk into ridiculously small dimensions. The fine
residences, Broomhall, Fordell, and especially the conservatories at
Donibristle, fell one after the other into the petty and
insignificant. What I felt on a later occasion on a visit to Japan,
with its small toy houses, was something like a repetition of the
impression my old home made upon me.

Everything was there in miniature. Even the old well at the head of
Moodie Street, where I began my early struggles, was changed from what
I had pictured it. But one object remained all that I had dreamed of
it. There was no disappointment in the glorious old Abbey and its
Glen. It was big enough and grand enough, and the memorable carved
letters on the top of the tower--"King Robert The Bruce"--filled my
eye and my heart as fully as of old. Nor was the Abbey bell
disappointing, when I heard it for the first time after my return. For
this I was grateful. It gave me a rallying point, and around the old
Abbey, with its Palace ruins and the Glen, other objects adjusted
themselves in their true proportions after a time.

My relatives were exceedingly kind, and the oldest of all, my dear old
Auntie Charlotte, in a moment of exultation exclaimed:

"Oh, you will just be coming back here some day and _keep a shop in
the High Street_."

To keep a shop in the High Street was her idea of triumph. Her
son-in-law and daughter, both my full cousins, though unrelated to
each other, had risen to this sublime height, and nothing was too
great to predict for her promising nephew. There is an aristocracy
even in shopkeeping, and the family of the green grocer of the High
Street mingles not upon equal terms with him of Moodie Street.

Auntie, who had often played my nurse, liked to dwell upon the fact
that I was a screaming infant that had to be fed with two spoons, as I
yelled whenever one left my mouth. Captain Jones, our superintendent
of the steel works at a later day, described me as having been born
"with two rows of teeth and holes punched for more," so insatiable was
my appetite for new works and increased production. As I was the first
child in our immediate family circle, there were plenty of now
venerable relatives begging to be allowed to play nurse, my aunties
among them. Many of my childhood pranks and words they told me in
their old age. One of them that the aunties remembered struck me as
rather precocious.

I had been brought up upon wise saws and one that my father had taught
me was soon given direct application. As a boy, returning from the
seashore three miles distant, he had to carry me part of the way upon
his back. Going up a steep hill in the gloaming he remarked upon the
heavy load, hoping probably I would propose to walk a bit. The
response, however, which he received was:

"Ah, faither, never mind, patience and perseverance make the man, ye
ken."

He toiled on with his burden, but shaking with laughter. He was hoist
with his own petard, but his burden grew lighter all the same. I am
sure of this.

My home, of course, was with my instructor, guide, and inspirer, Uncle
Lauder--he who had done so much to make me romantic, patriotic, and
poetical at eight. Now I was twenty-seven, but Uncle Lauder still
remained Uncle Lauder. He had not shrunk, no one could fill his place.
We had our walks and talks constantly and I was "Naig" again to him.
He had never had any name for me but that and never did have. My dear,
dear uncle, and more, much more than uncle to me.[23]

[Footnote 23: "This uncle, who loved liberty because it is the
heritage of brave souls, in the dark days of the American Civil War
stood almost alone in his community for the cause which Lincoln
represented." (Hamilton Wright Mabie in _Century Magazine_, vol. 64,
p. 958.)]

I was still dreaming and so excited that I could not sleep and had
caught cold in the bargain. The natural result of this was a fever. I
lay in uncle's house for six weeks, a part of that time in a critical
condition. Scottish medicine was then as stern as Scottish theology
(both are now much softened), and I was bled. My thin American blood
was so depleted that when I was pronounced convalescent it was long
before I could stand upon my feet. This illness put an end to my
visit, but by the time I had reached America again, the ocean voyage
had done me so much good I was able to resume work.

I remember being deeply affected by the reception I met with when I
returned to my division. The men of the eastern end had gathered
together with a cannon and while the train passed I was greeted with a
salvo. This was perhaps the first occasion upon which my subordinates
had an opportunity of making me the subject of any demonstration, and
their reception made a lasting impression. I knew how much I cared for
them and it was pleasing to know that they reciprocated my feelings.
Working-men always do reciprocate kindly feeling. If we truly care for
others we need not be anxious about their feelings for us. Like draws
to like.




CHAPTER IX

BRIDGE-BUILDING


During the Civil War the price of iron went up to something like $130
per ton. Even at that figure it was not so much a question of money as
of delivery. The railway lines of America were fast becoming dangerous
for want of new rails, and this state of affairs led me to organize in
1864 a rail-making concern at Pittsburgh. There was no difficulty in
obtaining partners and capital, and the Superior Rail Mill and Blast
Furnaces were built.

In like manner the demand for locomotives was very great, and with Mr.
Thomas N. Miller[24] I organized in 1866 the Pittsburgh Locomotive
Works, which has been a prosperous and creditable concern--locomotives
made there having obtained an enviable reputation throughout the
United States. It sounds like a fairy tale to-day to record that in
1906 the one-hundred-dollar shares of this company sold for three
thousand dollars--that is, thirty dollars for one. Large annual
dividends had been paid regularly and the company had been very
successful--sufficient proof of the policy: "Make nothing but the very
best." We never did.

[Footnote 24: Mr. Carnegie had previous to this--as early as
1861--been associated with Mr. Miller in the Sun City Forge Company,
doing a small iron business.]

When at Altoona I had seen in the Pennsylvania Railroad Company's
works the first small bridge built of iron. It proved a success. I saw
that it would never do to depend further upon wooden bridges for
permanent railway structures. An important bridge on the Pennsylvania
Railroad had recently burned and the traffic had been obstructed for
eight days. Iron was the thing. I proposed to H.J. Linville, who had
designed the iron bridge, and to John L. Piper and his partner, Mr.
Schiffler, who had charge of bridges on the Pennsylvania line, that
they should come to Pittsburgh and I would organize a company to build
iron bridges. It was the first company of its kind. I asked my friend,
Mr. Scott, of the Pennsylvania Railroad, to go with us in the venture,
which he did. Each of us paid for a one fifth interest, or $1250. My
share I borrowed from the bank. Looking back at it now the sum seemed
very small, but "tall oaks from little acorns grow."

In this way was organized in 1862 the firm of Piper and Schiffler
which was merged into the Keystone Bridge Company in 1863--a name
which I remember I was proud of having thought of as being most
appropriate for a bridge-building concern in the State of
Pennsylvania, the Keystone State. From this beginning iron bridges
came generally into use in America, indeed, in the world at large so
far as I know. My letters to iron manufacturers in Pittsburgh were
sufficient to insure the new company credit. Small wooden shops were
erected and several bridge structures were undertaken. Cast-iron was
the principal material used, but so well were the bridges built that
some made at that day and since strengthened for heavier traffic,
still remain in use upon various lines.

The question of bridging the Ohio River at Steubenville came up, and
we were asked whether we would undertake to build a railway bridge
with a span of three hundred feet over the channel. It seems
ridiculous at the present day to think of the serious doubts
entertained about our ability to do this; but it must be remembered
this was before the days of steel and almost before the use of
wrought-iron in America. The top cords and supports were all of
cast-iron. I urged my partners to try it anyhow, and we finally closed
a contract, but I remember well when President Jewett[25] of the
railway company visited the works and cast his eyes upon the piles of
heavy cast-iron lying about, which were parts of the forthcoming
bridge, that he turned to me and said:

"I don't believe these heavy castings can be made to stand up and
carry themselves, much less carry a train across the Ohio River."

[Footnote 25: Thomas L. Jewett, President of the Panhandle.]

The Judge, however, lived to believe differently. The bridge remained
until recently, though strengthened to carry heavier traffic. We
expected to make quite a sum by this first important undertaking, but
owing to the inflation of the currency, which occurred before the work
was finished, our margin of profit was almost swallowed up. It is an
evidence of the fairness of President Edgar Thomson, of the
Pennsylvania, that, upon learning the facts of the case, he allowed an
extra sum to secure us from loss. The subsequent position of affairs,
he said, was not contemplated by either party when the contract was
made. A great and a good man was Edgar Thomson, a close bargainer for
the Pennsylvania Railroad, but ever mindful of the fact that the
spirit of the law was above the letter.

In Linville, Piper, and Schiffler, we had the best talent of that
day--Linville an engineer, Piper a hustling, active mechanic, and
Schiffler sure and steady. Colonel Piper was an exceptional man. I
heard President Thomson of the Pennsylvania once say he would rather
have him at a burnt bridge than all the engineering corps. There was
one subject upon which the Colonel displayed great weakness
(fortunately for us) and that was the horse. Whenever a business
discussion became too warm, and the Colonel showed signs of temper,
which was not seldom, it was a sure cure to introduce that subject.
Everything else would pass from his mind; he became absorbed in the
fascinating topic of horseflesh. If he had overworked himself, and we
wished to get him to take a holiday, we sent him to Kentucky to look
after a horse or two that one or the other of us was desirous of
obtaining, and for the selection of which we would trust no one but
himself. But his craze for horses sometimes brought him into serious
difficulties. He made his appearance at the office one day with one
half of his face as black as mud could make it, his clothes torn, and
his hat missing, but still holding the whip in one hand. He explained
that he had attempted to drive a fast Kentucky colt; one of the reins
had broken and he had lost his "steerage-way," as he expressed it.

He was a grand fellow, "Pipe" as we called him, and when he took a
fancy to a person, as he did to me, he was for and with him always. In
later days when I removed to New York he transferred his affections to
my brother, whom he invariably called Thomas, instead of Tom. High as
I stood in his favor, my brother afterwards stood higher. He fairly
worshiped him, and anything that Tom said was law and gospel. He was
exceedingly jealous of our other establishments, in which he was not
directly interested, such as our mills which supplied the Keystone
Works with iron. Many a dispute arose between the mill managers and
the Colonel as to quality, price, and so forth. On one occasion he
came to my brother to complain that a bargain which he had made for
the supply of iron for a year had not been copied correctly. The
prices were "net," and nothing had been said about "net" when the
bargain was made. He wanted to know just what that word "net" meant.

"Well, Colonel," said my brother, "it means that nothing more is to be
added."

"All right, Thomas," said the Colonel, entirely satisfied.

There is much in the way one puts things. "Nothing to be deducted"
might have caused a dispute.

[Illustration: THOMAS MORRISON CARNEGIE]

He was made furious one day by Bradstreet's volume which gives the
standing of business concerns. Never having seen such a book before,
he was naturally anxious to see what rating his concern had. When he
read that the Keystone Bridge Works were "BC," which meant "Bad
Credit," it was with difficulty he was restrained from going to see
our lawyers to have a suit brought against the publishers. Tom,
however, explained to him that the Keystone Bridge Works were in bad
credit because they never borrowed anything, and he was pacified. No
debt was one of the Colonel's hobbies. Once, when I was leaving for
Europe, when many firms were hard up and some failing around us, he
said to me:

"The sheriff can't get us when you are gone if I don't sign any notes,
can he?"

"No," I said, "he can't."

"All right, we'll be here when you come back."

Talking of the Colonel reminds me of another unusual character with
whom we were brought in contact in these bridge-building days. This
was Captain Eads, of St. Louis,[26] an original genius _minus_
scientific knowledge to guide his erratic ideas of things mechanical.
He was seemingly one of those who wished to have everything done upon
his own original plans. That a thing had been done in one way before
was sufficient to cause its rejection. When his plans for the St.
Louis Bridge were presented to us, I handed them to the one man in the
United States who knew the subject best--our Mr. Linville. He came to
me in great concern, saying:

"The bridge if built upon these plans will not stand up; it will not
carry its own weight."

"Well," I said, "Captain Eads will come to see you and in talking over
matters explain this to him gently, get it into proper shape, lead him
into the straight path and say nothing about it to others."

[Footnote 26: Captain James B. Eads, afterward famous for his jetty
system in the Mississippi River.]

This was successfully accomplished; but in the construction of the
bridge poor Piper was totally unable to comply with the extraordinary
requirements of the Captain. At first he was so delighted with having
received the largest contract that had yet been let that he was all
graciousness to Captain Eads. It was not even "Captain" at first, but
"'Colonel' Eads, how do you do? Delighted to see you." By and by
matters became a little complicated. We noticed that the greeting
became less cordial, but still it was "Good-morning, Captain Eads."
This fell till we were surprised to hear "Pipe" talking of "Mr. Eads."
Before the troubles were over, the "Colonel" had fallen to "Jim Eads,"
and to tell the truth, long before the work was out of the shops,
"Jim" was now and then preceded by a big "D." A man may be possessed
of great ability, and be a charming, interesting character, as Captain
Eads undoubtedly was, and yet not be able to construct the first
bridge of five hundred feet span over the Mississippi River,[27]
without availing himself of the scientific knowledge and practical
experience of others.

[Footnote 27: The span was 515 feet, and at that time considered the
finest metal arch in the world.]

When the work was finished, I had the Colonel with me in St. Louis for
some days protecting the bridge against a threatened attempt on the
part of others to take possession of it before we obtained full
payment. When the Colonel had taken up the planks at both ends, and
organized a plan of relieving the men who stood guard, he became
homesick and exceedingly anxious to return to Pittsburgh. He had
determined to take the night train and I was at a loss to know how to
keep him with me until I thought of his one vulnerable point. I told
him, during the day, how anxious I was to obtain a pair of horses for
my sister. I wished to make her a present of a span, and I had heard
that St. Louis was a noted place for them. Had he seen anything
superb?

The bait took. He launched forth into a description of several spans
of horses he had seen and stables he had visited. I asked him if he
could possibly stay over and select the horses. I knew very well that
he would wish to see them and drive them many times which would keep
him busy. It happened just as I expected. He purchased a splendid
pair, but then another difficulty occurred about transporting them to
Pittsburgh. He would not trust them by rail and no suitable boat was
to leave for several days. Providence was on my side evidently.
Nothing on earth would induce that man to leave the city until he saw
those horses fairly started and it was an even wager whether he would
not insist upon going up on the steamer with them himself. We held the
bridge. "Pipe" made a splendid Horatius. He was one of the best men
and one of the most valuable partners I ever was favored with, and
richly deserved the rewards which he did so much to secure.

The Keystone Bridge Works have always been a source of satisfaction to
me. Almost every concern that had undertaken to erect iron bridges in
America had failed. Many of the structures themselves had fallen and
some of the worst railway disasters in America had been caused in that
way. Some of the bridges had given way under wind pressure but nothing
has ever happened to a Keystone bridge, and some of them have stood
where the wind was not tempered. There has been no luck about it. We
used only the best material and enough of it, making our own iron and
later our own steel. We were our own severest inspectors, and would
build a safe structure or none at all. When asked to build a bridge
which we knew to be of insufficient strength or of unscientific
design, we resolutely declined. Any piece of work bearing the stamp of
the Keystone Bridge Works (and there are few States in the Union where
such are not to be found) we were prepared to underwrite. We were as
proud of our bridges as Carlyle was of the bridge his father built
across the Annan. "An honest brig," as the great son rightly said.

This policy is the true secret of success. Uphill work it will be for
a few years until your work is proven, but after that it is smooth
sailing. Instead of objecting to inspectors they should be welcomed by
all manufacturing establishments. A high standard of excellence is
easily maintained, and men are educated in the effort to reach
excellence. I have never known a concern to make a decided success
that did not do good, honest work, and even in these days of the
fiercest competition, when everything would seem to be matter of
price, there lies still at the root of great business success the very
much more important factor of quality. The effect of attention to
quality, upon every man in the service, from the president of the
concern down to the humblest laborer, cannot be overestimated. And
bearing on the same question, clean, fine workshops and tools,
well-kept yards and surroundings are of much greater importance than
is usually supposed.

I was very much pleased to hear a remark, made by one of the prominent
bankers who visited the Edgar Thomson Works during a Bankers
Convention held at Pittsburgh. He was one of a party of some hundreds
of delegates, and after they had passed through the works he said to
our manager:

"Somebody appears to belong to these works."

He put his finger there upon one of the secrets of success. They did
belong to somebody. The president of an important manufacturing work
once boasted to me that their men had chased away the first inspector
who had ventured to appear among them, and that they had never been
troubled with another since. This was said as a matter of sincere
congratulation, but I thought to myself: "This concern will never
stand the strain of competition; it is bound to fail when hard times
come." The result proved the correctness of my belief. The surest
foundation of a manufacturing concern is quality. After that, and a
long way after, comes cost.

I gave a great deal of personal attention for some years to the
affairs of the Keystone Bridge Works, and when important contracts
were involved often went myself to meet the parties. On one such
occasion in 1868, I visited Dubuque, Iowa, with our engineer, Walter
Katte. We were competing for the building of the most important
railway bridge that had been built up to that time, a bridge across
the wide Mississippi at Dubuque, to span which was considered a great
undertaking. We found the river frozen and crossed it upon a sleigh
drawn by four horses.

That visit proved how much success turns upon trifles. We found we
were not the lowest bidder. Our chief rival was a bridge-building
concern in Chicago to which the board had decided to award the
contract. I lingered and talked with some of the directors. They were
delightfully ignorant of the merits of cast- and wrought-iron. We had
always made the upper cord of the bridge of the latter, while our
rivals' was made of cast-iron. This furnished my text. I pictured the
result of a steamer striking against the one and against the other. In
the case of the wrought-iron cord it would probably only bend; in the
case of the cast-iron it would certainly break and down would come the
bridge. One of the directors, the well-known Perry Smith, was
fortunately able to enforce my argument, by stating to the board that
what I said was undoubtedly the case about cast-iron. The other night
he had run his buggy in the dark against a lamp-post which was of
cast-iron and the lamp-post had broken to pieces. Am I to be censured
if I had little difficulty here in recognizing something akin to the
hand of Providence, with Perry Smith the manifest agent?

"Ah, gentlemen," I said, "there is the point. A little more money and
you could have had the indestructible wrought-iron and your bridge
would stand against any steamboat. We never have built and we never
will build a cheap bridge. Ours don't fall."

There was a pause; then the president of the bridge company, Mr.
Allison, the great Senator, asked if I would excuse them for a few
moments. I retired. Soon they recalled me and offered the contract,
provided we took the lower price, which was only a few thousand
dollars less. I agreed to the concession. That cast-iron lamp-post so
opportunely smashed gave us one of our most profitable contracts and,
what is more, obtained for us the reputation of having taken the
Dubuque bridge against all competitors. It also laid the foundation
for me of a lifelong, unbroken friendship with one of America's best
and most valuable public men, Senator Allison.

The moral of that story lies on the surface. If you want a contract,
be on the spot when it is let. A smashed lamp-post or something
equally unthought of may secure the prize if the bidder be on hand.
And if possible stay on hand until you can take the written contract
home in your pocket. This we did at Dubuque, although it was suggested
we could leave and it would be sent after us to execute. We preferred
to remain, being anxious to see more of the charms of Dubuque.

After building the Steubenville Bridge, it became a necessity for the
Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company to build bridges across the Ohio
River at Parkersburg and Wheeling, to prevent their great rival, the
Pennsylvania Railroad Company, from possessing a decided advantage.
The days of ferryboats were then fast passing away. It was in
connection with the contracts for these bridges that I had the
pleasure of making the acquaintance of a man, then of great position,
Mr. Garrett, president of the Baltimore and Ohio.

We were most anxious to secure both bridges and all the approaches to
them, but I found Mr. Garrett decidedly of the opinion that we were
quite unable to do so much work in the time specified. He wished to
build the approaches and the short spans in his own shops, and asked
me if we would permit him to use our patents. I replied that we would
feel highly honored by the Baltimore and Ohio doing so. The stamp of
approval of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad would be worth ten times
the patent fees. He could use all, and everything, we had.

There was no doubt as to the favorable impression that made upon the
great railway magnate. He was much pleased and, to my utter surprise,
took me into his private room and opened up a frank conversation upon
matters in general. He touched especially upon his quarrels with the
Pennsylvania Railroad people, with Mr. Thomson and Mr. Scott, the
president and vice-president, whom he knew to be my special friends.
This led me to say that I had passed through Philadelphia on my way to
see him and had been asked by Mr. Scott where I was going.

"I told him that I was going to visit you to obtain the contracts for
your great bridges over the Ohio River. Mr. Scott said it was not
often that I went on a fool's errand, but that I was certainly on one
now; that Mr. Garrett would never think for a moment of giving me his
contracts, for every one knew that I was, as a former employee, always
friendly to the Pennsylvania Railroad. Well, I said, we shall build
Mr. Garrett's bridges."

Mr. Garrett promptly replied that when the interests of his company
were at stake it was the best always that won. His engineers had
reported that our plans were the best and that Scott and Thomson would
see that he had only one rule--the interests of his company. Although
he very well knew that I was a Pennsylvania Railroad man, yet he felt
it his duty to award us the work.

The negotiation was still unsatisfactory to me, because we were to get
all the difficult part of the work--the great spans of which the risk
was then considerable--while Mr. Garrett was to build all the small
and profitable spans at his own shops upon our plans and patents. I
ventured to ask whether he was dividing the work because he honestly
believed we could not open his bridges for traffic as soon as his
masonry would permit. He admitted he was. I told him that he need not
have any fear upon that point.

"Mr. Garrett," I said, "would you consider my personal bond a good
security?"

"Certainly," he said.

"Well, now," I replied, "bind me! I know what I am doing. I will take
the risk. How much of a bond do you want me to give you that your
bridges will be opened for traffic at the specified time if you give
us the entire contract, provided you get your masonry ready?"

"Well, I would want a hundred thousand dollars from you, young man."

"All right," I said, "prepare your bond. Give us the work. Our firm is
not going to let me lose a hundred thousand dollars. You know that."

"Yes," he said, "I believe if you are bound for a hundred thousand
dollars your company will work day and night and I will get my
bridges."

This was the arrangement which gave us what were then the gigantic
contracts of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. It is needless to say
that I never had to pay that bond. My partners knew much better than
Mr. Garrett the conditions of his work. The Ohio River was not to be
trifled with, and long before his masonry was ready we had relieved
ourselves from all responsibility upon the bond by placing the
superstructure on the banks awaiting the completion of the
substructure which he was still building.

Mr. Garrett was very proud of his Scottish blood, and Burns having
been once touched upon between us we became firm friends. He
afterwards took me to his fine mansion in the country. He was one of
the few Americans who then lived in the grand style of a country
gentleman, with many hundreds of acres of beautiful land, park-like
drives, a stud of thoroughbred horses, with cattle, sheep, and dogs,
and a home that realized what one had read of the country life of a
nobleman in England.

At a later date he had fully determined that his railroad company
should engage in the manufacture of steel rails and had applied for
the right to use the Bessemer patents. This was a matter of great
moment to us. The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company was one of our
best customers, and we were naturally anxious to prevent the building
of steel-rail rolling mills at Cumberland. It would have been a losing
enterprise for the Baltimore and Ohio, for I was sure it could buy its
steel rails at a much cheaper rate than it could possibly make the
small quantity needed for itself. I visited Mr. Garrett to talk the
matter over with him. He was then much pleased with the foreign
commerce and the lines of steamships which made Baltimore their port.
He drove me, accompanied by several of his staff, to the wharves where
he was to decide about their extension, and as the foreign goods were
being discharged from the steamship side and placed in the railway
cars, he turned to me and said:

"Mr. Carnegie, you can now begin to appreciate the magnitude of our
vast system and understand why it is necessary that we should make
everything for ourselves, even our steel rails. We cannot depend upon
private concerns to supply us with any of the principal articles we
consume. We shall be a world to ourselves."

"Well," I said, "Mr. Garrett, it is all very grand, but really your
'vast system' does not overwhelm me. I read your last annual report
and saw that you collected last year for transporting the goods of
others the sum of fourteen millions of dollars. The firms I control
dug the material from the hills, made their own goods, and sold them
to a much greater value than that. You are really a very small concern
compared with Carnegie Brothers and Company."

My railroad apprenticeship came in there to advantage. We heard no
more of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company entering into
competition with us. Mr. Garrett and I remained good friends to the
end. He even presented me with a Scotch collie dog of his own rearing.
That I had been a Pennsylvania Railroad man was drowned in the "wee
drap o' Scotch bluid atween us."




CHAPTER X

THE IRON WORKS


The Keystone Works have always been my pet as being the parent of all
the other works. But they had not been long in existence before the
advantage of wrought- over cast-iron became manifest. Accordingly, to
insure uniform quality, and also to make certain shapes which were not
then to be obtained, we determined to embark in the manufacture of
iron. My brother and I became interested with Thomas N. Miller, Henry
Phipps, and Andrew Kloman in a small iron mill. Miller was the first
to embark with Kloman and he brought Phipps in, lending him eight
hundred dollars to buy a one-sixth interest, in November, 1861.

I must not fail to record that Mr. Miller was the pioneer of our iron
manufacturing projects. We were all indebted to Tom, who still lives
(July 20, 1911) and sheds upon us the sweetness and light of a most
lovable nature, a friend who grows more precious as the years roll by.
He has softened by age, and even his outbursts against theology as
antagonistic to true religion are in his fine old age much less
alarming. We are all prone to grow philosophic in age, and perhaps
this is well. [In re-reading this--July 19, 1912--in our retreat upon
the high moors at Aultnagar, I drop a tear for my bosom friend, dear
Tom Miller, who died in Pittsburgh last winter. Mrs. Carnegie and I
attended his funeral. Henceforth life lacks something, lacks much--my
first partner in early years, my dearest friend in old age. May I go
where he is, wherever that may be.]

Andrew Kloman had a small steel-hammer in Allegheny City. As a
superintendent of the Pennsylvania Railroad I had found that he made
the best axles. He was a great mechanic--one who had discovered, what
was then unknown in Pittsburgh, that whatever was worth doing with
machinery was worth doing well. His German mind made him thorough.
What he constructed cost enormously, but when once started it did the
work it was intended to do from year's end to year's end. In those
early days it was a question with axles generally whether they would
run any specified time or break. There was no analysis of material, no
scientific treatment of it.

How much this German created! He was the first man to introduce the
cold saw that cut cold iron the exact lengths. He invented upsetting
machines to make bridge links, and also built the first "universal"
mill in America. All these were erected at our works. When Captain
Eads could not obtain the couplings for the St. Louis Bridge arches
(the contractors failing to make them) and matters were at a
standstill, Kloman told us that he could make them and why the others
had failed. He succeeded in making them. Up to that date they were the
largest semicircles that had ever been rolled. Our confidence in Mr.
Kloman may be judged from the fact that when he said he could make
them we unhesitatingly contracted to furnish them.

I have already spoken of the intimacy between our family and that of
the Phippses. In the early days my chief companion was the elder
brother, John. Henry was several years my junior, but had not failed
to attract my attention as a bright, clever lad. One day he asked his
brother John to lend him a quarter of a dollar. John saw that he had
important use for it and handed him the shining quarter without
inquiry. Next morning an advertisement appeared in the "Pittsburgh
Dispatch":

"A willing boy wishes work."

This was the use the energetic and willing Harry had made of his
quarter, probably the first quarter he had ever spent at one time in
his life. A response came from the well-known firm of Dilworth and
Bidwell. They asked the "willing boy" to call. Harry went and obtained
a position as errand boy, and as was then the custom, his first duty
every morning was to sweep the office. He went to his parents and
obtained their consent, and in this way the young lad launched himself
upon the sea of business. There was no holding back a boy like that.
It was the old story. He soon became indispensable to his employers,
obtained a small interest in a collateral branch of their business;
and then, ever on the alert, it was not many years before he attracted
the attention of Mr. Miller, who made a small investment for him with
Andrew Kloman. That finally resulted in the building of the iron mill
in Twenty-Ninth Street. He had been a schoolmate and great crony of my
brother Tom. As children they had played together, and throughout
life, until my brother's death in 1886, these two formed, as it were,
a partnership within a partnership. They invariably held equal
interests in the various firms with which they were connected. What
one did the other did.

The errand boy is now one of the richest men in the United States and
has begun to prove that he knows how to expend his surplus. Years ago
he gave beautiful conservatories to the public parks of Allegheny and
Pittsburgh. That he specified "that these should be open upon Sunday"
shows that he is a man of his time. This clause in the gift created
much excitement. Ministers denounced him from the pulpit and
assemblies of the church passed resolutions declaring against the
desecration of the Lord's Day. But the people rose, _en masse_,
against this narrow-minded contention and the Council of the city
accepted the gift with acclamation. The sound common sense of my
partner was well expressed when he said in reply to a remonstrance by
ministers:

"It is all very well for you, gentlemen, who work one day in the week
and are masters of your time the other six during which you can view
the beauties of Nature--all very well for you--but I think it shameful
that you should endeavor to shut out from the toiling masses all that
is calculated to entertain and instruct them during the only day which
you well know they have at their disposal."

These same ministers have recently been quarreling in their convention
at Pittsburgh upon the subject of instrumental music in churches. But
while they are debating whether it is right to have organs in
churches, intelligent people are opening museums, conservatories, and
libraries upon the Sabbath; and unless the pulpit soon learns how to
meet the real wants of the people in this life (where alone men's
duties lie) much better than it is doing at present, these rival
claimants for popular favor may soon empty their churches.

Unfortunately Kloman and Phipps soon differed with Miller about the
business and forced him out. Being convinced that Miller was unfairly
treated, I united with him in building new works. These were the
Cyclops Mills of 1864. After they were set running it became possible,
and therefore advisable, to unite the old and the new works, and the
Union Iron Mills were formed by their consolidation in 1867. I did
not believe that Mr. Miller's reluctance to associate again with his
former partners, Phipps and Kloman, could not be overcome, because
they would not control the Union Works. Mr. Miller, my brother, and I
would hold the controlling interest. But Mr. Miller proved obdurate
and begged me to buy his interest, which I reluctantly did after all
efforts had failed to induce him to let bygones be bygones. He was
Irish, and the Irish blood when aroused is uncontrollable. Mr. Miller
has since regretted (to me) his refusal of my earnest request, which
would have enabled the pioneer of all of us to reap what was only his
rightful reward--millionairedom for himself and his followers.

We were young in manufacturing then and obtained for the Cyclops Mills
what was considered at the time an enormous extent of land--seven
acres. For some years we offered to lease a portion of the ground to
others. It soon became a question whether we could continue the
manufacture of iron within so small an area. Mr. Kloman succeeded in
making iron beams and for many years our mill was far in advance of
any other in that respect. We began at the new mill by making all
shapes which were required, and especially such as no other concern
would undertake, depending upon an increasing demand in our growing
country for things that were only rarely needed at first. What others
could not or would not do we would attempt, and this was a rule of our
business which was strictly adhered to. Also we would make nothing
except of excellent quality. We always accommodated our customers,
even although at some expense to ourselves, and in cases of dispute we
gave the other party the benefit of the doubt and settled. These were
our rules. We had no lawsuits.

As I became acquainted with the manufacture of iron I was greatly
surprised to find that the cost of each of the various processes was
unknown. Inquiries made of the leading manufacturers of Pittsburgh
proved this. It was a lump business, and until stock was taken and the
books balanced at the end of the year, the manufacturers were in total
ignorance of results. I heard of men who thought their business at the
end of the year would show a loss and had found a profit, and
_vice-versa_. I felt as if we were moles burrowing in the dark, and
this to me was intolerable. I insisted upon such a system of weighing
and accounting being introduced throughout our works as would enable
us to know what our cost was for each process and especially what each
man was doing, who saved material, who wasted it, and who produced the
best results.

To arrive at this was a much more difficult task than one would
imagine. Every manager in the mills was naturally against the new
system. Years were required before an accurate system was obtained,
but eventually, by the aid of many clerks and the introduction of
weighing scales at various points in the mill, we began to know not
only what every department was doing, but what each one of the many
men working at the furnaces was doing, and thus to compare one with
another. One of the chief sources of success in manufacturing is the
introduction and strict maintenance of a perfect system of accounting
so that responsibility for money or materials can be brought home to
every man. Owners who, in the office, would not trust a clerk with
five dollars without having a check upon him, were supplying tons of
material daily to men in the mills without exacting an account of
their stewardship by weighing what each returned in the finished
form.

The Siemens Gas Furnace had been used to some extent in Great Britain
for heating steel and iron, but it was supposed to be too expensive. I
well remember the criticisms made by older heads among the Pittsburgh
manufacturers about the extravagant expenditure we were making upon
these new-fangled furnaces. But in the heating of great masses of
material, almost half the waste could sometimes be saved by using the
new furnaces. The expenditure would have been justified, even if it
had been doubled. Yet it was many years before we were followed in
this new departure; and in some of those years the margin of profit
was so small that the most of it was made up from the savings derived
from the adoption of the improved furnaces.

Our strict system of accounting enabled us to detect the great waste
possible in heating large masses of iron. This improvement revealed to
us a valuable man in a clerk, William Borntraeger, a distant relative
of Mr. Kloman, who came from Germany. He surprised us one day by
presenting a detailed statement showing results for a period, which
seemed incredible. All the needed labor in preparing this statement he
had performed at night unasked and unknown to us. The form adapted was
uniquely original. Needless to say, William soon became superintendent
of the works and later a partner, and the poor German lad died a
millionaire. He well deserved his fortune.

It was in 1862 that the great oil wells of Pennsylvania attracted
attention. My friend Mr. William Coleman, whose daughter became, at a
later date, my sister-in-law, was deeply interested in the discovery,
and nothing would do but that I should take a trip with him to the oil
regions. It was a most interesting excursion. There had been a rush to
the oil fields and the influx was so great that it was impossible for
all to obtain shelter. This, however, to the class of men who flocked
thither, was but a slight drawback. A few hours sufficed to knock up a
shanty, and it was surprising in how short a time they were able to
surround themselves with many of the comforts of life. They were men
above the average, men who had saved considerable sums and were able
to venture something in the search for fortune.

What surprised me was the good humor which prevailed everywhere. It
was a vast picnic, full of amusing incidents. Everybody was in high
glee; fortunes were supposedly within reach; everything was booming.
On the tops of the derricks floated flags on which strange mottoes
were displayed. I remember looking down toward the river and seeing
two men working their treadles boring for oil upon the banks of the
stream, and inscribed upon their flag was "Hell or China." They were
going down, no matter how far.

The adaptability of the American was never better displayed than in
this region. Order was soon evolved out of chaos. When we visited the
place not long after we were serenaded by a brass band the players of
which were made up of the new inhabitants along the creek. It would be
safe to wager that a thousand Americans in a new land would organize
themselves, establish schools, churches, newspapers, and brass
bands--in short, provide themselves with all the appliances of
civilization--and go ahead developing their country before an equal
number of British would have discovered who among them was the highest
in hereditary rank and had the best claims to leadership owing to his
grandfather. There is but one rule among Americans--the tools to those
who can use them.

To-day Oil Creek is a town of many thousand inhabitants, as is also
Titusville at the other end of the creek. The district which began by
furnishing a few barrels of oil every season, gathered with blankets
from the surface of the creek by the Seneca Indians, has now several
towns and refineries, with millions of dollars of capital. In those
early days all the arrangements were of the crudest character. When
the oil was obtained it was run into flat-bottomed boats which leaked
badly. Water ran into the boats and the oil overflowed into the river.
The creek was dammed at various places, and upon a stipulated day and
hour the dams were opened and upon the flood the oil boats floated to
the Allegheny River, and thence to Pittsburgh.

In this way not only the creek, but the Allegheny River, became
literally covered with oil. The loss involved in transportation to
Pittsburgh was estimated at fully a third of the total quantity, and
before the oil boats started it is safe to say that another third was
lost by leakage. The oil gathered by the Indians in the early days was
bottled in Pittsburgh and sold at high prices as medicine--a dollar
for a small vial. It had general reputation as a sure cure for
rheumatic tendencies. As it became plentiful and cheap its virtues
vanished. What fools we mortals be!

The most celebrated wells were upon the Storey farm. Upon these we
obtained an option of purchase for forty thousand dollars. We bought
them. Mr. Coleman, ever ready at suggestion, proposed to make a lake
of oil by excavating a pool sufficient to hold a hundred thousand
barrels (the waste to be made good every day by running streams of oil
into it), and to hold it for the not far distant day when, as we then
expected, the oil supply would cease. This was promptly acted upon,
but after losing many thousands of barrels waiting for the expected
day (which has not yet arrived) we abandoned the reserve. Coleman
predicted that when the supply stopped, oil would bring ten dollars a
barrel and therefore we would have a million dollars worth in the
lake. We did not think then of Nature's storehouse below which still
keeps on yielding many thousands of barrels per day without apparent
exhaustion.

This forty-thousand-dollar investment proved for us the best of all so
far. The revenues from it came at the most opportune time.[28] The
building of the new mill in Pittsburgh required not only all the
capital we could gather, but the use of our credit, which I consider,
looking backward, was remarkably good for young men.

[Footnote 28: The wells on the Storey farm paid in one year a million
dollars in cash and dividends, and the farm itself eventually became
worth, on a stock basis, five million dollars.]

Having become interested in this oil venture, I made several
excursions to the district and also, in 1864, to an oil field in Ohio
where a great well had been struck which yielded a peculiar quality of
oil well fitted for lubricating purposes. My journey thither with Mr.
Coleman and Mr. David Ritchie was one of the strangest experiences I
ever had. We left the railway line some hundreds of miles from
Pittsburgh and plunged through a sparsely inhabited district to the
waters of Duck Creek to see the monster well. We bought it before
leaving.

It was upon our return that adventures began. The weather had been
fine and the roads quite passable during our journey thither, but rain
had set in during our stay. We started back in our wagon, but before
going far fell into difficulties. The road had become a mass of soft,
tenacious mud and our wagon labored fearfully. The rain fell in
torrents, and it soon became evident that we were in for a night of
it. Mr. Coleman lay at full length on one side of the wagon, and Mr.
Ritchie on the other, and I, being then very thin, weighing not much
more than a hundred pounds, was nicely sandwiched between the two
portly gentlemen. Every now and then the wagon proceeded a few feet
heaving up and down in the most outrageous manner, and finally
sticking fast. In this fashion we passed the night. There was in front
a seat across the wagon, under which we got our heads, and in spite of
our condition the night was spent in uproarious merriment.

By the next night we succeeded in reaching a country town in the worst
possible plight. We saw the little frame church of the town lighted
and heard the bell ringing. We had just reached our tavern when a
committee appeared stating that they had been waiting for us and that
the congregation was assembled. It appears that a noted exhorter had
been expected who had no doubt been delayed as we had been. I was
taken for the absentee minister and asked how soon I would be ready to
accompany them to the meeting-house. I was almost prepared with my
companions to carry out the joke (we were in for fun), but I found I
was too exhausted with fatigue to attempt it. I had never before come
so near occupying a pulpit.

My investments now began to require so much of my personal attention
that I resolved to leave the service of the railway company and devote
myself exclusively to my own affairs. I had been honored a short time
before this decision by being called by President Thomson to
Philadelphia. He desired to promote me to the office of assistant
general superintendent with headquarters at Altoona under Mr. Lewis. I
declined, telling him that I had decided to give up the railroad
service altogether, that I was determined to make a fortune and I saw
no means of doing this honestly at any salary the railroad company
could afford to give, and I would not do it by indirection. When I lay
down at night I was going to get a verdict of approval from the
highest of all tribunals, the judge within.

I repeated this in my parting letter to President Thomson, who warmly
congratulated me upon it in his letter of reply. I resigned my
position March 28, 1865, and received from the men on the railway a
gold watch. This and Mr. Thomson's letter I treasure among my most
precious mementos.

The following letter was written to the men on the Division:

     PENNSYLVANIA RAILROAD COMPANY
     SUPERINTENDENT'S OFFICE, PITTSBURGH DIVISION
     PITTSBURGH, _March 28, 1865_

     To the Officers and Employees of the Pittsburgh Division

     GENTLEMEN:

     I cannot allow my connection with you to cease without some
     expression of the deep regret felt at parting.

     Twelve years of pleasant intercourse have served to inspire
     feelings of personal regard for those who have so faithfully
     labored with me in the service of the Company. The coming
     change is painful only as I reflect that in consequence
     thereof I am not to be in the future, as in the past,
     intimately associated with you and with many others in the
     various departments, who have through business intercourse,
     become my personal friends. I assure you although the
     official relations hitherto existing between us must soon
     close, I can never fail to feel and evince the liveliest
     interest in the welfare of such as have been identified with
     the Pittsburgh Division in times past, and who are, I trust,
     for many years to come to contribute to the success of the
     Pennsylvania Railroad Company, and share in its justly
     deserved prosperity.

     Thanking you most sincerely for the uniform kindness shown
     toward me, for your zealous efforts made at all times to
     meet my wishes, and asking for my successor similar support
     at your hands, I bid you all farewell.

     Very respectfully

     (Signed) ANDREW CARNEGIE

Thenceforth I never worked for a salary. A man must necessarily occupy
a narrow field who is at the beck and call of others. Even if he
becomes president of a great corporation he is hardly his own master,
unless he holds control of the stock. The ablest presidents are
hampered by boards of directors and shareholders, who can know but
little of the business. But I am glad to say that among my best
friends to-day are those with whom I labored in the service of the
Pennsylvania Railroad Company.

In the year 1867, Mr. Phipps, Mr. J.W. Vandevort, and myself revisited
Europe, traveling extensively through England and Scotland, and made
the tour of the Continent. "Vandy" had become my closest companion. We
had both been fired by reading Bayard Taylor's "Views Afoot." It was
in the days of the oil excitement and shares were going up like
rockets. One Sunday, lying in the grass, I said to "Vandy":

"If you could make three thousand dollars would you spend it in a tour
through Europe with me?"

"Would a duck swim or an Irishman eat potatoes?" was his reply.

The sum was soon made in oil stock by the investment of a few hundred
dollars which "Vandy" had saved. This was the beginning of our
excursion. We asked my partner, Harry Phipps, who was by this time
quite a capitalist, to join the party. We visited most of the capitals
of Europe, and in all the enthusiasm of youth climbed every spire,
slept on mountain-tops, and carried our luggage in knapsacks upon our
backs. We ended our journey upon Vesuvius, where we resolved some day
to go around the world.

This visit to Europe proved most instructive. Up to this time I had
known nothing of painting or sculpture, but it was not long before I
could classify the works of the great painters. One may not at the
time justly appreciate the advantage he is receiving from examining
the great masterpieces, but upon his return to America he will find
himself unconsciously rejecting what before seemed truly beautiful,
and judging productions which come before him by a new standard. That
which is truly great has so impressed itself upon him that what is
false or pretentious proves no longer attractive.

My visit to Europe also gave me my first great treat in music. The
Handel Anniversary was then being celebrated at the Crystal Palace in
London, and I had never up to that time, nor have I often since, felt
the power and majesty of music in such high degree. What I heard at
the Crystal Palace and what I subsequently heard on the Continent in
the cathedrals, and at the opera, certainly enlarged my appreciation
of music. At Rome the Pope's choir and the celebrations in the
churches at Christmas and Easter furnished, as it were, a grand climax
to the whole.

These visits to Europe were also of great service in a commercial
sense. One has to get out of the swirl of the great Republic to form a
just estimate of the velocity with which it spins. I felt that a
manufacturing concern like ours could scarcely develop fast enough for
the wants of the American people, but abroad nothing seemed to be
going forward. If we excepted a few of the capitals of Europe,
everything on the Continent seemed to be almost at a standstill, while
the Republic represented throughout its entire extent such a scene as
there must have been at the Tower of Babel, as pictured in the
story-books--hundreds rushing to and fro, each more active than his
neighbor, and all engaged in constructing the mighty edifice.

It was Cousin "Dod" (Mr. George Lauder) to whom we were indebted for a
new development in our mill operations--the first of its kind in
America. He it was who took our Mr. Coleman to Wigan in England and
explained the process of washing and coking the dross from coal mines.
Mr. Coleman had constantly been telling us how grand it would be to
utilize what was then being thrown away at our mines, and was indeed
an expense to dispose of. Our Cousin "Dod" was a mechanical engineer,
educated under Lord Kelvin at Glasgow University, and as he
corroborated all that Mr. Coleman stated, in December, 1871, I
undertook to advance the capital to build works along the line of the
Pennsylvania Railroad. Contracts for ten years were made with the
leading coal companies for their dross and with the railway companies
for transportation, and Mr. Lauder, who came to Pittsburgh and
superintended the whole operation for years, began the construction of
the first coal-washing machinery in America. He made a success of
it--he never failed to do that in any mining or mechanical operation
he undertook--and he soon cleared the cost of the works. No wonder
that at a later date my partners desired to embrace the coke works in
our general firm and thus capture not only these, but Lauder also.
"Dod" had won his spurs.

[Illustration: GEORGE LAUDER]

The ovens were extended from time to time until we had five hundred of
them, washing nearly fifteen hundred tons of coal daily. I confess I
never pass these coal ovens at Larimer's Station without feeling that
if he who makes two blades of grass grow where one grew before is a
public benefactor and lays the race under obligation, those who
produce superior coke from material that has been for all previous
years thrown over the bank as worthless, have great cause for
self-congratulation. It is fine to make something out of nothing; it
is also something to be the first firm to do this upon our continent.

We had another valuable partner in a second cousin of mine, a son of
Cousin Morrison of Dunfermline. Walking through the shops one day, the
superintendent asked me if I knew I had a relative there who was
proving an exceptional mechanic. I replied in the negative and asked
that I might speak with him on our way around. We met. I asked his
name.

"Morrison," was the reply, "son of Robert"--my cousin Bob.

"Well, how did you come here?"

"I thought we could better ourselves," he said.

"Who have you with you?"

"My wife," was the reply.

"Why didn't you come first to see your relative who might have been
able to introduce you here?"

"Well, I didn't feel I needed help if I only got a chance."

There spoke the true Morrison, taught to depend on himself, and
independent as Lucifer. Not long afterwards I heard of his promotion
to the superintendency of our newly acquired works at Duquesne, and
from that position he steadily marched upward. He is to-day a
blooming, but still sensible, millionaire. We are all proud of Tom
Morrison. [A note received from him yesterday invites Mrs. Carnegie
and myself to be his guests during our coming visit of a few days at
the annual celebration of the Carnegie Institute.]

I was always advising that our iron works should be extended and new
developments made in connection with the manufacture of iron and
steel, which I saw was only in its infancy. All apprehension of its
future development was dispelled by the action of America with regard
to the tariff upon foreign imports. It was clear to my mind that the
Civil War had resulted in a fixed determination upon the part of the
American people to build a nation within itself, independent of Europe
in all things essential to its safety. America had been obliged to
import all her steel of every form and most of the iron needed,
Britain being the chief seller. The people demanded a home supply and
Congress granted the manufacturers a tariff of twenty-eight per cent
_ad valorem_ on steel rails--the tariff then being equal to about
twenty-eight dollars per ton. Rails were selling at about a hundred
dollars per ton, and other rates in proportion.

Protection has played a great part in the development of manufacturing
in the United States. Previous to the Civil War it was a party
question, the South standing for free trade and regarding a tariff as
favorable only to the North. The sympathy shown by the British
Government for the Confederacy, culminating in the escape of the
Alabama and other privateers to prey upon American commerce, aroused
hostility against that Government, notwithstanding the majority of her
common people favored the United States. The tariff became no longer a
party question, but a national policy, approved by both parties. It
had become a patriotic duty to develop vital resources. No less than
ninety Northern Democrats in Congress, including the Speaker of the
House, agreed upon that point.

Capital no longer hesitated to embark in manufacturing, confident as
it was that the nation would protect it as long as necessary. Years
after the war, demands for a reduction of the tariff arose and it was
my lot to be drawn into the controversy. It was often charged that
bribery of Congressmen by manufacturers was common. So far as I know
there was no foundation for this. Certainly the manufacturers never
raised any sums beyond those needed to maintain the Iron and Steel
Association, a matter of a few thousand dollars per year. They did,
however, subscribe freely to a campaign when the issue was Protection
_versus_ Free Trade.

The duties upon steel were successively reduced, with my cordial
support, until the twenty-eight dollars duty on rails became only one
fourth or seven dollars per ton. [To-day (1911) the duty is only about
one half of that, and even that should go in the next revision.] The
effort of President Cleveland to pass a more drastic new tariff was
interesting. It cut too deep in many places and its passage would have
injured more than one manufacture. I was called to Washington, and
tried to modify and, as I believe, improve, the Wilson Bill. Senator
Gorman, Democratic leader of the Senate, Governor Flower of New York,
and a number of the ablest Democrats were as sound protectionists in
moderation as I was. Several of these were disposed to oppose the
Wilson Bill as being unnecessarily severe and certain to cripple some
of our domestic industries. Senator Gorman said to me he wished as
little as I did to injure any home producer, and he thought his
colleagues had confidence in and would be guided by me as to iron and
steel rates, provided that large reductions were made and that the
Republican Senators would stand unitedly for a bill of that character.
I remember his words, "I can afford to fight the President and beat
him, but I can't afford to fight him and be beaten."

Governor Flower shared these views. There was little trouble in
getting our party to agree to the large reductions I proposed. The
Wilson-Gorman Tariff Bill was adopted. Meeting Senator Gorman later,
he explained that he had to give way on cotton ties to secure several
Southern Senators. Cotton ties had to be free. So tariff legislation
goes.

I was not sufficiently prominent in manufacturing to take part in
getting the tariff established immediately after the war, so it
happened that my part has always been to favor reduction of duties,
opposing extremes--the unreasonable protectionists who consider the
higher the duties the better and declaim against any reduction, and
the other extremists who denounce all duties and would adopt
unrestrained free trade.

We could now (1907) abolish all duties upon steel and iron without
injury, essential as these duties were at the beginning. Europe has
not much surplus production, so that should prices rise exorbitantly
here only a small amount could be drawn from there and this would
instantly raise prices in Europe, so that our home manufacturers could
not be seriously affected. Free trade would only tend to prevent
exorbitant prices here for a time when the demand was excessive. Home
iron and steel manufacturers have nothing to fear from free trade. [I
recently (1910) stated this in evidence before the Tariff Commission
at Washington.]




CHAPTER XI

NEW YORK AS HEADQUARTERS


Our business continued to expand and required frequent visits on my
part to the East, especially to New York, which is as London to
Britain--the headquarters of all really important enterprises in
America. No large concern could very well get on without being
represented there. My brother and Mr. Phipps had full grasp of the
business at Pittsburgh. My field appeared to be to direct the general
policy of the companies and negotiate the important contracts.

My brother had been so fortunate as to marry Miss Lucy Coleman,
daughter of one of our most valued partners and friends. Our family
residence at Homewood was given over to him, and I was once more
compelled to break old associations and leave Pittsburgh in 1867 to
take up my residence in New York. The change was hard enough for me,
but much harder for my mother; but she was still in the prime of life
and we could be happy anywhere so long as we were together. Still she
did feel the leaving of our home very much. We were perfect strangers
in New York, and at first took up our quarters in the St. Nicholas
Hotel, then in its glory. I opened an office in Broad Street.

For some time the Pittsburgh friends who came to New York were our
chief source of happiness, and the Pittsburgh papers seemed necessary
to our existence. I made frequent visits there and my mother often
accompanied me, so that our connection with the old home was still
maintained. But after a time new friendships were formed and new
interests awakened and New York began to be called home. When the
proprietors of the St. Nicholas opened the Windsor Hotel uptown, we
took up our residence there and up to the year 1887 that was our New
York home. Mr. Hawk, the proprietor, became one of our valued friends
and his nephew and namesake still remains so.

Among the educative influences from which I derived great advantage in
New York, none ranks higher than the Nineteenth Century Club organized
by Mr. and Mrs. Courtlandt Palmer. The club met at their house once a
month for the discussion of various topics and soon attracted many
able men and women. It was to Madame Botta I owed my election to
membership--a remarkable woman, wife of Professor Botta, whose
drawing-room became more of a salon than any in the city, if indeed it
were not the only one resembling a salon at that time. I was honored
by an invitation one day to dine at the Bottas' and there met for the
first time several distinguished people, among them one who became my
lifelong friend and wise counselor, Andrew D. White, then president of
Cornell University, afterwards Ambassador to Russia and Germany, and
our chief delegate to the Hague Conference.

Here in the Nineteenth Century Club was an arena, indeed. Able men and
women discussed the leading topics of the day in due form, addressing
the audience one after another. The gatherings soon became too large
for a private room. The monthly meetings were then held in the
American Art Galleries. I remember the first evening I took part as
one of the speakers the subject was "The Aristocracy of the Dollar."
Colonel Thomas Wentworth Higginson was the first speaker. This was my
introduction to a New York audience. Thereafter I spoke now and then.
It was excellent training, for one had to read and study for each
appearance.

I had lived long enough in Pittsburgh to acquire the manufacturing, as
distinguished from the speculative, spirit. My knowledge of affairs,
derived from my position as telegraph operator, had enabled me to know
the few Pittsburgh men or firms which then had dealings upon the New
York Stock Exchange, and I watched their careers with deep interest.
To me their operations seemed simply a species of gambling. I did not
then know that the credit of all these men or firms was seriously
impaired by the knowledge (which it is almost impossible to conceal)
that they were given to speculation. But the firms were then so few
that I could have counted them on the fingers of one hand. The Oil and
Stock Exchanges in Pittsburgh had not as yet been founded and brokers'
offices with wires in connection with the stock exchanges of the East
were unnecessary. Pittsburgh was emphatically a manufacturing town.

I was surprised to find how very different was the state of affairs in
New York. There were few even of the business men who had not their
ventures in Wall Street to a greater or less extent. I was besieged
with inquiries from all quarters in regard to the various railway
enterprises with which I was connected. Offers were made to me by
persons who were willing to furnish capital for investment and allow
me to manage it--the supposition being that from the inside view which
I was enabled to obtain I could invest for them successfully.
Invitations were extended to me to join parties who intended quietly
to buy up the control of certain properties. In fact the whole
speculative field was laid out before me in its most seductive guise.

All these allurements I declined. The most notable offer of this kind
I ever received was one morning in the Windsor Hotel soon after my
removal to New York. Jay Gould, then in the height of his career,
approached me and said he had heard of me and he would purchase
control of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company and give me one half of
all profits if I would agree to devote myself to its management. I
thanked him and said that, although Mr. Scott and I had parted company
in business matters, I would never raise my hand against him.
Subsequently Mr. Scott told me he had heard I had been selected by New
York interests to succeed him. I do not know how he had learned this,
as I had never mentioned it. I was able to reassure him by saying that
the only railroad company I would be president of would be one I
owned.

Strange what changes the whirligig of time brings in. It was my part
one morning in 1900, some thirty years afterwards, to tell the son of
Mr. Gould of his father's offer and to say to him:

"Your father offered me control of the great Pennsylvania system. Now
I offer his son in return the control of an international line from
ocean to ocean."

The son and I agreed upon the first step--that was the bringing of his
Wabash line to Pittsburgh. This was successfully done under a contract
given the Wabash of one third of the traffic of our steel company. We
were about to take up the eastern extension from Pittsburgh to the
Atlantic when Mr. Morgan approached me in March, 1901, through Mr.
Schwab, and asked if I really wished to retire from business. I
answered in the affirmative and that put an end to our railway
operations.

I have never bought or sold a share of stock speculatively in my life,
except one small lot of Pennsylvania Railroad shares that I bought
early in life for investment and for which I did not pay at the time
because bankers offered to carry it for me at a low rate. I have
adhered to the rule never to purchase what I did not pay for, and
never to sell what I did not own. In those early days, however, I had
several interests that were taken over in the course of business. They
included some stocks and securities that were quoted on the New York
Stock Exchange, and I found that when I opened my paper in the morning
I was tempted to look first at the quotations of the stock market. As
I had determined to sell all my interests in every outside concern and
concentrate my attention upon our manufacturing concerns in
Pittsburgh, I further resolved not even to own any stock that was
bought and sold upon any stock exchange. With the exception of
trifling amounts which came to me in various ways I have adhered
strictly to this rule.

Such a course should commend itself to every man in the manufacturing
business and to all professional men. For the manufacturing man
especially the rule would seem all-important. His mind must be kept
calm and free if he is to decide wisely the problems which are
continually coming before him. Nothing tells in the long run like good
judgment, and no sound judgment can remain with the man whose mind is
disturbed by the mercurial changes of the Stock Exchange. It places
him under an influence akin to intoxication. What is not, he sees, and
what he sees, is not. He cannot judge of relative values or get the
true perspective of things. The molehill seems to him a mountain and
the mountain a molehill, and he jumps at conclusions which he should
arrive at by reason. His mind is upon the stock quotations and not
upon the points that require calm thought. Speculation is a parasite
feeding upon values, creating none.

My first important enterprise after settling in New York was
undertaking to build a bridge across the Mississippi at Keokuk.[29]
Mr. Thomson, president of the Pennsylvania Railroad, and I contracted
for the whole structure, foundation, masonry, and superstructure,
taking bonds and stocks in payment. The undertaking was a splendid
success in every respect, except financially. A panic threw the
connecting railways into bankruptcy. They were unable to pay the
stipulated sums. Rival systems built a bridge across the Mississippi
at Burlington and a railway down the west side of the Mississippi to
Keokuk. The handsome profits which we saw in prospect were never
realized. Mr. Thomson and myself, however, escaped loss, although
there was little margin left.

[Footnote 29: It was an iron bridge 2300 feet in length with a
380-foot span.]

The superstructure for this bridge was built at our Keystone Works in
Pittsburgh. The undertaking required me to visit Keokuk occasionally,
and there I made the acquaintance of clever and delightful people,
among them General and Mrs. Reid, and Mr. and Mrs. Leighton. Visiting
Keokuk with some English friends at a later date, the impression they
received of society in the Far West, on what to them seemed the very
outskirts of civilization, was surprising. A reception given to us one
evening by General Reid brought together an assembly creditable to any
town in Britain. More than one of the guests had distinguished himself
during the war and had risen to prominence in the national councils.

The reputation obtained in the building of the Keokuk bridge led to my
being applied to by those who were in charge of the scheme for
bridging the Mississippi at St. Louis, to which I have already
referred. This was connected with my first large financial
transaction. One day in 1869 the gentleman in charge of the
enterprise, Mr. Macpherson (he was very Scotch), called at my New York
office and said they were trying to raise capital to build the bridge.
He wished to know if I could not enlist some of the Eastern railroad
companies in the scheme. After careful examination of the project I
made the contract for the construction of the bridge on behalf of the
Keystone Bridge Works. I also obtained an option upon four million
dollars of first mortgage bonds of the bridge company and set out for
London in March, 1869, to negotiate their sale.

During the voyage I prepared a prospectus which I had printed upon my
arrival in London, and, having upon my previous visit made the
acquaintance of Junius S. Morgan, the great banker, I called upon him
one morning and opened negotiations. I left with him a copy of the
prospectus, and upon calling next day was delighted to find that Mr.
Morgan viewed the matter favorably. I sold him part of the bonds with
the option to take the remainder; but when his lawyers were called in
for advice a score of changes were required in the wording of the
bonds. Mr. Morgan said to me that as I was going to Scotland I had
better go now; I could write the parties in St. Louis and ascertain
whether they would agree to the changes proposed. It would be time
enough, he said, to close the matter upon my return three weeks hence.

But I had no idea of allowing the fish to play so long, and informed
him that I would have a telegram in the morning agreeing to all the
changes. The Atlantic cable had been open for some time, but it is
doubtful if it had yet carried so long a private cable as I sent that
day. It was an easy matter to number the lines of the bond and then
going carefully over them to state what changes, omissions, or
additions were required in each line. I showed Mr. Morgan the message
before sending it and he said:

"Well, young man, if you succeed in that you deserve a red mark."

When I entered the office next morning, I found on the desk that had
been appropriated to my use in Mr. Morgan's private office the colored
envelope which contained the answer. There it was: "Board meeting last
night; changes all approved." "Now, Mr. Morgan," I said, "we can
proceed, assuming that the bond is as your lawyers desire." The papers
were soon closed.

[Illustration: JUNIUS SPENCER MORGAN]

While I was in the office Mr. Sampson, the financial editor of "The
Times," came in. I had an interview with him, well knowing that a few
words from him would go far in lifting the price of the bonds on the
Exchange. American securities had recently been fiercely attacked,
owing to the proceedings of Fisk and Gould in connection with the Erie
Railway Company, and their control of the judges in New York, who
seemed to do their bidding. I knew this would be handed out as an
objection, and therefore I met it at once. I called Mr. Sampson's
attention to the fact that the charter of the St. Louis Bridge Company
was from the National Government. In case of necessity appeal lay
directly to the Supreme Court of the United States, a body vying with
their own high tribunals. He said he would be delighted to give
prominence to this commendable feature. I described the bridge as a
toll-gate on the continental highway and this appeared to please him.
It was all plain and easy sailing, and when he left the office, Mr.
Morgan clapped me on the shoulder and said:

"Thank you, young man; you have raised the price of those bonds five
per cent this morning."

"All right, Mr. Morgan," I replied; "now show me how I can raise them
five per cent more for you."

The issue was a great success, and the money for the St. Louis Bridge
was obtained. I had a considerable margin of profit upon the
negotiation. This was my first financial negotiation with the bankers
of Europe. Mr. Pullman told me a few days later that Mr. Morgan at a
dinner party had told the telegraphic incident and predicted, "That
young man will be heard from."

After closing with Mr. Morgan, I visited my native town, Dunfermline,
and at that time made the town a gift of public baths. It is notable
largely because it was the first considerable gift I had ever made.
Long before that I had, at my Uncle Lauder's suggestion, sent a
subscription to the fund for the Wallace Monument on Stirling Heights
overlooking Bannockburn. It was not much, but I was then in the
telegraph office and it was considerable out of a revenue of thirty
dollars per month with family expenses staring us in the face. Mother
did not grudge it; on the contrary, she was a very proud woman that
her son's name was seen on the list of contributors, and her son felt
he was really beginning to be something of a man. Years afterward my
mother and I visited Stirling, and there unveiled, in the Wallace
Tower, a bust of Sir Walter Scott, which she had presented to the
monument committee. We had then made great progress, at least
financially, since the early subscription. But distribution had not
yet begun.[30] So far with me it had been the age of accumulation.

[Footnote 30: The ambitions of Mr. Carnegie at this time (1868) are
set forth in the following memorandum made by him. It has only
recently come to light:

_St. Nicholas Hotel, New York, December, 1868_

Thirty-three and an income of $50,000 per annum! By this time two
years I can so arrange all my business as to secure at least $50,000
per annum. Beyond this never earn--make no effort to increase fortune,
but spend the surplus each year for benevolent purposes. Cast aside
business forever, except for others.

Settle in Oxford and get a thorough education, making the acquaintance
of literary men--this will take three years' active work--pay especial
attention to speaking in public. Settle then in London and purchase a
controlling interest in some newspaper or live review and give the
general management of it attention, taking a part in public matters,
especially those connected with education and improvement of the
poorer classes.

Man must have an idol--the amassing of wealth is one of the worst
species of idolatry--no idol more debasing than the worship of money.
Whatever I engage in I must push inordinately; therefore should I be
careful to choose that life which will be the most elevating in its
character. To continue much longer overwhelmed by business cares and
with most of my thoughts wholly upon the way to make more money in the
shortest time, must degrade me beyond hope of permanent recovery. I
will resign business at thirty-five, but during the ensuing two years
I wish to spend the afternoons in receiving instruction and in reading
systematically.]

While visiting the Continent of Europe in 1867 and deeply interested
in what I saw, it must not be thought that my mind was not upon
affairs at home. Frequent letters kept me advised of business matters.
The question of railway communication with the Pacific had been
brought to the front by the Civil War, and Congress had passed an act
to encourage the construction of a line. The first sod had just been
cut at Omaha and it was intended that the line should ultimately be
pushed through to San Francisco. One day while in Rome it struck me
that this might be done much sooner than was then anticipated. The
nation, having made up its mind that its territory must be bound
together, might be trusted to see that no time was lost in
accomplishing it. I wrote my friend Mr. Scott, suggesting that we
should obtain the contract to place sleeping-cars upon the great
California line. His reply contained these words:

"Well, young man, you do take time by the forelock."

Nevertheless, upon my return to America. I pursued the idea. The
sleeping-car business, in which I was interested, had gone on
increasing so rapidly that it was impossible to obtain cars enough to
supply the demand. This very fact led to the forming of the present
Pullman Company. The Central Transportation Company was simply unable
to cover the territory with sufficient rapidity, and Mr. Pullman
beginning at the greatest of all railway centers in the
world--Chicago--soon rivaled the parent concern. He had also seen that
the Pacific Railroad would be the great sleeping-car line of the
world, and I found him working for what I had started after. He was,
indeed, a lion in the path. Again, one may learn, from an incident
which I had from Mr. Pullman himself, by what trifles important
matters are sometimes determined.

The president of the Union Pacific Railway was passing through
Chicago. Mr. Pullman called upon him and was shown into his room.
Lying upon the table was a telegram addressed to Mr. Scott, saying,
"Your proposition for sleeping-cars is accepted." Mr. Pullman read
this involuntarily and before he had time to refrain. He could not
help seeing it where it lay. When President Durrant entered the room
he explained this to him and said:

"I trust you will not decide this matter until I have made a
proposition to you."

Mr. Durrant promised to wait. A meeting of the board of directors of
the Union Pacific Company was held soon after this in New York. Mr.
Pullman and myself were in attendance, both striving to obtain the
prize which neither he nor I undervalued. One evening we began to
mount the broad staircase in the St. Nicholas Hotel at the same time.
We had met before, but were not well acquainted. I said, however, as
we walked up the stairs:

"Good-evening, Mr. Pullman! Here we are together, and are we not
making a nice couple of fools of ourselves?" He was not disposed to
admit anything and said:

"What do you mean?"

I explained the situation to him. We were destroying by our rival
propositions the very advantages we desired to obtain.

"Well," he said, "what do you propose to do about it?"

"Unite," I said. "Make a joint proposition to the Union Pacific, your
party and mine, and organize a company."

"What would you call it?" he asked.

"The Pullman Palace Car Company," I replied.

This suited him exactly; and it suited me equally well.

"Come into my room and talk it over," said the great sleeping-car man.

I did so, and the result was that we obtained the contract jointly.
Our company was subsequently merged in the general Pullman Company and
we took stock in that company for our Pacific interests. Until
compelled to sell my shares during the subsequent financial panic of
1873 to protect our iron and steel interests, I was, I believe, the
largest shareholder in the Pullman Company.

This man Pullman and his career are so thoroughly American that a few
words about him will not be out of place. Mr. Pullman was at first a
working carpenter, but when Chicago had to be elevated he took a
contract on his own account to move or elevate houses for a
stipulated sum. Of course he was successful, and from this small
beginning he became one of the principal and best-known contractors in
that line. If a great hotel was to be raised ten feet without
disturbing its hundreds of guests or interfering in any way with its
business, Mr. Pullman was the man. He was one of those rare characters
who can see the drift of things, and was always to be found, so to
speak, swimming in the main current where movement was the fastest. He
soon saw, as I did, that the sleeping-car was a positive necessity
upon the American continent. He began to construct a few cars at
Chicago and to obtain contracts upon the lines centering there.

The Eastern concern was in no condition to cope with that of an
extraordinary man like Mr. Pullman. I soon recognized this, and
although the original patents were with the Eastern company and Mr.
Woodruff himself, the original patentee, was a large shareholder, and
although we might have obtained damages for infringement of patent
after some years of litigation, yet the time lost before this could be
done would have been sufficient to make Pullman's the great company of
the country. I therefore earnestly advocated that we should unite with
Mr. Pullman, as I had united with him before in the Union Pacific
contract. As the personal relations between Mr. Pullman and some
members of the Eastern company were unsatisfactory, it was deemed best
that I should undertake the negotiations, being upon friendly footing
with both parties. We soon agreed that the Pullman Company should
absorb our company, the Central Transportation Company, and by this
means Mr. Pullman, instead of being confined to the West, obtained
control of the rights on the great Pennsylvania trunk line to the
Atlantic seaboard. This placed his company beyond all possible rivals.
Mr. Pullman was one of the ablest men of affairs I have ever known,
and I am indebted to him, among other things, for one story which
carried a moral.

Mr. Pullman, like every other man, had his difficulties and
disappointments, and did not hit the mark every time. No one does.
Indeed, I do not know any one but himself who could have surmounted
the difficulties surrounding the business of running sleeping-cars in
a satisfactory manner and still retained some rights which the railway
companies were bound to respect. Railway companies should, of course,
operate their own sleeping-cars. On one occasion when we were
comparing notes he told me that he always found comfort in this story.
An old man in a Western county having suffered from all the ills that
flesh is heir to, and a great many more than it usually encounters,
and being commiserated by his neighbors, replied:

"Yes, my friends, all that you say is true. I have had a long, long
life full of troubles, but there is one curious fact about them--nine
tenths of them never happened."

True indeed; most of the troubles of humanity are imaginary and should
be laughed out of court. It is folly to cross a bridge until you come
to it, or to bid the Devil good-morning until you meet him--perfect
folly. All is well until the stroke falls, and even then nine times
out of ten it is not so bad as anticipated. A wise man is the
confirmed optimist.

Success in these various negotiations had brought me into some notice
in New York, and my next large operation was in connection with the
Union Pacific Railway in 1871. One of its directors came to me saying
that they must raise in some way a sum of six hundred thousand dollars
(equal to many millions to-day) to carry them through a crisis; and
some friends who knew me and were on the executive committee of that
road had suggested that I might be able to obtain the money and at the
same time get for the Pennsylvania Railroad Company virtual control of
that important Western line. I believe Mr. Pullman came with the
director, or perhaps it was Mr. Pullman himself who first came to me
on the subject.

I took up the matter, and it occurred to me that if the directors of
the Union Pacific Railway would be willing to elect to its board of
directors a few such men as the Pennsylvania Railroad would nominate,
the traffic to be thus obtained for the Pennsylvania would justify
that company in helping the Union Pacific. I went to Philadelphia and
laid the subject before President Thomson. I suggested that if the
Pennsylvania Railroad Company would trust me with securities upon
which the Union Pacific could borrow money in New York, we could
control the Union Pacific in the interests of the Pennsylvania. Among
many marks of Mr. Thomson's confidence this was up to that time the
greatest. He was much more conservative when handling the money of the
railroad company than his own, but the prize offered was too great to
be missed. Even if the six hundred thousand dollars had been lost, it
would not have been a losing investment for his company, and there was
little danger of this because we were ready to hand over to him the
securities which we obtained in return for the loan to the Union
Pacific.

My interview with Mr. Thomson took place at his house in Philadelphia,
and as I rose to go he laid his hand upon my shoulder, saying:

"Remember, Andy, I look to you in this matter. It is you I trust, and
I depend on your holding all the securities you obtain and seeing
that the Pennsylvania Railroad is never in a position where it can
lose a dollar."

I accepted the responsibility, and the result was a triumphant
success. The Union Pacific Company was exceedingly anxious that Mr.
Thomson himself should take the presidency, but this he said was out
of the question. He nominated Mr. Thomas A. Scott, vice-president of
the Pennsylvania Railroad, for the position. Mr. Scott, Mr. Pullman,
and myself were accordingly elected directors of the Union Pacific
Railway Company in 1871.

The securities obtained for the loan consisted of three millions of
the shares of the Union Pacific, which were locked in my safe, with
the option of taking them at a price. As was to be expected, the
accession of the Pennsylvania Railroad party rendered the stock of the
Union Pacific infinitely more valuable. The shares advanced
enormously. At this time I undertook to negotiate bonds in London for
a bridge to cross the Missouri at Omaha, and while I was absent upon
this business Mr. Scott decided to sell our Union Pacific shares. I
had left instructions with my secretary that Mr. Scott, as one of the
partners in the venture, should have access to the vault, as it might
be necessary in my absence that the securities should be within reach
of some one; but the idea that these should be sold, or that our party
should lose the splendid position we had acquired in connection with
the Union Pacific, never entered my brain.

I returned to find that, instead of being a trusted colleague of the
Union Pacific directors, I was regarded as having used them for
speculative purposes. No quartet of men ever had a finer opportunity
for identifying themselves with a great work than we had; and never
was an opportunity more recklessly thrown away. Mr. Pullman was
ignorant of the matter and as indignant as myself, and I believe that
he at once re-invested his profits in the shares of the Union Pacific.
I felt that much as I wished to do this and to repudiate what had been
done, it would be unbecoming and perhaps ungrateful in me to separate
myself so distinctly from my first of friends, Mr. Scott.

At the first opportunity we were ignominiously but deservedly expelled
from the Union Pacific board. It was a bitter dose for a young man to
swallow. And the transaction marked my first serious difference with a
man who up to that time had the greatest influence with me, the kind
and affectionate employer of my boyhood, Thomas A. Scott. Mr. Thomson
regretted the matter, but, as he said, having paid no attention to it
and having left the whole control of it in the hands of Mr. Scott and
myself, he presumed that I had thought best to sell out. For a time I
feared I had lost a valued friend in Levi P. Morton, of Morton, Bliss
& Co., who was interested in Union Pacific, but at last he found out
that I was innocent.

The negotiations concerning two and a half millions of bonds for the
construction of the Omaha Bridge were successful, and as these bonds
had been purchased by persons connected with the Union Pacific before
I had anything to do with the company, it was for them and not for the
Union Pacific Company that the negotiations were conducted. This was
not explained to me by the director who talked with me before I left
for London. Unfortunately, when I returned to New York I found that
the entire proceeds of the bonds, including my profit, had been
appropriated by the parties to pay their own debts, and I was thus
beaten out of a handsome sum, and had to credit to profit and loss my
expenses and time. I had never before been cheated and found it out so
positively and so clearly. I saw that I was still young and had a good
deal to learn. Many men can be trusted, but a few need watching.




CHAPTER XII

BUSINESS NEGOTIATIONS


Complete success attended a negotiation which I conducted about this
time for Colonel William Phillips, president of the Allegheny Valley
Railway at Pittsburgh. One day the Colonel entered my New York office
and told me that he needed money badly, but that he could get no house
in America to entertain the idea of purchasing five millions of bonds
of his company although they were to be guaranteed by the Pennsylvania
Railroad Company. The old gentleman felt sure that he was being driven
from pillar to post by the bankers because they had agreed among
themselves to purchase the bonds only upon their own terms. He asked
ninety cents on the dollar for them, but this the bankers considered
preposterously high. Those were the days when Western railway bonds
were often sold to the bankers at eighty cents on the dollar.

Colonel Phillips said he had come to see whether I could not suggest
some way out of his difficulty. He had pressing need for two hundred
and fifty thousand dollars, and this Mr. Thomson, of the Pennsylvania
Railroad, could not give him. The Allegheny bonds were seven per
cents, but they were payable, not in gold, but in currency, in
America. They were therefore wholly unsuited for the foreign market.
But I knew that the Pennsylvania Railroad Company had a large amount
of Philadelphia and Erie Railroad six per cent gold bonds in its
treasury. It would be a most desirable exchange on its part, I
thought, to give these bonds for the seven per cent Allegheny bonds
which bore its guarantee.

I telegraphed Mr. Thomson, asking if the Pennsylvania Railroad Company
would take two hundred and fifty thousand dollars at interest and lend
it to the Allegheny Railway Company. Mr. Thomson replied, "Certainly."
Colonel Phillips was happy. He agreed, in consideration of my
services, to give me a sixty-days option to take his five millions of
bonds at the desired ninety cents on the dollar. I laid the matter
before Mr. Thomson and suggested an exchange, which that company was
only too glad to make, as it saved one per cent interest on the bonds.
I sailed at once for London with the control of five millions of first
mortgage Philadelphia and Erie Bonds, guaranteed by the Pennsylvania
Railroad Company--a magnificent security for which I wanted a high
price. And here comes in one of the greatest of the hits and misses of
my financial life.

I wrote the Barings from Queenstown that I had for sale a security
which even their house might unhesitatingly consider. On my arrival in
London I found at the hotel a note from them requesting me to call. I
did so the next morning, and before I had left their banking house I
had closed an agreement by which they were to bring out this loan, and
that until they sold the bonds at par, less their two and a half per
cent commission, they would advance the Pennsylvania Railroad Company
four millions of dollars at five per cent interest. The sale left me a
clear profit of more than half a million dollars.

The papers were ordered to be drawn up, but as I was leaving Mr.
Russell Sturgis said they had just heard that Mr. Baring himself was
coming up to town in the morning. They had arranged to hold a
"court," and as it would be fitting to lay the transaction before him
as a matter of courtesy they would postpone the signing of the papers
until the morrow. If I would call at two o'clock the transaction would
be closed.

Never shall I forget the oppressed feeling which overcame me as I
stepped out and proceeded to the telegraph office to wire President
Thomson. Something told me that I ought not to do so. I would wait
till to-morrow when I had the contract in my pocket. I walked from the
banking house to the Langham Hotel--four long miles. When I reached
there I found a messenger waiting breathless to hand me a sealed note
from the Barings. Bismarck had locked up a hundred millions in
Magdeburg. The financial world was panic-stricken, and the Barings
begged to say that under the circumstances they could not propose to
Mr. Baring to go on with the matter. There was as much chance that I
should be struck by lightning on my way home as that an arrangement
agreed to by the Barings should be broken. And yet it was. It was too
great a blow to produce anything like irritation or indignation. I was
meek enough to be quite resigned, and merely congratulated myself that
I had not telegraphed Mr. Thomson.

I decided not to return to the Barings, and although J.S. Morgan & Co.
had been bringing out a great many American securities I subsequently
sold the bonds to them at a reduced price as compared with that agreed
to by the Barings. I thought it best not to go to Morgan & Co. at
first, because I had understood from Colonel Phillips that the bonds
had been unsuccessfully offered by him to their house in America and I
supposed that the Morgans in London might consider themselves
connected with the negotiations through their house in New York. But
in all subsequent negotiations I made it a rule to give the first
offer to Junius S. Morgan, who seldom permitted me to leave his
banking house without taking what I had to offer. If he could not buy
for his own house, he placed me in communication with a friendly house
that did, he taking an interest in the issue. It is a great
satisfaction to reflect that I never negotiated a security which did
not to the end command a premium. Of course in this case I made a
mistake in not returning to the Barings, giving them time and letting
the panic subside, which it soon did. When one party to a bargain
becomes excited, the other should keep cool and patient.

As an incident of my financial operations I remember saying to Mr.
Morgan one day:

"Mr. Morgan, I will give you an idea and help you to carry it forward
if you will give me one quarter of all the money you make by acting
upon it."

He laughingly said: "That seems fair, and as I have the option to act
upon it, or not, certainly we ought to be willing to pay you a quarter
of the profit."

I called attention to the fact that the Allegheny Valley Railway bonds
which I had exchanged for the Philadelphia and Erie bonds bore the
guarantee of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, and that that great
company was always in need of money for essential extensions. A price
might be offered for these bonds which might tempt the company to sell
them, and that at the moment there appeared to be such a demand for
American securities that no doubt they could be floated. I would write
a prospectus which I thought would float the bonds. After examining
the matter with his usual care he decided that he would act upon my
suggestion.

Mr. Thomson was then in Paris and I ran over there to see him. Knowing
that the Pennsylvania Railroad had need for money I told him that I
had recommended these securities to Mr. Morgan and if he would give me
a price for them I would see if I could not sell them. He named a
price which was then very high, but less than the price which these
bonds have since reached. Mr. Morgan purchased part of them with the
right to buy others, and in this way the whole nine or ten millions of
Allegheny bonds were marketed and the Pennsylvania Railroad Company
placed in funds.

The sale of the bonds had not gone very far when the panic of 1873 was
upon us. One of the sources of revenue which I then had was Mr.
Pierpont Morgan. He said to me one day:

"My father has cabled to ask whether you wish to sell out your
interest in that idea you gave him."

I said: "Yes, I do. In these days I will sell anything for money."

"Well," he said, "what would you take?"

I said I believed that a statement recently rendered to me showed that
there were already fifty thousand dollars to my credit, and I would
take sixty thousand. Next morning when I called Mr. Morgan handed me
checks for seventy thousand dollars.

"Mr. Carnegie," he said, "you were mistaken. You sold out for ten
thousand dollars less than the statement showed to your credit. It now
shows not fifty but sixty thousand to your credit, and the additional
ten makes seventy."

The payments were in two checks, one for sixty thousand dollars and
the other for the additional ten thousand. I handed him back the
ten-thousand-dollar check, saying:

"Well, that is something worthy of you. Will you please accept these
ten thousand with my best wishes?"

"No, thank you," he said, "I cannot do that."

Such acts, showing a nice sense of honorable understanding as against
mere legal rights, are not so uncommon in business as the uninitiated
might believe. And, after that, it is not to be wondered at if I
determined that so far as lay in my power neither Morgan, father or
son, nor their house, should suffer through me. They had in me
henceforth a firm friend.

[Illustration: JOHN PIERPONT MORGAN]

A great business is seldom if ever built up, except on lines of the
strictest integrity. A reputation for "cuteness" and sharp dealing is
fatal in great affairs. Not the letter of the law, but the spirit,
must be the rule. The standard of commercial morality is now very
high. A mistake made by any one in favor of the firm is corrected as
promptly as if the error were in favor of the other party. It is
essential to permanent success that a house should obtain a reputation
for being governed by what is fair rather than what is merely legal. A
rule which we adopted and adhered to has given greater returns than
one would believe possible, namely: always give the other party the
benefit of the doubt. This, of course, does not apply to the
speculative class. An entirely different atmosphere pervades that
world. Men are only gamblers there. Stock gambling and honorable
business are incompatible. In recent years it must be admitted that
the old-fashioned "banker," like Junius S. Morgan of London, has
become rare.

Soon after being deposed as president of the Union Pacific, Mr.
Scott[31] resolved upon the construction of the Texas Pacific
Railway. He telegraphed me one day in New York to meet him at
Philadelphia without fail. I met him there with several other friends,
among them Mr. J.N. McCullough, vice-president of the Pennsylvania
Railroad Company at Pittsburgh. A large loan for the Texas Pacific had
fallen due in London and its renewal was agreed to by Morgan & Co.,
provided I would join the other parties to the loan. I declined. I was
then asked whether I would bring them all to ruin by refusing to stand
by my friends. It was one of the most trying moments of my whole life.
Yet I was not tempted for a moment to entertain the idea of involving
myself. The question of what was my duty came first and prevented
that. All my capital was in manufacturing and every dollar of it was
required. I was the capitalist (then a modest one, indeed) of our
concern. All depended upon me. My brother with his wife and family,
Mr. Phipps and his family, Mr. Kloman and his family, all rose up
before me and claimed protection.

[Footnote 31: Colonel Thomas A. Scott left the Union Pacific in 1872.
The same year he became president of the Texas Pacific, and in 1874
president of the Pennsylvania.]

I told Mr. Scott that I had done my best to prevent him from beginning
to construct a great railway before he had secured the necessary
capital. I had insisted that thousands of miles of railway lines could
not be constructed by means of temporary loans. Besides, I had paid
two hundred and fifty thousand dollars cash for an interest in it,
which he told me upon my return from Europe he had reserved for me,
although I had never approved the scheme. But nothing in the world
would ever induce me to be guilty of endorsing the paper of that
construction company or of any other concern than our own firm.

I knew that it would be impossible for me to pay the Morgan loan in
sixty days, or even to pay my proportion of it. Besides, it was not
that loan by itself, but the half-dozen other loans that would be
required thereafter that had to be considered. This marked another
step in the total business separation which had to come between Mr.
Scott and myself. It gave more pain than all the financial trials to
which I had been subjected up to that time.

It was not long after this meeting that the disaster came and the
country was startled by the failure of those whom it had regarded as
its strongest men. I fear Mr. Scott's premature death[32] can
measurably be attributed to the humiliation which he had to bear. He
was a sensitive rather than a proud man, and his seemingly impending
failure cut him to the quick. Mr. McManus and Mr. Baird, partners in
the enterprise, also soon passed away. These two men were
manufacturers like myself and in no position to engage in railway
construction.

[Footnote 32: Died May 21, 1881.]

The business man has no rock more dangerous to encounter in his career
than this very one of endorsing commercial paper. It can easily be
avoided if he asks himself two questions: Have I surplus means for all
possible requirements which will enable me to pay without
inconvenience the utmost sum for which I am liable under this
endorsement? Secondly: Am I willing to lose this sum for the friend
for whom I endorse? If these two questions can be answered in the
affirmative he may be permitted to oblige his friend, but not
otherwise, if he be a wise man. And if he can answer the first
question in the affirmative it will be well for him to consider
whether it would not be better then and there to pay the entire sum
for which his name is asked. I am sure it would be. A man's means are
a trust to be sacredly held for his own creditors as long as he has
debts and obligations.

Notwithstanding my refusal to endorse the Morgan renewal, I was
invited to accompany the parties to New York next morning in their
special car for the purpose of consultation. This I was only too glad
to do. Anthony Drexel was also called in to accompany us. During the
journey Mr. McCullough remarked that he had been looking around the
car and had made up his mind that there was only one sensible man in
it; the rest had all been "fools." Here was "Andy" who had paid for
his shares and did not owe a dollar or have any responsibility in the
matter, and that was the position they all ought to have been in.

Mr. Drexel said he would like me to explain how I had been able to
steer clear of these unfortunate troubles. I answered: by strict
adherence to what I believed to be my duty never to put my name to
anything which I knew I could not pay at maturity; or, to recall the
familiar saying of a Western friend, never to go in where you couldn't
wade. This water was altogether too deep for me.

Regard for this rule has kept not only myself but my partners out of
trouble. Indeed, we had gone so far in our partnership agreement as to
prevent ourselves from endorsing or committing ourselves in any way
beyond trifling sums, except for the firm. This I also gave as a
reason why I could not endorse.

During the period which these events cover I had made repeated
journeys to Europe to negotiate various securities, and in all I sold
some thirty millions of dollars worth. This was at a time when the
Atlantic cable had not yet made New York a part of London financially
considered, and when London bankers would lend their balances to
Paris, Vienna, or Berlin for a shadow of difference in the rate of
interest rather than to the United States at a higher rate. The
Republic was considered less safe than the Continent by these good
people. My brother and Mr. Phipps conducted the iron business so
successfully that I could leave for weeks at a time without anxiety.
There was danger lest I should drift away from the manufacturing to
the financial and banking business. My successes abroad brought me
tempting opportunities, but my preference was always for
manufacturing. I wished to make something tangible and sell it and I
continued to invest my profits in extending the works at Pittsburgh.

The small shops put up originally for the Keystone Bridge Company had
been leased for other purposes and ten acres of ground had been
secured in Lawrenceville on which new and extensive shops were
erected. Repeated additions to the Union Iron Mills had made them the
leading mills in the United States for all sorts of structural shapes.
Business was promising and all the surplus earnings I was making in
other fields were required to expand the iron business. I had become
interested, with my friends of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, in
building some railways in the Western States, but gradually withdrew
from all such enterprises and made up my mind to go entirely contrary
to the adage not to put all one's eggs in one basket. I determined
that the proper policy was "to put all good eggs in one basket and
then watch that basket."

I believe the true road to preëminent success in any line is to make
yourself master in that line. I have no faith in the policy of
scattering one's resources, and in my experience I have rarely if ever
met a man who achieved preëminence in money-making--certainly never
one in manufacturing--who was interested in many concerns. The men who
have succeeded are men who have chosen one line and stuck to it. It is
surprising how few men appreciate the enormous dividends derivable
from investment in their own business. There is scarcely a
manufacturer in the world who has not in his works some machinery that
should be thrown out and replaced by improved appliances; or who does
not for the want of additional machinery or new methods lose more than
sufficient to pay the largest dividend obtainable by investment beyond
his own domain. And yet most business men whom I have known invest in
bank shares and in far-away enterprises, while the true gold mine lies
right in their own factories.

I have tried always to hold fast to this important fact. It has been
with me a cardinal doctrine that I could manage my own capital better
than any other person, much better than any board of directors. The
losses men encounter during a business life which seriously embarrass
them are rarely in their own business, but in enterprises of which the
investor is not master. My advice to young men would be not only to
concentrate their whole time and attention on the one business in life
in which they engage, but to put every dollar of their capital into
it. If there be any business that will not bear extension, the true
policy is to invest the surplus in first-class securities which will
yield a moderate but certain revenue if some other growing business
cannot be found. As for myself my decision was taken early. I would
concentrate upon the manufacture of iron and steel and be master in
that.

My visits to Britain gave me excellent opportunities to renew and make
acquaintance with those prominent in the iron and steel
business--Bessemer in the front, Sir Lothian Bell, Sir Bernard
Samuelson, Sir Windsor Richards, Edward Martin, Bingley, Evans, and
the whole host of captains in that industry. My election to the
council, and finally to the presidency of the British Iron and Steel
Institute soon followed, I being the first president who was not a
British subject. That honor was highly appreciated, although at first
declined, because I feared that I could not give sufficient time to
its duties, owing to my residence in America.

As we had been compelled to engage in the manufacture of wrought-iron
in order to make bridges and other structures, so now we thought it
desirable to manufacture our own pig iron. And this led to the
erection of the Lucy Furnace in the year 1870--a venture which would
have been postponed had we fully appreciated its magnitude. We heard
from time to time the ominous predictions made by our older brethren
in the manufacturing business with regard to the rapid growth and
extension of our young concern, but we were not deterred. We thought
we had sufficient capital and credit to justify the building of one
blast furnace.

The estimates made of its cost, however, did not cover more than half
the expenditure. It was an experiment with us. Mr. Kloman knew nothing
about blast-furnace operations. But even without exact knowledge no
serious blunder was made. The yield of the Lucy Furnace (named after
my bright sister-in-law) exceeded our most sanguine expectations and
the then unprecedented output of a hundred tons per day was made from
one blast furnace, for one week--an output that the world had never
heard of before. We held the record and many visitors came to marvel
at the marvel.

It was not, however, all smooth sailing with our iron business. Years
of panic came at intervals. We had passed safely through the fall in
values following the war, when iron from nine cents per pound dropped
to three. Many failures occurred and our financial manager had his
time fully occupied in providing funds to meet emergencies. Among many
wrecks our firm stood with credit unimpaired. But the manufacture of
pig iron gave us more anxiety than any other department of our
business so far. The greatest service rendered us in this branch of
manufacturing was by Mr. Whitwell, of the celebrated Whitwell Brothers
of England, whose blast-furnace stoves were so generally used. Mr.
Whitwell was one of the best-known of the visitors who came to marvel
at the Lucy Furnace, and I laid the difficulty we then were
experiencing before him. He said immediately:

"That comes from the angle of the bell being wrong."

He explained how it should be changed. Our Mr. Kloman was slow to
believe this, but I urged that a small glass-model furnace and two
bells be made, one as the Lucy was and the other as Mr. Whitwell
advised it should be. This was done, and upon my next visit
experiments were made with each, the result being just as Mr. Whitwell
had foretold. Our bell distributed the large pieces to the sides of
the furnace, leaving the center a dense mass through which the blast
could only partially penetrate. The Whitwell bell threw the pieces to
the center leaving the circumference dense. This made all the
difference in the world. The Lucy's troubles were over.

What a kind, big, broad man was Mr. Whitwell, with no narrow jealousy,
no withholding his knowledge! We had in some departments learned new
things and were able to be of service to his firm in return. At all
events, after that everything we had was open to the Whitwells.
[To-day, as I write, I rejoice that one of the two still is with us
and that our friendship is still warm. He was my predecessor in the
presidency of the British Iron and Steel Institute.]




CHAPTER XIII

THE AGE OF STEEL


Looking back to-day it seems incredible that only forty years ago
(1870) chemistry in the United States was an almost unknown agent in
connection with the manufacture of pig iron. It was the agency, above
all others, most needful in the manufacture of iron and steel. The
blast-furnace manager of that day was usually a rude bully, generally
a foreigner, who in addition to his other acquirements was able to
knock down a man now and then as a lesson to the other unruly spirits
under him. He was supposed to diagnose the condition of the furnace by
instinct, to possess some almost supernatural power of divination,
like his congener in the country districts who was reputed to be able
to locate an oil well or water supply by means of a hazel rod. He was
a veritable quack doctor who applied whatever remedies occurred to him
for the troubles of his patient.

The Lucy Furnace was out of one trouble and into another, owing to the
great variety of ores, limestone, and coke which were then supplied
with little or no regard to their component parts. This state of
affairs became intolerable to us. We finally decided to dispense with
the rule-of-thumb-and-intuition manager, and to place a young man in
charge of the furnace. We had a young shipping clerk, Henry M. Curry,
who had distinguished himself, and it was resolved to make him
manager.

Mr. Phipps had the Lucy Furnace under his special charge. His daily
visits to it saved us from failure there. Not that the furnace was not
doing as well as other furnaces in the West as to money-making, but
being so much larger than other furnaces its variations entailed much
more serious results. I am afraid my partner had something to answer
for in his Sunday morning visits to the Lucy Furnace when his good
father and sister left the house for more devotional duties. But even
if he had gone with them his real earnest prayer could not but have
had reference at times to the precarious condition of the Lucy Furnace
then absorbing his thoughts.

The next step taken was to find a chemist as Mr. Curry's assistant and
guide. We found the man in a learned German, Dr. Fricke, and great
secrets did the doctor open up to us. Iron stone from mines that had a
high reputation was now found to contain ten, fifteen, and even twenty
per cent less iron than it had been credited with. Mines that hitherto
had a poor reputation we found to be now yielding superior ore. The
good was bad and the bad was good, and everything was topsy-turvy.
Nine tenths of all the uncertainties of pig-iron making were dispelled
under the burning sun of chemical knowledge.

At a most critical period when it was necessary for the credit of the
firm that the blast furnace should make its best product, it had been
stopped because an exceedingly rich and pure ore had been substituted
for an inferior ore--an ore which did not yield more than two thirds
of the quantity of iron of the other. The furnace had met with
disaster because too much lime had been used to flux this
exceptionally pure ironstone. The very superiority of the materials
had involved us in serious losses.

What fools we had been! But then there was this consolation: we were
not as great fools as our competitors. It was years after we had taken
chemistry to guide us that it was said by the proprietors of some
other furnaces that they could not afford to employ a chemist. Had
they known the truth then, they would have known that they could not
afford to be without one. Looking back it seems pardonable to record
that we were the first to employ a chemist at blast
furnaces--something our competitors pronounced extravagant.

The Lucy Furnace became the most profitable branch of our business,
because we had almost the entire monopoly of scientific management.
Having discovered the secret, it was not long (1872) before we decided
to erect an additional furnace. This was done with great economy as
compared with our first experiment. The mines which had no reputation
and the products of which many firms would not permit to be used in
their blast furnaces found a purchaser in us. Those mines which were
able to obtain an enormous price for their products, owing to a
reputation for quality, we quietly ignored. A curious illustration of
this was the celebrated Pilot Knob mine in Missouri. Its product was,
so to speak, under a cloud. A small portion of it only could be used,
it was said, without obstructing the furnace. Chemistry told us that
it was low in phosphorus, but very high in silicon. There was no
better ore and scarcely any as rich, if it were properly fluxed. We
therefore bought heavily of this and received the thanks of the
proprietors for rendering their property valuable.

It is hardly believable that for several years we were able to dispose
of the highly phosphoric cinder from the puddling furnaces at a higher
price than we had to pay for the pure cinder from the heating furnaces
of our competitors--a cinder which was richer in iron than the puddled
cinder and much freer from phosphorus. Upon some occasion a blast
furnace had attempted to smelt the flue cinder, and from its greater
purity the furnace did not work well with a mixture intended for an
impurer article; hence for years it was thrown over the banks of the
river at Pittsburgh by our competitors as worthless. In some cases we
were even able to exchange a poor article for a good one and obtain a
bonus.

But it is still more unbelievable that a prejudice, equally unfounded,
existed against putting into the blast furnaces the roll-scale from
the mills which was pure oxide of iron. This reminds me of my dear
friend and fellow-Dunfermline townsman, Mr. Chisholm, of Cleveland. We
had many pranks together. One day, when I was visiting his works at
Cleveland, I saw men wheeling this valuable roll-scale into the yard.
I asked Mr. Chisholm where they were going with it, and he said:

"To throw it over the bank. Our managers have always complained that
they had bad luck when they attempted to remelt it in the blast
furnace."

I said nothing, but upon my return to Pittsburgh I set about having a
joke at his expense. We had then a young man in our service named Du
Puy, whose father was known as the inventor of a direct process in
iron-making with which he was then experimenting in Pittsburgh. I
recommended our people to send Du Puy to Cleveland to contract for all
the roll-scale of my friend's establishment. He did so, buying it for
fifty cents per ton and having it shipped to him direct. This
continued for some time. I expected always to hear of the joke being
discovered. The premature death of Mr. Chisholm occurred before I
could apprise him of it. His successors soon, however, followed our
example.

I had not failed to notice the growth of the Bessemer process. If this
proved successful I knew that iron was destined to give place to
steel; that the Iron Age would pass away and the Steel Age take its
place. My friend, John A. Wright, president of the Freedom Iron Works
at Lewiston, Pennsylvania, had visited England purposely to
investigate the new process. He was one of our best and most
experienced manufacturers, and his decision was so strongly in its
favor that he induced his company to erect Bessemer works. He was
quite right, but just a little in advance of his time. The capital
required was greater than he estimated. More than this, it was not to
be expected that a process which was even then in somewhat of an
experimental stage in Britain could be transplanted to the new country
and operated successfully from the start. The experiment was certain
to be long and costly, and for this my friend had not made sufficient
allowance.

At a later date, when the process had become established in England,
capitalists began to erect the present Pennsylvania Steel Works at
Harrisburg. These also had to pass through an experimental stage and
at a critical moment would probably have been wrecked but for the
timely assistance of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company. It required a
broad and able man like President Thomson, of the Pennsylvania
Railroad, to recommend to his board of directors that so large a sum
as six hundred thousand dollars should be advanced to a manufacturing
concern on his road, that steel rails might be secured for the line.
The result fully justified his action.

The question of a substitute for iron rails upon the Pennsylvania
Railroad and other leading lines had become a very serious one. Upon
certain curves at Pittsburgh, on the road connecting the Pennsylvania
with the Fort Wayne, I had seen new iron rails placed every six weeks
or two months. Before the Bessemer process was known I had called
President Thomson's attention to the efforts of Mr. Dodds in England,
who had carbonized the heads of iron rails with good results. I went
to England and obtained control of the Dodds patents and recommended
President Thomson to appropriate twenty thousand dollars for
experiments at Pittsburgh, which he did. We built a furnace on our
grounds at the upper mill and treated several hundred tons of rails
for the Pennsylvania Railroad Company and with remarkably good results
as compared with iron rails. These were the first hard-headed rails
used in America. We placed them on some of the sharpest curves and
their superior service far more than compensated for the advance made
by Mr. Thomson. Had the Bessemer process not been successfully
developed, I verily believe that we should ultimately have been able
to improve the Dodds process sufficiently to make its adoption
general. But there was nothing to be compared with the solid steel
article which the Bessemer process produced.

Our friends of the Cambria Iron Company at Johnstown, near
Pittsburgh--the principal manufacturers of rails in America--decided
to erect a Bessemer plant. In England I had seen it demonstrated, at
least to my satisfaction, that the process could be made a grand
success without undue expenditure of capital or great risk. Mr.
William Coleman, who was ever alive to new methods, arrived at the
same conclusion. It was agreed we should enter upon the manufacture of
steel rails at Pittsburgh. He became a partner and also my dear friend
Mr. David McCandless, who had so kindly offered aid to my mother at my
father's death. The latter was not forgotten. Mr. John Scott and Mr.
David A. Stewart, and others joined me; Mr. Edgar Thomson and Mr.
Thomas A. Scott, president and vice-president of the Pennsylvania
Railroad, also became stockholders, anxious to encourage the
development of steel. The steel-rail company was organized January 1,
1873.

The question of location was the first to engage our serious
attention. I could not reconcile myself to any location that was
proposed, and finally went to Pittsburgh to consult with my partners
about it. The subject was constantly in my mind and in bed Sunday
morning the site suddenly appeared to me. I rose and called to my
brother:

"Tom, you and Mr. Coleman are right about the location; right at
Braddock's, between the Pennsylvania, the Baltimore and Ohio, and the
river, is the best situation in America; and let's call the works
after our dear friend Edgar Thomson. Let us go over to Mr. Coleman's
and drive out to Braddock's."

We did so that day, and the next morning Mr. Coleman was at work
trying to secure the property. Mr. McKinney, the owner, had a high
idea of the value of his farm. What we had expected to purchase for
five or six hundred dollars an acre cost us two thousand. But since
then we have been compelled to add to our original purchase at a cost
of five thousand dollars per acre.

There, on the very field of Braddock's defeat, we began the erection
of our steel-rail mills. In excavating for the foundations many relics
of the battle were found--bayonets, swords, and the like. It was there
that the then provost of Dunfermline, Sir Arthur Halkett, and his son
were slain. How did they come to be there will very naturally be
asked. It must not be forgotten that, in those days, the provosts of
the cities of Britain were members of the aristocracy--the great men
of the district who condescended to enjoy the honor of the position
without performing the duties. No one in trade was considered good
enough for the provostship. We have remnants of this aristocratic
notion throughout Britain to-day. There is scarcely any life assurance
or railway company, or in some cases manufacturing company but must
have at its head, to enjoy the honors of the presidency, some titled
person totally ignorant of the duties of the position. So it was that
Sir Arthur Halkett, as a gentleman, was Provost of Dunfermline, but by
calling he followed the profession of arms and was killed on this
spot. It was a coincidence that what had been the field of death to
two native-born citizens of Dunfermline should be turned into an
industrial hive by two others.

Another curious fact has recently been discovered. Mr. John Morley's
address, in 1904 on Founder's Day at the Carnegie Institute,
Pittsburgh, referred to the capture of Fort Duquesne by General Forbes
and his writing Prime Minister Pitt that he had rechristened it
"Pittsburgh" for him. This General Forbes was then Laird of
Pittencrieff and was born in the Glen which I purchased in 1902 and
presented to Dunfermline for a public park. So that two Dunfermline
men have been Lairds of Pittencrieff whose chief work was in
Pittsburgh. One named Pittsburgh and the other labored for its
development.

In naming the steel mills as we did the desire was to honor my friend
Edgar Thomson, but when I asked permission to use his name his reply
was significant. He said that as far as American steel rails were
concerned, he did not feel that he wished to connect his name with
them, for they had proved to be far from creditable. Uncertainty was,
of course, inseparable from the experimental stage; but, when I
assured him that it was now possible to make steel rails in America
as good in every particular as the foreign article, and that we
intended to obtain for our rails the reputation enjoyed by the
Keystone bridges and the Kloman axles, he consented.

He was very anxious to have us purchase land upon the Pennsylvania
Railroad, as his first thought was always for that company. This would
have given the Pennsylvania a monopoly of our traffic. When he visited
Pittsburgh a few months later and Mr. Robert Pitcairn, my successor as
superintendent of the Pittsburgh Division of the Pennsylvania, pointed
out to him the situation of the new works at Braddock's Station, which
gave us not only a connection with his own line, but also with the
rival Baltimore and Ohio line, and with a rival in one respect greater
than either--the Ohio River--he said, with a twinkle of his eye to
Robert, as Robert told me:

"Andy should have located his works a few miles farther east." But Mr.
Thomson knew the good and sufficient reasons which determined the
selection of the unrivaled site.

The works were well advanced when the financial panic of September,
1873, came upon us. I then entered upon the most anxious period of my
business life. All was going well when one morning in our summer
cottage, in the Allegheny Mountains at Cresson, a telegram came
announcing the failure of Jay Cooke & Co. Almost every hour after
brought news of some fresh disaster. House after house failed. The
question every morning was which would go next. Every failure depleted
the resources of other concerns. Loss after loss ensued, until a total
paralysis of business set in. Every weak spot was discovered and
houses that otherwise would have been strong were borne down largely
because our country lacked a proper banking system.

We had not much reason to be anxious about our debts. Not what we had
to pay of our own debts could give us much trouble, but rather what we
might have to pay for our debtors. It was not our bills payable but
our bills receivable which required attention, for we soon had to
begin meeting both. Even our own banks had to beg us not to draw upon
our balances. One incident will shed some light upon the currency
situation. One of our pay-days was approaching. One hundred thousand
dollars in small notes were absolutely necessary, and to obtain these
we paid a premium of twenty-four hundred dollars in New York and had
them expressed to Pittsburgh. It was impossible to borrow money, even
upon the best collaterals; but by selling securities, which I had in
reserve, considerable sums were realized--the company undertaking to
replace them later.

It happened that some of the railway companies whose lines centered in
Pittsburgh owed us large sums for material furnished--the Fort Wayne
road being the largest debtor. I remember calling upon Mr. Thaw, the
vice-president of the Fort Wayne, and telling him we must have our
money. He replied:

"You ought to have your money, but we are not paying anything these
days that is not protestable."

"Very good," I said, "your freight bills are in that category and we
shall follow your excellent example. Now I am going to order that we
do not pay you one dollar for freight."

"Well, if you do that," he said, "we will stop your freight."

I said we would risk that. The railway company could not proceed to
that extremity. And as a matter of fact we ran for some time without
paying the freight bills. It was simply impossible for the
manufacturers of Pittsburgh to pay their accruing liabilities when
their customers stopped payment. The banks were forced to renew
maturing paper. They behaved splendidly to us, as they always have
done, and we steered safely through. But in a critical period like
this there was one thought uppermost with me, to gather more capital
and keep it in our business so that come what would we should never
again be called upon to endure such nights and days of racking
anxiety.

Speaking for myself in this great crisis, I was at first the most
excited and anxious of the partners. I could scarcely control myself.
But when I finally saw the strength of our financial position I became
philosophically cool and found myself quite prepared, if necessary, to
enter the directors' rooms of the various banks with which we dealt,
and lay our entire position before their boards. I felt that this
could result in nothing discreditable to us. No one interested in our
business had lived extravagantly. Our manner of life had been the very
reverse of this. No money had been withdrawn from the business to
build costly homes, and, above all, not one of us had made speculative
ventures upon the stock exchange, or invested in any other enterprises
than those connected with the main business. Neither had we exchanged
endorsements with others. Besides this we could show a prosperous
business that was making money every year.

I was thus enabled to laugh away the fears of my partners, but none of
them rejoiced more than I did that the necessity for opening our lips
to anybody about our finances did not arise. Mr. Coleman, good friend
and true, with plentiful means and splendid credit, did not fail to
volunteer to give us his endorsements. In this we stood alone; William
Coleman's name, a tower of strength, was for us only. How the grand
old man comes before me as I write. His patriotism knew no bounds.
Once when visiting his mills, stopped for the Fourth of July, as they
always were, he found a corps of men at work repairing the boilers. He
called the manager to him and asked what this meant. He ordered all
work suspended.

"Work on the Fourth of July!" he exclaimed, "when there's plenty of
Sundays for repairs!" He was furious.

When the cyclone of 1873 struck us we at once began to reef sail in
every quarter. Very reluctantly did we decide that the construction of
the new steel works must cease for a time. Several prominent persons,
who had invested in them, became unable to meet their payments and I
was compelled to take over their interests, repaying the full cost to
all. In that way control of the company came into my hands.

The first outburst of the storm had affected the financial world
connected with the Stock Exchange. It was some time before it reached
the commercial and manufacturing world. But the situation grew worse
and worse and finally led to the crash which involved my friends in
the Texas Pacific enterprise, of which I have already spoken. This was
to me the severest blow of all. People could, with difficulty, believe
that occupying such intimate relations as I did with the Texas group,
I could by any possibility have kept myself clear of their financial
obligations.

Mr. Schoenberger, president of the Exchange Bank at Pittsburgh, with
which we conducted a large business, was in New York when the news
reached him of the embarrassment of Mr. Scott and Mr. Thomson. He
hastened to Pittsburgh, and at a meeting of his board next morning
said it was simply impossible that I was not involved with them. He
suggested that the bank should refuse to discount more of our bills
receivable. He was alarmed to find that the amount of these bearing
our endorsement and under discount, was so large. Prompt action on my
part was necessary to prevent serious trouble. I took the first train
for Pittsburgh, and was able to announce there to all concerned that,
although I was a shareholder in the Texas enterprise, my interest was
paid for. My name was not upon one dollar of their paper or of any
other outstanding paper. I stood clear and clean without a financial
obligation or property which I did not own and which was not fully
paid for. My only obligations were those connected with our business;
and I was prepared to pledge for it every dollar I owned, and to
endorse every obligation the firm had outstanding.

Up to this time I had the reputation in business of being a bold,
fearless, and perhaps a somewhat reckless young man. Our operations
had been extensive, our growth rapid and, although still young, I had
been handling millions. My own career was thought by the elderly ones
of Pittsburgh to have been rather more brilliant than substantial. I
know of an experienced one who declared that if "Andrew Carnegie's
brains did not carry him through his luck would." But I think nothing
could be farther from the truth than the estimate thus suggested. I am
sure that any competent judge would be surprised to find how little I
ever risked for myself or my partners. When I did big things, some
large corporation like the Pennsylvania Railroad Company was behind me
and the responsible party. My supply of Scotch caution never has been
small; but I was apparently something of a dare-devil now and then to
the manufacturing fathers of Pittsburgh. They were old and I was
young, which made all the difference.

The fright which Pittsburgh financial institutions had with regard to
myself and our enterprises rapidly gave place to perhaps somewhat
unreasoning confidence. Our credit became unassailable, and thereafter
in times of financial pressure the offerings of money to us increased
rather than diminished, just as the deposits of the old Bank of
Pittsburgh were never so great as when the deposits in other banks ran
low. It was the only bank in America which redeemed its circulation in
gold, disdaining to take refuge under the law and pay its obligations
in greenbacks. It had few notes, and I doubt not the decision paid as
an advertisement.

In addition to the embarrassment of my friends Mr. Scott, Mr. Thomson,
and others, there came upon us later an even severer trial in the
discovery that our partner, Mr. Andrew Kloman, had been led by a party
of speculative people into the Escanaba Iron Company. He was assured
that the concern was to be made a stock company, but before this was
done his colleagues had succeeded in creating an enormous amount of
liabilities--about seven hundred thousand dollars. There was nothing
but bankruptcy as a means of reinstating Mr. Kloman.

This gave us more of a shock than all that had preceded, because Mr.
Kloman, being a partner, had no right to invest in another iron
company, or in any other company involving personal debt, without
informing his partners. There is one imperative rule for men in
business--no secrets from partners. Disregard of this rule involved
not only Mr. Kloman himself, but our company, in peril, coming, as it
did, atop of the difficulties of my Texas Pacific friends with whom I
had been intimately associated. The question for a time was whether
there was anything really sound. Where could we find bedrock upon
which we could stand?

Had Mr. Kloman been a business man it would have been impossible ever
to allow him to be a partner with us again after this discovery. He
was not such, however, but the ablest of practical mechanics with some
business ability. Mr. Kloman's ambition had been to be in the office,
where he was worse than useless, rather than in the mill devising and
running new machinery, where he was without a peer. We had some
difficulty in placing him in his proper position and keeping him
there, which may have led him to seek an outlet elsewhere. He was
perhaps flattered by men who were well known in the community; and in
this case he was led by persons who knew how to reach him by extolling
his wonderful business abilities in addition to his mechanical
genius--abilities which his own partners, as already suggested, but
faintly recognized.

After Mr. Kloman had passed through the bankruptcy court and was again
free, we offered him a ten per cent interest in our business, charging
for it only the actual capital invested, with nothing whatever for
good-will. This we were to carry for him until the profits paid for
it. We were to charge interest only on the cost, and he was to assume
no responsibility. The offer was accompanied by the condition that he
should not enter into any other business or endorse for others, but
give his whole time and attention to the mechanical and not the
business management of the mills. Could he have been persuaded to
accept this, he would have been a multimillionaire; but his pride, and
more particularly that of his family, perhaps, would not permit this.
He would go into business on his own account, and, notwithstanding
the most urgent appeals on my part, and that of my colleagues, he
persisted in the determination to start a new rival concern with his
sons as business managers. The result was failure and premature death.

How foolish we are not to recognize what we are best fitted for and
can perform, not only with ease but with pleasure, as masters of the
craft. More than one able man I have known has persisted in blundering
in an office when he had great talent for the mill, and has worn
himself out, oppressed with cares and anxieties, his life a continual
round of misery, and the result at last failure. I never regretted
parting with any man so much as Mr. Kloman. His was a good heart, a
great mechanical brain, and had he been left to himself I believe he
would have been glad to remain with us. Offers of capital from
others--offers which failed when needed--turned his head, and the
great mechanic soon proved the poor man of affairs.[33]

[Footnote 33: Long after the circumstances here recited, Mr. Isidor
Straus called upon Mr. Henry Phipps and asked him if two statements
which had been publicly made about Mr. Carnegie and his partners in
the steel company were true. Mr. Phipps replied they were not. Then
said Mr. Straus:

"Mr. Phipps, you owe it to yourself and also to Mr. Carnegie to say so
publicly."

This Mr. Phipps did in the _New York Herald_, January 30, 1904, in the
following handsome manner and without Mr. Carnegie's knowledge:

_Question:_ "In a recent publication mention was made of Mr.
Carnegie's not having treated Mr. Miller, Mr. Kloman, and yourself
properly during your early partnership, and at its termination. Can
you tell me anything about this?"

_Answer:_ "Mr. Miller has already spoken for himself in this matter,
and I can say that the treatment received from Mr. Carnegie during our
partnership, so far as I was concerned, was always fair and liberal.

"My association with Mr. Kloman in business goes back forty-three
years. Everything in connection with Mr. Carnegie's partnership with
Mr. Kloman was of a pleasant nature.

"At a much more recent date, when the firm of Carnegie, Kloman and
Company was formed, the partners were Andrew Carnegie, Thomas M.
Carnegie, Andrew Kloman, and myself. The Carnegies held the
controlling interest.

"After the partnership agreement was signed, Mr. Kloman said to me
that the Carnegies, owning the larger interest, might be too
enterprising in making improvements, which might lead us into serious
trouble; and he thought that they should consent to an article in the
partnership agreement requiring the consent of three partners to make
effective any vote for improvements. I told him that we could not
exact what he asked, as their larger interest assured them control,
but I would speak to them. When the subject was broached, Mr. Carnegie
promptly said that if he could not carry Mr. Kloman or myself with his
brother in any improvements he would not wish them made. Other matters
were arranged by courtesy during our partnership in the same manner."

_Question:_ "What you have told me suggests the question, why did Mr.
Kloman leave the firm?"

_Answer:_ "During the great depression which followed the panic of
1873, Mr. Kloman, through an unfortunate partnership in the Escanaba
Furnace Company, lost his means, and his interest in our firm had to
be disposed of. We bought it at book value at a time when
manufacturing properties were selling at ruinous prices, often as low
as one third or one half their cost.

"After the settlement had been made with the creditors of the Escanaba
Company, Mr. Kloman was offered an interest by Mr. Carnegie of
$100,000 in our firm, to be paid only from future profits. This Mr.
Kloman declined, as he did not feel like taking an interest which
formerly had been much larger. Mr. Carnegie gave him $40,000 from the
firm to make a new start. This amount was invested in a rival concern,
which soon closed.

"I knew of no disagreement during this early period with Mr. Carnegie,
and their relations continued pleasant as long as Mr. Kloman lived.
Harmony always marked their intercourse, and they had the kindliest
feeling one for the other."]




CHAPTER XIV

PARTNERS, BOOKS, AND TRAVEL


When Mr. Kloman had severed his connection with us there was no
hesitation in placing William Borntraeger in charge of the mills. It
has always been with especial pleasure that I have pointed to the
career of William. He came direct from Germany--a young man who could
not speak English, but being distantly connected with Mr. Kloman was
employed in the mills, at first in a minor capacity. He promptly
learned English and became a shipping clerk at six dollars per week.
He had not a particle of mechanical knowledge, and yet such was his
unflagging zeal and industry for the interests of his employer that he
soon became marked for being everywhere about the mill, knowing
everything, and attending to everything.

William was a character. He never got over his German idioms and his
inverted English made his remarks very effective. Under his
superintendence the Union Iron Mills became a most profitable branch
of our business. He had overworked himself after a few years'
application and we decided to give him a trip to Europe. He came to
New York by way of Washington. When he called upon me in New York he
expressed himself as more anxious to return to Pittsburgh than to
revisit Germany. In ascending the Washington Monument he had seen the
Carnegie beams in the stairway and also at other points in public
buildings, and as he expressed it:

"It yust make me so broud dat I want to go right back and see dat
everyting is going right at de mill."

Early hours in the morning and late in the dark hours at night
William was in the mills. His life was there. He was among the first
of the young men we admitted to partnership, and the poor German lad
at his death was in receipt of an income, as I remember, of about
$50,000 a year, every cent of which was deserved. Stories about him
are many. At a dinner of our partners to celebrate the year's
business, short speeches were in order from every one. William summed
up his speech thus:

"What we haf to do, shentlemens, is to get brices up and costs down
and efery man _stand on his own bottom_." There was loud, prolonged,
and repeated laughter.

Captain Evans ("Fighting Bob") was at one time government inspector at
our mills. He was a severe one. William was sorely troubled at times
and finally offended the Captain, who complained of his behavior. We
tried to get William to realize the importance of pleasing a
government official. William's reply was:

"But he gomes in and smokes my cigars" (bold Captain! William reveled
in one-cent Wheeling tobies) "and then he goes and contems my iron.
What does you tinks of a man like dat? But I apologize and dreat him
right to-morrow."

The Captain was assured William had agreed to make due amends, but he
laughingly told us afterward that William's apology was:

"Vell, Captain, I hope you vas all right dis morning. I haf noting
against you, Captain," holding out his hand, which the Captain finally
took and all was well.

William once sold to our neighbor, the pioneer steel-maker of
Pittsburgh, James Park, a large lot of old rails which we could not
use. Mr. Park found them of a very bad quality. He made claims for
damages and William was told that he must go with Mr. Phipps to meet
Mr. Park and settle. Mr. Phipps went into Mr. Park's office, while
William took a look around the works in search of the condemned
material, which was nowhere to be seen. Well did William know where to
look. He finally entered the office, and before Mr. Park had time to
say a word William began:

"Mr. Park, I vas glad to hear dat de old rails what I sell you don't
suit for steel. I will buy dem all from you back, five dollars ton
profit for you." Well did William know that they had all been used.
Mr. Park was non-plussed, and the affair ended. William had triumphed.

Upon one of my visits to Pittsburgh William told me he had something
"particular" he wished to tell me--something he couldn't tell any one
else. This was upon his return from the trip to Germany. There he had
been asked to visit for a few days a former schoolfellow, who had
risen to be a professor:

"Well, Mr. Carnegie, his sister who kept his house was very kind to
me, and ven I got to Hamburg I tought I sent her yust a little
present. She write me a letter, then I write her a letter. She write
me and I write her, and den I ask her would she marry me. She was very
educated, but she write yes. Den I ask her to come to New York, and I
meet her dere, but, Mr. Carnegie, dem people don't know noting about
business and de mills. Her bruder write me dey want me to go dere
again and marry her in Chairmany, and I can go away not again from de
mills. I tought I yust ask you aboud it."

"Of course you can go again. Quite right, William, you should go. I
think the better of her people for feeling so. You go over at once and
bring her home. I'll arrange it." Then, when parting, I said:
"William, I suppose your sweetheart is a beautiful, tall,
'peaches-and-cream' kind of German young lady."

"Vell, Mr. Carnegie, she is a leetle stout. If _I had the rolling of
her I give her yust one more pass_." All William's illustrations were
founded on mill practice. [I find myself bursting into fits of
laughter this morning (June, 1912) as I re-read this story. But I did
this also when reading that "Every man must stand on his own bottom."]

Mr. Phipps had been head of the commercial department of the mills,
but when our business was enlarged, he was required for the steel
business. Another young man, William L. Abbott, took his place. Mr.
Abbott's history is somewhat akin to Borntraeger's. He came to us as a
clerk upon a small salary and was soon assigned to the front in charge
of the business of the iron mills. He was no less successful than was
William. He became a partner with an interest equal to William's, and
finally was promoted to the presidency of the company.

Mr. Curry had distinguished himself by this time in his management of
the Lucy Furnaces, and he took his place among the partners, sharing
equally with the others. There is no way of making a business
successful that can vie with the policy of promoting those who render
exceptional service. We finally converted the firm of Carnegie,
McCandless & Co. into the Edgar Thomson Steel Company, and included my
brother and Mr. Phipps, both of whom had declined at first to go into
the steel business with their too enterprising senior. But when I
showed them the earnings for the first year and told them if they did
not get into steel they would find themselves in the wrong boat, they
both reconsidered and came with us. It was fortunate for them as for
us.

My experience has been that no partnership of new men gathered
promiscuously from various fields can prove a good working
organization as at first constituted. Changes are required. Our Edgar
Thomson Steel Company was no exception to this rule. Even before we
began to make rails, Mr. Coleman became dissatisfied with the
management of a railway official who had come to us with a great and
deserved reputation for method and ability. I had, therefore, to take
over Mr. Coleman's interest. It was not long, however, before we found
that his judgment was correct. The new man had been a railway auditor,
and was excellent in accounts, but it was unjust to expect him, or any
other office man, to be able to step into manufacturing and be
successful from the start. He had neither the knowledge nor the
training for this new work. This does not mean that he was not a
splendid auditor. It was our own blunder in expecting the impossible.

The mills were at last about ready to begin[34] and an organization
the auditor proposed was laid before me for approval. I found he had
divided the works into two departments and had given control of one to
Mr. Stevenson, a Scotsman who afterwards made a fine record as a
manufacturer, and control of the other to a Mr. Jones. Nothing, I am
certain, ever affected the success of the steel company more than the
decision which I gave upon that proposal. Upon no account could two
men be in the same works with equal authority. An army with two
commanders-in-chief, a ship with two captains, could not fare more
disastrously than a manufacturing concern with two men in command upon
the same ground, even though in two different departments. I said:

"This will not do. I do not know Mr. Stevenson, nor do I know Mr.
Jones, but one or the other must be made captain and he alone must
report to you."

[Footnote 34: The steel-rail mills were ready and rails were rolled in
1874.]

The decision fell upon Mr. Jones and in this way we obtained "The
Captain," who afterward made his name famous wherever the manufacture
of Bessemer steel is known.

The Captain was then quite young, spare and active, bearing traces of
his Welsh descent even in his stature, for he was quite short. He came
to us as a two-dollar-a-day mechanic from the neighboring works at
Johnstown. We soon saw that he was a character. Every movement told
it. He had volunteered as a private during the Civil War and carried
himself so finely that he became captain of a company which was never
known to flinch. Much of the success of the Edgar Thomson Works
belongs to this man.

In later years he declined an interest in the firm which would have
made him a millionaire. I told him one day that some of the young men
who had been given an interest were now making much more than he was
and we had voted to make him a partner. This entailed no financial
responsibility, as we always provided that the cost of the interest
given was payable only out of profits.

"No," he said, "I don't want to have my thoughts running on business.
I have enough trouble looking after these works. Just give me a h--l
of a salary if you think I'm worth it."

"All right, Captain, the salary of the President of the United States
is yours."

"That's the talk," said the little Welshman.[35]

[Footnote 35: The story is told that when Mr. Carnegie was selecting
his younger partners he one day sent for a young Scotsman, Alexander
R. Peacock, and asked him rather abruptly:

"Peacock, what would you give to be made a millionaire?"

"A liberal discount for cash, sir," was the answer.

He was a partner owning a two per cent interest when the Carnegie
Steel Company was merged into the United States Steel Corporation.]

Our competitors in steel were at first disposed to ignore us. Knowing
the difficulties they had in starting their own steel works, they
could not believe we would be ready to deliver rails for another year
and declined to recognize us as competitors. The price of steel rails
when we began was about seventy dollars per ton. We sent our agent
through the country with instructions to take orders at the best
prices he could obtain; and before our competitors knew it, we had
obtained a large number--quite sufficient to justify us in making a
start.

So perfect was the machinery, so admirable the plans, so skillful were
the men selected by Captain Jones, and so great a manager was he
himself, that our success was phenomenal. I think I place a unique
statement on record when I say that the result of the first month's
operations left a margin of profit of $11,000. It is also remarkable
that so perfect was our system of accounts that we knew the exact
amount of the profit. We had learned from experience in our iron works
what exact accounting meant. There is nothing more profitable than
clerks to check up each transfer of material from one department to
another in process of manufacture.

The new venture in steel having started off so promisingly, I began to
think of taking a holiday, and my long-cherished purpose of going
around the world came to the front. Mr. J.W. Vandevort ("Vandy") and I
accordingly set out in the autumn of 1878. I took with me several pads
suitable for penciling and began to make a few notes day by day, not
with any intention of publishing a book; but thinking, perhaps, I
might print a few copies of my notes for private circulation. The
sensation which one has when he first sees his remarks in the form of
a printed book is great. When the package came from the printers I
re-read the book trying to decide whether it was worth while to send
copies to my friends. I came to the conclusion that upon the whole it
was best to do so and await the verdict.

The writer of a book designed for his friends has no reason to
anticipate an unkind reception, but there is always some danger of its
being damned with faint praise. The responses in my case, however,
exceeded expectations, and were of such a character as to satisfy me
that the writers really had enjoyed the book, or meant at least a part
of what they said about it. Every author is prone to believe sweet
words. Among the first that came were in a letter from Anthony Drexel,
Philadelphia's great banker, complaining that I had robbed him of
several hours of sleep. Having begun the book he could not lay it down
and retired at two o'clock in the morning after finishing. Several
similar letters were received. I remember Mr. Huntington, president of
the Central Pacific Railway, meeting me one morning and saying he was
going to pay me a great compliment.

"What is it?" Tasked.

"Oh, I read your book from end to end."

"Well," I said, "that is not such a great compliment. Others of our
mutual friends have done that."

"Oh, yes, but probably none of your friends are like me. I have not
read a book for years except my ledger and I did not intend to read
yours, but when I began it I could not lay it down. My ledger is the
only book I have gone through for five years."

I was not disposed to credit all that my friends said, but others who
had obtained the book from them were pleased with it and I lived for
some months under intoxicating, but I trust not perilously pernicious,
flattery. Several editions of the book were printed to meet the
request for copies. Some notices of it and extracts got into the
papers, and finally Charles Scribner's Sons asked to publish it for
the market. So "Round the World"[36] came before the public and I was
at last "an author."

[Footnote 36: _Round the World_, by Andrew Carnegie. New York and
London, 1884.]

A new horizon was opened up to me by this voyage. It quite changed my
intellectual outlook. Spencer and Darwin were then high in the zenith,
and I had become deeply interested in their work. I began to view the
various phases of human life from the standpoint of the evolutionist.
In China I read Confucius; in India, Buddha and the sacred books of
the Hindoos; among the Parsees, in Bombay, I studied Zoroaster. The
result of my journey was to bring a certain mental peace. Where there
had been chaos there was now order. My mind was at rest. I had a
philosophy at last. The words of Christ "The Kingdom of Heaven is
within you," had a new meaning for me. Not in the past or in the
future, but now and here is Heaven within us. All our duties lie in
this world and in the present, and trying impatiently to peer into
that which lies beyond is as vain as fruitless.

All the remnants of theology in which I had been born and bred, all
the impressions that Swedenborg had made upon me, now ceased to
influence me or to occupy my thoughts. I found that no nation had all
the truth in the revelation it regards as divine, and no tribe is so
low as to be left without some truth; that every people has had its
great teacher; Buddha for one; Confucius for another; Zoroaster for a
third; Christ for a fourth. The teachings of all these I found
ethically akin so that I could say with Matthew Arnold, one I was so
proud to call friend:

    "Children of men! the unseen Power, whose eye
    For ever doth accompany mankind
    Hath looked on no religion scornfully
        That men did ever find.

    Which has not taught weak wills how much they can?
    Which has not fall'n in the dry heart like rain?
    Which has not cried to sunk, self-weary man,
        _Thou must be born again_."

"The Light of Asia," by Edwin Arnold, came out at this time and gave
me greater delight than any similar poetical work I had recently read.
I had just been in India and the book took me there again. My
appreciation of it reached the author's ears and later having made his
acquaintance in London, he presented me with the original manuscript
of the book. It is one of my most precious treasures. Every person who
can, even at a sacrifice, make the voyage around the world should do
so. All other travel compared to it seems incomplete, gives us merely
vague impressions of parts of the whole. When the circle has been
completed, you feel on your return that you have seen (of course only
in the mass) all there is to be seen. The parts fit into one
symmetrical whole and you see humanity wherever it is placed working
out a destiny tending to one definite end.

The world traveler who gives careful study to the bibles of the
various religions of the East will be well repaid. The conclusion
reached will be that the inhabitants of each country consider their
own religion the best of all. They rejoice that their lot has been
cast where it is, and are disposed to pity the less fortunate
condemned to live beyond their sacred limits. The masses of all
nations are usually happy, each mass certain that:

    "East or West
    Home is best."

Two illustrations of this from our "Round the World" trip may be
noted:

     Visiting the tapioca workers in the woods near Singapore, we
     found them busily engaged, the children running about stark
     naked, the parents clothed in the usual loose rags. Our
     party attracted great attention. We asked our guide to tell
     the people that we came from a country where the water in
     such a pond as that before us would become solid at this
     season of the year and we could walk upon it and that
     sometimes it would be so hard horses and wagons crossed wide
     rivers on the ice. They wondered and asked why we didn't
     come and live among them. They really were very happy.

Again:

     On the way to the North Cape we visited a reindeer camp of
     the Laplanders. A sailor from the ship was deputed to go
     with the party. I walked homeward with him, and as we
     approached the fiord looking down and over to the opposite
     shore we saw a few straggling huts and one two-story house
     under construction. What is that new building for? we asked.

     "That is to be the home of a man born in Tromso who has made
     a great deal of money and has now come back to spend his
     days there. He is very rich."

     "You told me you had travelled all over the world. You have
     seen London, New York, Calcutta, Melbourne, and other
     places. If you made a fortune like that man what place would
     you make your home in old age?" His eye glistened as he
     said:

     "Ah, there's no place like Tromso." This is in the arctic
     circle, six months of night, but he had been born in Tromso.
     Home, sweet, sweet home!

Among the conditions of life or the laws of nature, some of which seem
to us faulty, some apparently unjust and merciless, there are many
that amaze us by their beauty and sweetness. Love of home, regardless
of its character or location, certainly is one of these. And what a
pleasure it is to find that, instead of the Supreme Being confining
revelation to one race or nation, every race has the message best
adapted for it in its present stage of development. The Unknown Power
has neglected none.




CHAPTER XV

COACHING TRIP AND MARRIAGE


The Freedom of my native town (Dunfermline) was conferred upon me July
12, 1877, the first Freedom and the greatest honor I ever received. I
was overwhelmed. Only two signatures upon the roll came between mine
and Sir Walter Scott's, who had been made a Burgess. My parents had
seen him one day sketching Dunfermline Abbey and often told me about
his appearance. My speech in reply to the Freedom was the subject of
much concern. I spoke to my Uncle Bailie Morrison, telling him I just
felt like saying so and so, as this really was in my heart. He was an
orator himself and he spoke words of wisdom to me then.

"Just say that, Andra; nothing like saying just what you really feel."

It was a lesson in public speaking which I took to heart. There is one
rule I might suggest for youthful orators. When you stand up before an
audience reflect that there are before you only men and women. You
should speak to them as you speak to other men and women in daily
intercourse. If you are not trying to be something different from
yourself, there is no more occasion for embarrassment than if you were
talking in your office to a party of your own people--none whatever.
It is trying to be other than one's self that unmans one. Be your own
natural self and go ahead. I once asked Colonel Ingersoll, the most
effective public speaker I ever heard, to what he attributed his
power. "Avoid elocutionists like snakes," he said, "and be yourself."

[Illustration: AN AMERICAN FOUR-IN-HAND IN BRITAIN]

I spoke again at Dunfermline, July 27, 1881, when my mother laid the
foundation stone there of the first free library building I ever gave.
My father was one of five weavers who founded the earliest library in
the town by opening their own books to their neighbors. Dunfermline
named the building I gave "Carnegie Library." The architect asked for
my coat of arms. I informed him I had none, but suggested that above
the door there might be carved a rising sun shedding its rays with the
motto: "Let there be light." This he adopted.

We had come up to Dunfermline with a coaching party. When walking
through England in the year 1867 with George Lauder and Harry Phipps I
had formed the idea of coaching from Brighton to Inverness with a
party of my dearest friends. The time had come for the long-promised
trip, and in the spring of 1881 we sailed from New York, a party of
eleven, to enjoy one of the happiest excursions of my life. It was one
of the holidays from business that kept me young and happy--worth all
the medicine in the world.

All the notes I made of the coaching trip were a few lines a day in
twopenny pass-books bought before we started. As with "Round the
World," I thought that I might some day write a magazine article, or
give some account of my excursion for those who accompanied me; but
one wintry day I decided that it was scarcely worth while to go down
to the New York office, three miles distant, and the question was how
I should occupy the spare time. I thought of the coaching trip, and
decided to write a few lines just to see how I should get on. The
narrative flowed freely, and before the day was over I had written
between three and four thousand words. I took up the pleasing task
every stormy day when it was unnecessary for me to visit the office,
and in exactly twenty sittings I had finished a book. I handed the
notes to Scribner's people and asked them to print a few hundred
copies for private circulation. The volume pleased my friends, as
"Round the World" had done. Mr. Champlin one day told me that Mr.
Scribner had read the book and would like very much to publish it for
general circulation upon his own account, subject to a royalty.

The vain author is easily persuaded that what he has done is
meritorious, and I consented. [Every year this still nets me a small
sum in royalties. And thirty years have gone by, 1912.] The letters I
received upon the publication[37] of it were so numerous and some so
gushing that my people saved them and they are now bound together in
scrapbook form, to which additions are made from time to time. The
number of invalids who have been pleased to write me, stating that the
book had brightened their lives, has been gratifying. Its reception in
Britain was cordial; the "Spectator" gave it a favorable review. But
any merit that the book has comes, I am sure, from the total absence
of effort on my part to make an impression. I wrote for my friends;
and what one does easily, one does well. I reveled in the writing of
the book, as I had in the journey itself.

[Footnote 37: Published privately in 1882 under the title _Our
Coaching Trip, Brighton to Inverness_. Published by the Scribners in
1883 under the title of _An American Four-in-Hand in Britain_.]

The year 1886 ended in deep gloom for me. My life as a happy careless
young man, with every want looked after, was over. I was left alone in
the world. My mother and brother passed away in November, within a few
days of each other, while I lay in bed under a severe attack of
typhoid fever, unable to move and, perhaps fortunately, unable to
feel the full weight of the catastrophe, being myself face to face
with death.

I was the first stricken, upon returning from a visit in the East to
our cottage at Cresson Springs on top of the Alleghanies where my
mother and I spent our happy summers. I had been quite unwell for a
day or two before leaving New York. A physician being summoned, my
trouble was pronounced typhoid fever. Professor Dennis was called from
New York and he corroborated the diagnosis. An attendant physician and
trained nurse were provided at once. Soon after my mother broke down
and my brother in Pittsburgh also was reported ill.

I was despaired of, I was so low, and then my whole nature seemed to
change. I became reconciled, indulged in pleasing meditations, was
without the slightest pain. My mother's and brother's serious
condition had not been revealed to me, and when I was informed that
both had left me forever it seemed only natural that I should follow
them. We had never been separated; why should we be now? But it was
decreed otherwise.

I recovered slowly and the future began to occupy my thoughts. There
was only one ray of hope and comfort in it. Toward that my thoughts
always turned. For several years I had known Miss Louise Whitfield.
Her mother permitted her to ride with me in the Central Park. We were
both very fond of riding. Other young ladies were on my list. I had
fine horses and often rode in the Park and around New York with one or
the other of the circle. In the end the others all faded into ordinary
beings. Miss Whitfield remained alone as the perfect one beyond any I
had met. Finally I began to find and admit to myself that she stood
the supreme test I had applied to several fair ones in my time. She
alone did so of all I had ever known. I could recommend young men to
apply this test before offering themselves. If they can honestly
believe the following lines, as I did, then all is well:

    "Full many a lady
    I've eyed with best regard: for several virtues
    Have I liked several women, never any
    With so full soul, but some defect in her
    Did quarrel with the noblest grace she owed,
    And put it to the foil; but you, O you,
    So perfect and so peerless are created
    Of every creature's best."[38]

[Footnote 38: Ferdinand to Miranda in _The Tempest_.]

In my soul I could echo those very words. To-day, after twenty years
of life with her, if I could find stronger words I could truthfully
use them.

My advances met with indifferent success. She was not without other
and younger admirers. My wealth and future plans were against me. I
was rich and had everything and she felt she could be of little use or
benefit to me. Her ideal was to be the real helpmeet of a young,
struggling man to whom she could and would be indispensable, as her
mother had been to her father. The care of her own family had largely
fallen upon her after her father's death when she was twenty-one. She
was now twenty-eight; her views of life were formed. At times she
seemed more favorable and we corresponded. Once, however, she returned
my letters saying she felt she must put aside all thought of accepting
me.

Professor and Mrs. Dennis took me from Cresson to their own home in
New York, as soon as I could be removed, and I lay there some time
under the former's personal supervision. Miss Whitfield called to see
me, for I had written her the first words from Cresson I was able
to write. She saw now that I needed her. I was left alone in the
world. Now she could be in every sense the "helpmeet." Both her heart
and head were now willing and the day was fixed. We were married in
New York April 22, 1887, and sailed for our honeymoon which was passed
on the Isle of Wight.

[Illustration: ANDREW CARNEGIE

(ABOUT 1878)]

Her delight was intense in finding the wild flowers. She had read of
Wandering Willie, Heartsease, Forget-me-nots, the Primrose, Wild
Thyme, and the whole list of homely names that had been to her only
names till now. Everything charmed her. Uncle Lauder and one of my
cousins came down from Scotland and visited us, and then we soon
followed to the residence at Kilgraston they had selected for us in
which to spend the summer. Scotland captured her. There was no doubt
about that. Her girlish reading had been of Scotland--Scott's novels
and "Scottish Chiefs" being her favorites. She soon became more Scotch
than I. All this was fulfilling my fondest dreams.

We spent some days in Dunfermline and enjoyed them much. The haunts
and incidents of my boyhood were visited and recited to her by all and
sundry. She got nothing but flattering accounts of her husband which
gave me a good start with her.

I was presented with the Freedom of Edinburgh as we passed
northward--Lord Rosebery making the speech. The crowd in Edinburgh was
great. I addressed the working-men in the largest hall and received a
present from them as did Mrs. Carnegie also--a brooch she values
highly. She heard and saw the pipers in all their glory and begged
there should be one at our home--a piper to walk around and waken us
in the morning and also to play us in to dinner. American as she is to
the core, and Connecticut Puritan at that, she declared that if
condemned to live upon a lonely island and allowed to choose only one
musical instrument, it would be the pipes. The piper was secured
quickly enough. One called and presented credentials from Cluny
McPherson. We engaged him and were preceded by him playing the pipes
as we entered our Kilgraston house.

We enjoyed Kilgraston, although Mrs. Carnegie still longed for a
wilder and more Highland home. Matthew Arnold visited us, as did Mr.
and Mrs. Blaine, Senator and Mrs. Eugene Hale, and many friends.[39]
Mrs. Carnegie would have my relatives up from Dunfermline, especially
the older uncles and aunties. She charmed every one. They expressed
their surprise to me that she ever married me, but I told them I was
equally surprised. The match had evidently been predestined.

[Footnote 39: John Hay, writing to his friend Henry Adams under date
of London, August 25, 1887, has the following to say about the party
at Kilgraston: "After that we went to Andy Carnegie in Perthshire, who
is keeping his honeymoon, having just married a pretty girl.... The
house is thronged with visitors--sixteen when we came away--we merely
stayed three days: the others were there for a fortnight. Among them
were your friends Blaine and Hale of Maine. Carnegie likes it so well
he is going to do it every summer and is looking at all the great
estates in the County with a view of renting or purchasing. We went
with him one day to Dupplin Castle, where I saw the most beautiful
trees I ever beheld in my wandering life. The old Earl of ---- is
miserably poor--not able to buy a bottle of seltzer--with an estate
worth millions in the hands of his creditors, and sure to be sold one
of these days to some enterprising Yankee or British Buttonmaker. I
wish you or Carnegie would buy it. I would visit you frequently."
(Thayer, _Life and Letters of John Hay_, vol. II, p. 74.)]

We took our piper with us when we returned to New York, and also our
housekeeper and some of the servants. Mrs. Nicoll remains with us
still and is now, after twenty years' faithful service, as a member of
the family. George Irvine, our butler, came to us a year later and is
also as one of us. Maggie Anderson, one of the servants, is the same.
They are devoted people, of high character and true loyalty.[40]

[Footnote 40: "No man is a true gentleman who does not inspire the
affection and devotion of his servants." (_Problems of To-day_, by
Andrew Carnegie. New York, 1908, p. 59.)]

The next year we were offered and took Cluny Castle. Our piper was
just the man to tell us all about it. He had been born and bred there
and perhaps influenced our selection of that residence where we spent
several summers.

On March 30, 1897, there came to us our daughter. As I first gazed
upon her Mrs. Carnegie said,

"Her name is Margaret after your mother. Now one request I have to
make."

"What is it, Lou?"

"We must get a summer home since this little one has been given us. We
cannot rent one and be obliged to go in and go out at a certain date.
It should be our home."

"Yes," I agreed.

"I make only one condition."

"What is that?" I asked.

"It must be in the Highlands of Scotland."

"Bless you," was my reply. "That suits me. You know I have to keep out
of the sun's rays, and where can we do that so surely as among the
heather? I'll be a committee of one to inquire and report."

Skibo Castle was the result.

It is now twenty years since Mrs. Carnegie entered and changed my
life, a few months after the passing of my mother and only brother
left me alone in the world. My life has been made so happy by her that
I cannot imagine myself living without her guardianship. I thought I
knew her when she stood Ferdinand's test,[41] but it was only the
surface of her qualities I had seen and felt. Of their purity,
holiness, wisdom, I had not sounded the depth. In every emergency of
our active, changing, and in later years somewhat public life, in all
her relations with others, including my family and her own, she has
proved the diplomat and peace-maker. Peace and good-will attend her
footsteps wherever her blessed influence extends. In the rare
instances demanding heroic action it is she who first realizes this
and plays the part.

[Footnote 41: The reference is to the quotation from _The Tempest_ on
page 214.]

The Peace-Maker has never had a quarrel in all her life, not even with
a schoolmate, and there does not live a soul upon the earth who has
met her who has the slightest cause to complain of neglect. Not that
she does not welcome the best and gently avoid the undesirable--none
is more fastidious than she--but neither rank, wealth, nor social
position affects her one iota. She is incapable of acting or speaking
rudely; all is in perfect good taste. Still, she never lowers the
standard. Her intimates are only of the best. She is always thinking
how she can do good to those around her--planning for this one and
that in case of need and making such judicious arrangements or
presents as surprise those coöperating with her.

I cannot imagine myself going through these twenty years without her.
Nor can I endure the thought of living after her. In the course of
nature I have not that to meet; but then the thought of what will be
cast upon her, a woman left alone with so much requiring attention and
needing a man to decide, gives me intense pain and I sometimes wish I
had this to endure for her. But then she will have our blessed
daughter in her life and perhaps that will keep her patient. Besides,
Margaret needs her more than she does her father.

[Illustration: MARGARET CARNEGIE AT FIFTEEN]

Why, oh, why, are we compelled to leave the heaven we have found on
earth and go we know not where! For I can say with Jessica:

            "It is very meet
    The Lord Bassanio live an upright life;
    For, having such a blessing in his lady,
    He finds the joys of heaven here on earth."




CHAPTER XVI

MILLS AND THE MEN


The one vital lesson in iron and steel that I learned in Britain was
the necessity for owning raw materials and finishing the completed
article ready for its purpose. Having solved the steel-rail problem at
the Edgar Thomson Works, we soon proceeded to the next step. The
difficulties and uncertainties of obtaining regular supplies of pig
iron compelled us to begin the erection of blast furnaces. Three of
these were built, one, however, being a reconstructed blast furnace
purchased from the Escanaba Iron Company, with which Mr. Kloman had
been connected. As is usual in such cases, the furnace cost us as much
as a new one, and it never was as good. There is nothing so
unsatisfactory as purchases of inferior plants.

But although this purchase was a mistake, directly considered, it
proved, at a subsequent date, a source of great profit because it gave
us a furnace small enough for the manufacture of spiegel and, at a
later date, of ferro-manganese. We were the second firm in the United
States to manufacture our own spiegel, and the first, and for years
the only, firm in America that made ferro-manganese. We had been
dependent upon foreigners for a supply of this indispensable article,
paying as high as eighty dollars a ton for it. The manager of our
blast furnaces, Mr. Julian Kennedy, is entitled to the credit of
suggesting that with the ores within reach we could make
ferro-manganese in our small furnace. The experiment was worth trying
and the result was a great success. We were able to supply the entire
American demand and prices fell from eighty to fifty dollars per ton
as a consequence.

While testing the ores of Virginia we found that these were being
quietly purchased by Europeans for ferro-manganese, the owners of the
mine being led to believe that they were used for other purposes. Our
Mr. Phipps at once set about purchasing that mine. He obtained an
option from the owners, who had neither capital nor skill to work it
efficiently. A high price was paid to them for their interests, and
(with one of them, Mr. Davis, a very able young man) we became the
owners, but not until a thorough investigation of the mine had proved
that there was enough of manganese ore in sight to repay us. All this
was done with speed; not a day was lost when the discovery was made.
And here lies the great advantage of a partnership over a corporation.
The president of the latter would have had to consult a board of
directors and wait several weeks and perhaps months for their
decision. By that time the mine would probably have become the
property of others.

We continued to develop our blast-furnace plant, every new one being a
great improvement upon the preceding, until at last we thought we had
arrived at a standard furnace. Minor improvements would no doubt be
made, but so far as we could see we had a perfect plant and our
capacity was then fifty thousand tons per month of pig iron.

The blast-furnace department was no sooner added than another step was
seen to be essential to our independence and success. The supply of
superior coke was a fixed quantity--the Connellsville field being
defined. We found that we could not get on without a supply of the
fuel essential to the smelting of pig iron; and a very thorough
investigation of the question led us to the conclusion that the Frick
Coke Company had not only the best coal and coke property, but that it
had in Mr. Frick himself a man with a positive genius for its
management. He had proved his ability by starting as a poor railway
clerk and succeeding. In 1882 we purchased one half of the stock of
this company, and by subsequent purchases from other holders we became
owners of the great bulk of the shares.

There now remained to be acquired only the supply of iron stone. If we
could obtain this we should be in the position occupied by only two or
three of the European concerns. We thought at one time we had
succeeded in discovering in Pennsylvania this last remaining link in
the chain. We were misled, however, in our investment in the Tyrone
region, and lost considerable sums as the result of our attempts to
mine and use the ores of that section. They promised well at the edges
of the mines, where the action of the weather for ages had washed away
impurities and enriched the ore, but when we penetrated a small
distance they proved too "lean" to work.

Our chemist, Mr. Prousser, was then sent to a Pennsylvania furnace
among the hills which we had leased, with instructions to analyze all
the materials brought to him from the district, and to encourage
people to bring him specimens of minerals. A striking example of the
awe inspired by the chemist in those days was that only with great
difficulty could he obtain a man or a boy to assist him in the
laboratory. He was suspected of illicit intercourse with the Powers of
Evil when he undertook to tell by his suspicious-looking apparatus
what a stone contained. I believe that at last we had to send him a
man from our office at Pittsburgh.

One day he sent us a report of analyses of ore remarkable for the
absence of phosphorus. It was really an ore suitable for making
Bessemer steel. Such a discovery attracted our attention at once. The
owner of the property was Moses Thompson, a rich farmer, proprietor of
seven thousand acres of the most beautiful agricultural land in Center
County, Pennsylvania. An appointment was made to meet him upon the
ground from which the ore had been obtained. We found the mine had
been worked for a charcoal blast furnace fifty or sixty years before,
but it had not borne a good reputation then, the reason no doubt being
that its product was so much purer than other ores that the same
amount of flux used caused trouble in smelting. It was so good it was
good for nothing in those days of old.

We finally obtained the right to take the mine over at any time within
six months, and we therefore began the work of examination, which
every purchaser of mineral property should make most carefully. We ran
lines across the hillside fifty feet apart, with cross-lines at
distances of a hundred feet apart, and at each point of intersection
we put a shaft down through the ore. I believe there were eighty such
shafts in all and the ore was analyzed at every few feet of depth, so
that before we paid over the hundred thousand dollars asked we knew
exactly what there was of ore. The result hoped for was more than
realized. Through the ability of my cousin and partner, Mr. Lauder,
the cost of mining and washing was reduced to a low figure, and the
Scotia ore made good all the losses we had incurred in the other
mines, paid for itself, and left a profit besides. In this case, at
least, we snatched victory from the jaws of defeat. We trod upon sure
ground with the chemist as our guide. It will be seen that we were
determined to get raw materials and were active in the pursuit.

We had lost and won, but the escapes in business affairs are sometimes
very narrow. Driving with Mr. Phipps from the mills one day we passed
the National Trust Company office on Penn Street, Pittsburgh. I
noticed the large gilt letters across the window, "Stockholders
individually liable." That very morning in looking over a statement of
our affairs I had noticed twenty shares "National Trust Company" on
the list of assets. I said to Harry:

"If this is the concern we own shares in, won't you please sell them
before you return to the office this afternoon?"

He saw no need for haste. It would be done in good time.

"No, Harry, oblige me by doing it instantly."

He did so and had it transferred. Fortunate, indeed, was this, for in
a short time the bank failed with an enormous deficit. My cousin, Mr.
Morris, was among the ruined shareholders. Many others met the same
fate. Times were panicky, and had we been individually liable for all
the debts of the National Trust Company our credit would inevitably
have been seriously imperiled. It was a narrow escape. And with only
twenty shares (two thousand dollars' worth of stock), taken to oblige
friends who wished our name on their list of shareholders! The lesson
was not lost. The sound rule in business is that you may give money
freely when you have a surplus, but your name never--neither as
endorser nor as member of a corporation with individual liability. A
trifling investment of a few thousand dollars, a mere trifle--yes, but
a trifle possessed of deadly explosive power.

The rapid substitution of steel for iron in the immediate future had
become obvious to us. Even in our Keystone Bridge Works, steel was
being used more and more in place of iron. King Iron was about to be
deposed by the new King Steel, and we were becoming more and more
dependent upon it. We had about concluded in 1886 to build alongside
of the Edgar Thomson Mills new works for the manufacture of
miscellaneous shapes of steel when it was suggested to us that the
five or six leading manufacturers of Pittsburgh, who had combined to
build steel mills at Homestead, were willing to sell their mills to
us.

These works had been built originally by a syndicate of manufacturers,
with the view of obtaining the necessary supplies of steel which they
required in their various concerns, but the steel-rail business, being
then in one of its booms, they had been tempted to change plans and
construct a steel-rail mill. They had been able to make rails as long
as prices remained high, but, as the mills had not been specially
designed for this purpose, they were without the indispensable blast
furnaces for the supply of pig iron, and had no coke lands for the
supply of fuel. They were in no condition to compete with us.

It was advantageous for us to purchase these works. I felt there was
only one way we could deal with their owners, and that was to propose
a consolidation with Carnegie Brothers & Co. We offered to do so on
equal terms, every dollar they had invested to rank against our
dollars. Upon this basis the negotiation was promptly concluded. We,
however, gave to all parties the option to take cash, and most
fortunately for us, all elected to do so except Mr. George Singer, who
continued with us to his and our entire satisfaction. Mr. Singer told
us afterwards that his associates had been greatly exercised as to how
they could meet the proposition I was to lay before them. They were
much afraid of being overreached but when I proposed equality all
around, dollar for dollar, they were speechless.

This purchase led to the reconstruction of all our firms. The new firm
of Carnegie, Phipps & Co. was organized in 1886 to run the Homestead
Mills. The firm of Wilson, Walker & Co. was embraced in the firm of
Carnegie, Phipps & Co., Mr. Walker being elected chairman. My brother
was chairman of Carnegie Brothers & Co. and at the head of all. A
further extension of our business was the establishing of the Hartman
Steel Works at Beaver Falls, designed to work into a hundred various
forms the product of the Homestead Mills. So now we made almost
everything in steel from a wire nail up to a twenty-inch steel girder,
and it was then not thought probable that we should enter into any new
field.

It may be interesting here to note the progress of our works during
the decade 1888 to 1897. In 1888 we had twenty millions of dollars
invested; in 1897 more than double or over forty-five millions. The
600,000 tons of pig iron we made per annum in 1888 was trebled; we
made nearly 2,000,000. Our product of iron and steel was in 1888, say,
2000 tons per day; it grew to exceed 6000 tons. Our coke works then
embraced about 5000 ovens; they were trebled in number, and our
capacity, then 6000 tons, became 18,000 tons per day. Our Frick Coke
Company in 1897 had 42,000 acres of coal land, more than two thirds of
the true Connellsville vein. Ten years hence increased production may
be found to have been equally rapid. It may be accepted as an axiom
that a manufacturing concern in a growing country like ours begins to
decay when it stops extending.

To make a ton of steel one and a half tons of iron stone has to be
mined, transported by rail a hundred miles to the Lakes, carried by
boat hundreds of miles, transferred to cars, transported by rail one
hundred and fifty miles to Pittsburgh; one and a half tons of coal
must be mined and manufactured into coke and carried fifty-odd miles
by rail; and one ton of limestone mined and carried one hundred and
fifty miles to Pittsburgh. How then could steel be manufactured and
sold without loss at three pounds for two cents? This, I confess,
seemed to me incredible, and little less than miraculous, but it was
so.

America is soon to change from being the dearest steel manufacturing
country to the cheapest. Already the shipyards of Belfast are our
customers. This is but the beginning. Under present conditions America
can produce steel as cheaply as any other land, notwithstanding its
higher-priced labor. There is no labor so cheap as the dearest in the
mechanical field, provided it is free, contented, zealous, and reaping
reward as it renders service. And here America leads.

One great advantage which America will have in competing in the
markets of the world is that her manufacturers will have the best home
market. Upon this they can depend for a return upon capital, and the
surplus product can be exported with advantage, even when the prices
received for it do not more than cover actual cost, provided the
exports be charged with their proportion of all expenses. The nation
that has the best home market, especially if products are
standardized, as ours are, can soon outsell the foreign producer. The
phrase I used in Britain in this connection was: "The Law of the
Surplus." It afterward came into general use in commercial
discussions.




CHAPTER XVII

THE HOMESTEAD STRIKE


While upon the subject of our manufacturing interests, I may record
that on July 1, 1892, during my absence in the Highlands of Scotland,
there occurred the one really serious quarrel with our workmen in our
whole history. For twenty-six years I had been actively in charge of
the relations between ourselves and our men, and it was the pride of
my life to think how delightfully satisfactory these had been and
were. I hope I fully deserved what my chief partner, Mr. Phipps, said
in his letter to the "New York Herald," January 30, 1904, in reply to
one who had declared I had remained abroad during the Homestead
strike, instead of flying back to support my partners. It was to the
effect that "I was always disposed to yield to the demands of the men,
however unreasonable"; hence one or two of my partners did not wish me
to return.[42] Taking no account of the reward that comes from
feeling that you and your employees are friends and judging only from
economical results, I believe that higher wages to men who respect
their employers and are happy and contented are a good investment,
yielding, indeed, big dividends.

[Footnote 42: The full statement of Mr. Phipps is as follows:

_Question:_ "It was stated that Mr. Carnegie acted in a cowardly
manner in not returning to America from Scotland and being present
when the strike was in progress at Homestead."

_Answer:_ "When Mr. Carnegie heard of the trouble at Homestead he
immediately wired that he would take the first ship for America, but
his partners begged him not to appear, as they were of the opinion
that the welfare of the Company required that he should not be in this
country at the time. They knew of his extreme disposition to always
grant the demands of labor, however unreasonable.

"I have never known of any one interested in the business to make any
complaint about Mr. Carnegie's absence at that time, but all the
partners rejoiced that they were permitted to manage the affair in
their own way." (Henry Phipps in the _New York Herald_, January 30,
1904.)]

The manufacture of steel was revolutionized by the Bessemer
open-hearth and basic inventions. The machinery hitherto employed had
become obsolete, and our firm, recognizing this, spent several
millions at Homestead reconstructing and enlarging the works. The new
machinery made about sixty per cent more steel than the old. Two
hundred and eighteen tonnage men (that is, men who were paid by the
ton of steel produced) were working under a three years' contract,
part of the last year being with the new machinery. Thus their
earnings had increased almost sixty per cent before the end of the
contract.

The firm offered to divide this sixty per cent with them in the new
scale to be made thereafter. That is to say, the earnings of the men
would have been thirty per cent greater than under the old scale and
the other thirty per cent would have gone to the firm to recompense it
for its outlay. The work of the men would not have been much harder
than it had been hitherto, as the improved machinery did the work.
This was not only fair and liberal, it was generous, and under
ordinary circumstances would have been accepted by the men with
thanks. But the firm was then engaged in making armor for the United
States Government, which we had declined twice to manufacture and
which was urgently needed. It had also the contract to furnish
material for the Chicago Exhibition. Some of the leaders of the men,
knowing these conditions, insisted upon demanding the whole sixty per
cent, thinking the firm would be compelled to give it. The firm could
not agree, nor should it have agreed to such an attempt as this to
take it by the throat and say, "Stand and deliver." It very rightly
declined. Had I been at home nothing would have induced me to yield to
this unfair attempt to extort.

Up to this point all had been right enough. The policy I had pursued
in cases of difference with our men was that of patiently waiting,
reasoning with them, and showing them that their demands were unfair;
but never attempting to employ new men in their places--never. The
superintendent of Homestead, however, was assured by the three
thousand men who were not concerned in the dispute that they could run
the works, and were anxious to rid themselves of the two hundred and
eighteen men who had banded themselves into a union and into which
they had hitherto refused to admit those in other departments--only
the "heaters" and "rollers" of steel being eligible.

My partners were misled by this superintendent, who was himself
misled. He had not had great experience in such affairs, having
recently been promoted from a subordinate position. The unjust demands
of the few union men, and the opinion of the three thousand non-union
men that they were unjust, very naturally led him into thinking there
would be no trouble and that the workmen would do as they had
promised. There were many men among the three thousand who could take,
and wished to take, the places of the two hundred and eighteen--at
least so it was reported to me.

It is easy to look back and say that the vital step of opening the
works should never have been taken. All the firm had to do was to say
to the men: "There is a labor dispute here and you must settle it
between yourselves. The firm has made you a most liberal offer. The
works will run when the dispute is adjusted, and not till then.
Meanwhile your places remain open to you." Or, it might have been well
if the superintendent had said to the three thousand men, "All right,
if you will come and run the works without protection," thus throwing
upon them the responsibility of protecting themselves--three thousand
men as against two hundred and eighteen. Instead of this it was
thought advisable (as an additional precaution by the state officials,
I understand) to have the sheriff with guards to protect the thousands
against the hundreds. The leaders of the latter were violent and
aggressive men; they had guns and pistols, and, as was soon proved,
were able to intimidate the thousands.

I quote what I once laid down in writing as our rule: "My idea is that
the Company should be known as determined to let the men at any works
stop work; that it will confer freely with them and wait patiently
until they decide to return to work, never thinking of trying new
men--never." The best men as men, and the best workmen, are not
walking the streets looking for work. Only the inferior class as a
rule is idle. The kind of men we desired are rarely allowed to lose
their jobs, even in dull times. It is impossible to get new men to run
successfully the complicated machinery of a modern steel plant. The
attempt to put in new men converted the thousands of old men who
desired to work, into lukewarm supporters of our policy, for workmen
can always be relied upon to resent the employment of new men. Who can
blame them?

If I had been at home, however, I might have been persuaded to open
the works, as the superintendent desired, to test whether our old men
would go to work as they had promised. But it should be noted that
the works were not opened at first by my partners for new men. On the
contrary, it was, as I was informed upon my return, at the wish of the
thousands of our old men that they were opened. This is a vital point.
My partners were in no way blamable for making the trial so
recommended by the superintendent. Our rule never to employ new men,
but to wait for the old to return, had not been violated so far. In
regard to the second opening of the works, after the strikers had shot
the sheriff's officers, it is also easy to look back and say, "How
much better had the works been closed until the old men voted to
return"; but the Governor of Pennsylvania, with eight thousand troops,
had meanwhile taken charge of the situation.

I was traveling in the Highlands of Scotland when the trouble arose,
and did not hear of it until two days after. Nothing I have ever had
to meet in all my life, before or since, wounded me so deeply. No
pangs remain of any wound received in my business career save that of
Homestead. It was so unnecessary. The men were outrageously wrong. The
strikers, with the new machinery, would have made from four to nine
dollars a day under the new scale--thirty per cent more than they were
making with the old machinery. While in Scotland I received the
following cable from the officers of the union of our workmen:

"Kind master, tell us what you wish us to do and we shall do it for
you."

This was most touching, but, alas, too late. The mischief was done,
the works were in the hands of the Governor; it was too late.

I received, while abroad, numerous kind messages from friends
conversant with the circumstances, who imagined my unhappiness. The
following from Mr. Gladstone was greatly appreciated:

     MY DEAR MR. CARNEGIE,

     My wife has long ago offered her thanks, with my own, for
     your most kind congratulations. But I do not forget that you
     have been suffering yourself from anxieties, and have been
     exposed to imputations in connection with your gallant
     efforts to direct rich men into a course of action more
     enlightened than that which they usually follow. I wish I
     could relieve you from these imputations of journalists, too
     often rash, conceited or censorious, rancorous, ill-natured.
     I wish to do the little, the very little, that is in my
     power, which is simply to say how sure I am that no one who
     knows you will be prompted by the unfortunate occurrences
     across the water (of which manifestly we cannot know the
     exact merits) to qualify in the slightest degree either his
     confidence in your generous views or his admiration of the
     good and great work you have already done.

     Wealth is at present like a monster threatening to swallow
     up the moral life of man; you by precept and by example have
     been teaching him to disgorge. I for one thank you.

     Believe me

     Very faithfully yours

     (Signed) W.E. GLADSTONE

I insert this as giving proof, if proof were needed, of Mr.
Gladstone's large, sympathetic nature, alive and sensitive to
everything transpiring of a nature to arouse sympathy--Neapolitans,
Greeks, and Bulgarians one day, or a stricken friend the next.

The general public, of course, did not know that I was in Scotland and
knew nothing of the initial trouble at Homestead. Workmen had been
killed at the Carnegie Works, of which I was the controlling owner.
That was sufficient to make my name a by-word for years. But at last
some satisfaction came. Senator Hanna was president of the National
Civic Federation, a body composed of capitalists and workmen which
exerted a benign influence over both employers and employed, and the
Honorable Oscar Straus, who was then vice-president, invited me to
dine at his house and meet the officials of the Federation. Before the
date appointed Mark Hanna, its president, my lifelong friend and
former agent at Cleveland, had suddenly passed away. I attended the
dinner. At its close Mr. Straus arose and said that the question of a
successor to Mr. Hanna had been considered, and he had to report that
every labor organization heard from had favored me for the position.
There were present several of the labor leaders who, one after
another, arose and corroborated Mr. Straus.

I do not remember so complete a surprise and, I shall confess, one so
grateful to me. That I deserved well from labor I felt. I knew myself
to be warmly sympathetic with the working-man, and also that I had the
regard of our own workmen; but throughout the country it was naturally
the reverse, owing to the Homestead riot. The Carnegie Works meant to
the public Mr. Carnegie's war upon labor's just earnings.

I arose to explain to the officials at the Straus dinner that I could
not possibly accept the great honor, because I had to escape the heat
of summer and the head of the Federation must be on hand at all
seasons ready to grapple with an outbreak, should one occur. My
embarrassment was great, but I managed to let all understand that this
was felt to be the most welcome tribute I could have received--a balm
to the hurt mind. I closed by saying that if elected to my lamented
friend's place upon the Executive Committee I should esteem it an
honor to serve. To this position I was elected by unanimous vote. I
was thus relieved from the feeling that I was considered responsible
by labor generally, for the Homestead riot and the killing of workmen.

I owe this vindication to Mr. Oscar Straus, who had read my articles
and speeches of early days upon labor questions, and who had quoted
these frequently to workmen. The two labor leaders of the Amalgamated
Union, White and Schaeffer from Pittsburgh, who were at this dinner,
were also able and anxious to enlighten their fellow-workmen members
of the Board as to my record with labor, and did not fail to do so.

A mass meeting of the workmen and their wives was afterwards held in
the Library Hall at Pittsburgh to greet me, and I addressed them from
both my head and my heart. The one sentence I remember, and always
shall, was to the effect that capital, labor, and employer were a
three-legged stool, none before or after the others, all equally
indispensable. Then came the cordial hand-shaking and all was well.
Having thus rejoined hands and hearts with our employees and their
wives, I felt that a great weight had been effectually lifted, but I
had had a terrible experience although thousands of miles from the
scene.

An incident flowing from the Homestead trouble is told by my friend,
Professor John C. Van Dyke, of Rutgers College.

     In the spring of 1900, I went up from Guaymas, on the Gulf
     of California, to the ranch of a friend at La Noria Verde,
     thinking to have a week's shooting in the mountains of
     Sonora. The ranch was far enough removed from civilization,
     and I had expected meeting there only a few Mexicans and
     many Yaqui Indians, but much to my surprise I found an
     English-speaking man, who proved to be an American. I did
     not have long to wait in order to find out what brought him
     there, for he was very lonesome and disposed to talk. His
     name was McLuckie, and up to 1892 he had been a skilled
     mechanic in the employ of the Carnegie Steel Works at
     Homestead. He was what was called a "top hand," received
     large wages, was married, and at that time had a home and
     considerable property. In addition, he had been honored by
     his fellow-townsmen and had been made burgomaster of
     Homestead.

     When the strike of 1892 came McLuckie naturally sided with
     the strikers, and in his capacity as burgomaster gave the
     order to arrest the Pinkerton detectives who had come to
     Homestead by steamer to protect the works and preserve
     order. He believed he was fully justified in doing this. As
     he explained it to me, the detectives were an armed force
     invading his bailiwick, and he had a right to arrest and
     disarm them. The order led to bloodshed, and the conflict
     was begun in real earnest.

     The story of the strike is, of course, well known to all.
     The strikers were finally defeated. As for McLuckie, he was
     indicted for murder, riot, treason, and I know not what
     other offenses. He was compelled to flee from the State, was
     wounded, starved, pursued by the officers of the law, and
     obliged to go into hiding until the storm blew over. Then he
     found that he was blacklisted by all the steel men in the
     United States and could not get employment anywhere. His
     money was gone, and, as a final blow, his wife died and his
     home was broken up. After many vicissitudes he resolved to
     go to Mexico, and at the time I met him he was trying to get
     employment in the mines about fifteen miles from La Noria
     Verde. But he was too good a mechanic for the Mexicans, who
     required in mining the cheapest kind of unskilled peon
     labor. He could get nothing to do and had no money. He was
     literally down to his last copper. Naturally, as he told the
     story of his misfortunes, I felt very sorry for him,
     especially as he was a most intelligent person and did no
     unnecessary whining about his troubles.

     I do not think I told him at the time that I knew Mr.
     Carnegie and had been with him at Cluny in Scotland shortly
     after the Homestead strike, nor that I knew from Mr.
     Carnegie the other side of the story. But McLuckie was
     rather careful not to blame Mr. Carnegie, saying to me
     several times that if "Andy" had been there the trouble
     would never have arisen. He seemed to think "the boys"
     could get on very well with "Andy" but not so well with some
     of his partners.

     I was at the ranch for a week and saw a good deal of
     McLuckie in the evenings. When I left there, I went directly
     to Tucson, Arizona, and from there I had occasion to write
     to Mr. Carnegie, and in the letter I told him about meeting
     with McLuckie. I added that I felt very sorry for the man
     and thought he had been treated rather badly. Mr. Carnegie
     answered at once, and on the margin of the letter wrote in
     lead pencil: "Give McLuckie all the money he wants, but
     don't mention my name." I wrote to McLuckie immediately,
     offering him what money he needed, mentioning no sum, but
     giving him to understand that it would be sufficient to put
     him on his feet again. He declined it. He said he would
     fight it out and make his own way, which was the
     right-enough American spirit. I could not help but admire it
     in him.

     As I remember now, I spoke about him later to a friend, Mr.
     J.A. Naugle, the general manager of the Sonora Railway. At
     any rate, McLuckie got a job with the railway at driving
     wells, and made a great success of it. A year later, or
     perhaps it was in the autumn of the same year, I again met
     him at Guaymas, where he was superintending some repairs on
     his machinery at the railway shops. He was much changed for
     the better, seemed happy, and to add to his contentment, had
     taken unto himself a Mexican wife. And now that his sky was
     cleared, I was anxious to tell him the truth about my offer
     that he might not think unjustly of those who had been
     compelled to fight him. So before I left him, I said,

     "McLuckie, I want you to know now that the money I offered
     you was not mine. That was Andrew Carnegie's money. It was
     his offer, made through me."

     McLuckie was fairly stunned, and all he could say was:

     "Well, that was damned white of Andy, wasn't it?"

I would rather risk that verdict of McLuckie's as a passport to
Paradise than all the theological dogmas invented by man. I knew
McLuckie well as a good fellow. It was said his property in Homestead
was worth thirty thousand dollars. He was under arrest for the
shooting of the police officers because he was the burgomaster, and
also the chairman of the Men's Committee of Homestead. He had to fly,
leaving all behind him.

After this story got into print, the following skit appeared in the
newspapers because I had declared I'd rather have McLuckie's few words
on my tombstone than any other inscription, for it indicated I had
been kind to one of our workmen:

"JUST BY THE WAY"

SANDY ON ANDY

Oh! hae ye heared what Andy's spiered to hae upo' his tomb,
When a' his gowd is gie'n awa an' Death has sealed his doom!
Nae Scriptur' line wi' tribute fine that dealers aye keep handy,
But juist this irreleegious screed--"That's damned white of Andy!"

The gude Scot laughs at epitaphs that are but meant to flatter,
But never are was sae profane, an' that's nae laughin' matter.
Yet, gin he gies his siller all awa, mon, he's a dandy,
An' we'll admit his right to it, for "That's damned white of Andy!"

There's not to be a "big, big D," an' then a dash thereafter,
For Andy would na spoil the word by trying to make it safter;
He's not the lad to juggle terms, or soothing speech to bandy.
A blunt, straightforward mon is he--an' "That's damned white of Andy!"

Sae when he's deid, we'll gie good heed, an' write it as he askit;
We'll carve it on his headstone an' we'll stamp it on his casket:
"Wha dees rich, dees disgraced," says he, an' sure's my name is Sandy,
'T wull be nae rich man that he'll dee--an' "That's damned white
  of Andy!"[43]

[Footnote 43: Mr. Carnegie was very fond of this story because, being
human, he was fond of applause and, being a Robert Burns radical, he
preferred the applause of Labor to that of Rank. That one of his men
thought he had acted "white" pleased him beyond measure. He stopped
short with that tribute and never asked, never knew, why or how the
story happened to be told. Perhaps this is the time and place to tell
the story of the story.

Sometime in 1901 over a dinner table in New York, I heard a statement
regarding Mr. Carnegie that he never gave anything without the
requirement that his name be attached to the gift. The remark came
from a prominent man who should have known he was talking nonsense. It
rather angered me. I denied the statement, saying that I, personally,
had given away money for Mr. Carnegie that only he and I knew about,
and that he had given many thousands in this way through others. By
way of illustration I told the story about McLuckie. A Pittsburgh man
at the table carried the story back to Pittsburgh, told it there, and
it finally got into the newspapers. Of course the argument of the
story, namely, that Mr. Carnegie sometimes gave without publicity, was
lost sight of and only the refrain, "It was damned white of Andy,"
remained. Mr. Carnegie never knew that there was an argument. He liked
the refrain. Some years afterward at Skibo (1906), when he was writing
this Autobiography, he asked me if I would not write out the story for
him. I did so. I am now glad of the chance to write an explanatory
note about it.... _John C. Van Dyke._]




CHAPTER XVIII

PROBLEMS OF LABOR


I should like to record here some of the labor disputes I have had to
deal with, as these may point a moral to both capital and labor.

The workers at the blast furnaces in our steel-rail works once sent in
a "round-robin" stating that unless the firm gave them an advance of
wages by Monday afternoon at four o'clock they would leave the
furnaces. Now, the scale upon which these men had agreed to work did
not lapse until the end of the year, several months off. I felt if men
would break an agreement there was no use in making a second agreement
with them, but nevertheless I took the night train from New York and
was at the works early in the morning.

I asked the superintendent to call together the three committees which
governed the works--not only the blast-furnace committee that was
alone involved, but the mill and the converting works committees as
well. They appeared and, of course, were received by me with great
courtesy, not because it was good policy to be courteous, but because
I have always enjoyed meeting our men. I am bound to say that the more
I know of working-men the higher I rate their virtues. But it is with
them as Barrie says with women: "Dootless the Lord made a' things
weel, but he left some michty queer kinks in women." They have their
prejudices and "red rags," which have to be respected, for the main
root of trouble is ignorance, not hostility. The committee sat in a
semicircle before me, all with their hats off, of course, as mine
was also; and really there was the appearance of a model assembly.

Addressing the chairman of the mill committee, I said:

"Mr. Mackay" (he was an old gentleman and wore spectacles), "have we
an agreement with you covering the remainder of the year?"

Taking the spectacles off slowly, and holding them in his hand, he
said:

"Yes, sir, you have, Mr. Carnegie, and you haven't got enough money to
make us break it either."

"There spoke the true American workman," I said. "I am proud of you."

"Mr. Johnson" (who was chairman of the rail converters' committee),
"have we a similar agreement with you?"

Mr. Johnson was a small, spare man; he spoke very deliberately:

"Mr. Carnegie, when an agreement is presented to me to sign, I read it
carefully, and if it don't suit me, I don't sign it, and if it does
suit me, I do sign it, and when I sign it I keep it."

"There again speaks the self-respecting American workman," I said.

Turning now to the chairman of the blast-furnaces committee, an
Irishman named Kelly, I addressed the same question to him:

"Mr. Kelly, have we an agreement with you covering the remainder of
this year?"

Mr. Kelly answered that he couldn't say exactly. There was a paper
sent round and he signed it, but didn't read it over carefully, and
didn't understand just what was in it. At this moment our
superintendent, Captain Jones, excellent manager, but impulsive,
exclaimed abruptly:

"Now, Mr. Kelly, you know I read that over twice and discussed it with
you!"

"Order, order, Captain! Mr. Kelly is entitled to give his explanation.
I sign many a paper that I do not read--documents our lawyers and
partners present to me to sign. Mr. Kelly states that he signed this
document under such circumstances and his statement must be received.
But, Mr. Kelly, I have always found that the best way is to carry out
the provisions of the agreement one signs carelessly and resolve to be
more careful next time. Would it not be better for you to continue
four months longer under this agreement, and then, when you sign the
next one, see that you understand it?"

There was no answer to this, and I arose and said:

"Gentlemen of the Blast-Furnace Committee, you have threatened our
firm that you will break your agreement and that you will leave these
blast furnaces (which means disaster) unless you get a favorable
answer to your threat by four o'clock to-day. It is not yet three, but
your answer is ready. You may leave the blast furnaces. The grass will
grow around them before we yield to your threat. The worst day that
labor has ever seen in this world is that day in which it dishonors
itself by breaking its agreement. You have your answer."

The committee filed out slowly and there was silence among the
partners. A stranger who was coming in on business met the committee
in the passage and he reported:

"As I came in, a man wearing spectacles pushed up alongside of an
Irishman he called Kelly, and he said: 'You fellows might just as well
understand it now as later. There's to be no d----d monkeying round
these works.'"

That meant business. Later we heard from one of our clerks what took
place at the furnaces. Kelly and his committee marched down to them.
Of course, the men were waiting and watching for the committee and a
crowd had gathered. When the furnaces were reached, Kelly called out
to them:

"Get to work, you spalpeens, what are you doing here? Begorra, the
little boss just hit from the shoulder. He won't fight, but he says he
has sat down, and begorra, we all know he'll be a skeleton afore he
rises. Get to work, ye spalpeens."

The Irish and Scotch-Irish are queer, but the easiest and best fellows
to get on with, if you only know how. That man Kelly was my stanch
friend and admirer ever afterward, and he was before that one of our
most violent men. My experience is that you can always rely upon the
great body of working-men to do what is right, provided they have not
taken up a position and promised their leaders to stand by them. But
their loyalty to their leaders even when mistaken, is something to
make us proud of them. Anything can be done with men who have this
feeling of loyalty within them. They only need to be treated fairly.

The way a strike was once broken at our steel-rail mills is
interesting. Here again, I am sorry to say, one hundred and
thirty-four men in one department had bound themselves under secret
oath to demand increased wages at the end of the year, several months
away. The new year proved very unfavorable for business, and other
iron and steel manufacturers throughout the country had effected
reductions in wages. Nevertheless, these men, having secretly sworn
months previously that they would not work unless they got increased
wages, thought themselves bound to insist upon their demands. We could
not advance wages when our competitors were reducing them, and the
works were stopped in consequence. Every department of the works was
brought to a stand by these strikers. The blast furnaces were
abandoned a day or two before the time agreed upon, and we were
greatly troubled in consequence.

I went to Pittsburgh and was surprised to find the furnaces had been
banked, contrary to agreement. I was to meet the men in the morning
upon arrival at Pittsburgh, but a message was sent to me from the
works stating that the men had "left the furnaces and would meet me
to-morrow." Here was a nice reception! My reply was:

"No they won't. Tell them I shall not be here to-morrow. Anybody can
stop work; the trick is to start it again. Some fine day these men
will want the works started and will be looking around for somebody
who can start them, and I will tell them then just what I do now: that
the works will never start except upon a sliding scale based upon the
prices we get for our products. That scale will last three years and
it will not be submitted by the men. They have submitted many scales
to us. It is our turn now, and we are going to submit a scale to them.

"Now," I said to my partners, "I am going back to New York in the
afternoon. Nothing more is to be done."

A short time after my message was received by the men they asked if
they could come in and see me that afternoon before I left.

I answered: "Certainly!"

They came in and I said to them:

"Gentlemen, your chairman here, Mr. Bennett, assured you that I would
make my appearance and settle with you in some way or other, as I
always have settled. That is true. And he told you that I would not
fight, which is also true. He is a true prophet. But he told you
something else in which he was slightly mistaken. He said I _could_
not fight. Gentlemen," looking Mr. Bennett straight in the eye and
closing and raising my fist, "he forgot that I was Scotch. But I will
tell you something; I will never fight you. I know better than to
fight labor. I will not fight, but I can beat any committee that was
ever made at sitting down, and I have sat down. These works will never
start until the men vote by a two-thirds majority to start them, and
then, as I told you this morning, they will start on our sliding
scale. I have nothing more to say."

They retired. It was about two weeks afterwards that one of the house
servants came to my library in New York with a card, and I found upon
it the names of two of our workmen, and also the name of a reverend
gentleman. The men said they were from the works at Pittsburgh and
would like to see me.

"Ask if either of these gentlemen belongs to the blast-furnace workers
who banked the furnaces contrary to agreement."

The man returned and said "No." I replied: "In that case go down and
tell them that I shall be pleased to have them come up."

Of course they were received with genuine warmth and cordiality and we
sat and talked about New York, for some time, this being their first
visit.

"Mr. Carnegie, we really came to talk about the trouble at the works,"
the minister said at last.

"Oh, indeed!" I answered. "Have the men voted?"

"No," he said.

My rejoinder was:

"You will have to excuse me from entering upon that subject; I said I
never would discuss it until they voted by a two-thirds majority to
start the mills. Gentlemen, you have never seen New York. Let me take
you out and show you Fifth Avenue and the Park, and we shall come back
here to lunch at half-past one."

This we did, talking about everything except the one thing that they
wished to talk about. We had a good time, and I know they enjoyed
their lunch. There is one great difference between the American
working-man and the foreigner. The American is a man; he sits down at
lunch with people as if he were (as he generally is) a gentleman born.
It is splendid.

They returned to Pittsburgh, not another word having been said about
the works. But the men soon voted (there were very few votes against
starting) and I went again to Pittsburgh. I laid before the committee
the scale under which they were to work. It was a sliding scale based
on the price of the product. Such a scale really makes capital and
labor partners, sharing prosperous and disastrous times together. Of
course it has a minimum, so that the men are always sure of living
wages. As the men had seen these scales, it was unnecessary to go over
them. The chairman said:

"Mr. Carnegie, we will agree to everything. And now," he said
hesitatingly, "we have one favor to ask of you, and we hope you will
not refuse it."

"Well, gentlemen, if it be reasonable I shall surely grant it."

"Well, it is this: That you permit the officers of the union to sign
these papers for the men."

"Why, certainly, gentlemen! With the greatest pleasure! And then I
have a small favor to ask of you, which I hope you will not refuse, as
I have granted yours. Just to please me, after the officers have
signed, let every workman sign also for himself. You see, Mr.
Bennett, this scale lasts for three years, and some man, or body of
men, might dispute whether your president of the union had authority
to bind them for so long, but if we have his signature also, there
cannot be any misunderstanding."

There was a pause; then one man at his side whispered to Mr. Bennett
(but I heard him perfectly):

"By golly, the jig's up!"

So it was, but it was not by direct attack, but by a flank movement.
Had I not allowed the union officers to sign, they would have had a
grievance and an excuse for war. As it was, having allowed them to do
so, how could they refuse so simple a request as mine, that each free
and independent American citizen should also sign for himself. My
recollection is that as a matter of fact the officers of the union
never signed, but they may have done so. Why should they, if every
man's signature was required? Besides this, the workmen, knowing that
the union could do nothing for them when the scale was adopted,
neglected to pay dues and the union was deserted. We never heard of it
again. [That was in 1889, now twenty-seven years ago. The scale has
never been changed. The men would not change it if they could; it
works for their benefit, as I told them it would.]

Of all my services rendered to labor the introduction of the sliding
scale is chief. It is the solution of the capital and labor problem,
because it really makes them partners--alike in prosperity and
adversity. There was a yearly scale in operation in the Pittsburgh
district in the early years, but it is not a good plan because men and
employers at once begin preparing for a struggle which is almost
certain to come. It is far better for both employers and employed to
set no date for an agreed-upon scale to end. It should be subject to
six months' or a year's notice on either side, and in that way might
and probably would run on for years.

To show upon what trifles a contest between capital and labor may
turn, let me tell of two instances which were amicably settled by mere
incidents of seemingly little consequence. Once when I went out to
meet a men's committee, which had in our opinion made unfair demands,
I was informed that they were influenced by a man who secretly owned a
drinking saloon, although working in the mills. He was a great bully.
The sober, quiet workmen were afraid of him, and the drinking men were
his debtors. He was the real instigator of the movement.

We met in the usual friendly fashion. I was glad to see the men, many
of whom I had long known and could call by name. When we sat down at
the table the leader's seat was at one end and mine at the other. We
therefore faced each other. After I had laid our proposition before
the meeting, I saw the leader pick up his hat from the floor and
slowly put it on his head, intimating that he was about to depart.
Here was my chance.

"Sir, you are in the presence of gentlemen! Please be so good as to
take your hat off or leave the room!"

My eyes were kept full upon him. There was a silence that could be
felt. The great bully hesitated, but I knew whatever he did, he was
beaten. If he left it was because he had treated the meeting
discourteously by keeping his hat on, he was no gentleman; if he
remained and took off his hat, he had been crushed by the rebuke. I
didn't care which course he took. He had only two and either of them
was fatal. He had delivered himself into my hands. He very slowly took
off the hat and put it on the floor. Not a word did he speak
thereafter in that conference. I was told afterward that he had to
leave the place. The men rejoiced in the episode and a settlement was
harmoniously effected.

When the three years' scale was proposed to the men, a committee of
sixteen was chosen by them to confer with us. Little progress was made
at first, and I announced my engagements compelled me to return the
next day to New York. Inquiry was made as to whether we would meet a
committee of thirty-two, as the men wished others added to the
committee--a sure sign of division in their ranks. Of course we
agreed. The committee came from the works to meet me at the office in
Pittsburgh. The proceedings were opened by one of our best men, Billy
Edwards (I remember him well; he rose to high position afterwards),
who thought that the total offered was fair, but that the scale was
not equable. Some departments were all right, others were not fairly
dealt with. Most of the men were naturally of this opinion, but when
they came to indicate the underpaid, there was a difference, as was to
be expected. No two men in the different departments could agree.
Billy began:

"Mr. Carnegie, we agree that the total sum per ton to be paid is fair,
but we think it is not properly distributed among us. Now, Mr.
Carnegie, you take my job--"

"Order, order!" I cried. "None of that, Billy. Mr. Carnegie 'takes no
man's job.' Taking another's job is an unpardonable offense among
high-classed workmen."

There was loud laughter, followed by applause, and then more laughter.
I laughed with them. We had scored on Billy. Of course the dispute was
soon settled. It is not solely, often it is not chiefly, a matter of
dollars with workmen. Appreciation, kind treatment, a fair
deal--these are often the potent forces with the American workmen.

Employers can do so many desirable things for their men at little
cost. At one meeting when I asked what we could do for them, I
remember this same Billy Edwards rose and said that most of the men
had to run in debt to the storekeepers because they were paid monthly.
Well I remember his words:

"I have a good woman for wife who manages well. We go into Pittsburgh
every fourth Saturday afternoon and buy our supplies wholesale for the
next month and save one third. Not many of your men can do this.
Shopkeepers here charge so much. And another thing, they charge very
high for coal. If you paid your men every two weeks, instead of
monthly, it would be as good for the careful men as a raise in wages
of ten per cent or more."

"Mr. Edwards, that shall be done," I replied.

It involved increased labor and a few more clerks, but that was a
small matter. The remark about high prices charged set me to thinking
why the men could not open a coöperative store. This was also
arranged--the firm agreeing to pay the rent of the building, but
insisting that the men themselves take the stock and manage it. Out of
that came the Braddock's Coöperative Society, a valuable institution
for many reasons, not the least of them that it taught the men that
business had its difficulties.

The coal trouble was cured effectively by our agreeing that the
company sell all its men coal at the net cost price to us (about half
of what had been charged by coal dealers, so I was told) and arranging
to deliver it at the men's houses--the buyer paying only actual cost
of cartage.

There was another matter. We found that the men's savings caused them
anxiety, for little faith have the prudent, saving men in banks and,
unfortunately, our Government at that time did not follow the British
in having post-office deposit banks. We offered to take the actual
savings of each workman, up to two thousand dollars, and pay six per
cent interest upon them, to encourage thrift. Their money was kept
separate from the business, in a trust fund, and lent to such as
wished to build homes for themselves. I consider this one of the best
things that can be done for the saving workman.

It was such concessions as these that proved the most profitable
investments ever made by the company, even from an economical
standpoint. It pays to go beyond the letter of the bond with your men.
Two of my partners, as Mr. Phipps has put it, "knew my extreme
disposition to always grant the demands of labor, however
unreasonable," but looking back upon my failing in this respect, I
wish it had been greater--much greater. No expenditure returned such
dividends as the friendship of our workmen.

We soon had a body of workmen, I truly believe, wholly unequaled--the
best workmen and the best men ever drawn together. Quarrels and
strikes became things of the past. Had the Homestead men been our own
old men, instead of men we had to pick up, it is scarcely possible
that the trouble there in 1892 could have arisen. The scale at the
steel-rail mills, introduced in 1889, has been running up to the
present time (1914), and I think there never has been a labor
grievance at the works since. The men, as I have already stated,
dissolved their old union because there was no use paying dues to a
union when the men themselves had a three years' contract. Although
their labor union is dissolved another and a better one has taken its
place--a cordial union between the employers and their men, the best
union of all for both parties.

It is for the interest of the employer that his men shall make good
earnings and have steady work. The sliding scale enables the company
to meet the market; and sometimes to take orders and keep the works
running, which is the main thing for the working-men. High wages are
well enough, but they are not to be compared with steady employment.
The Edgar Thomson Mills are, in my opinion, the ideal works in respect
to the relations of capital and labor. I am told the men in our day,
and even to this day (1914) prefer two to three turns, but three turns
are sure to come. Labor's hours are to be shortened as we progress.
Eight hours will be the rule--eight for work, eight for sleep, and
eight for rest and recreation.

There have been many incidents in my business life proving that labor
troubles are not solely founded upon wages. I believe the best
preventive of quarrels to be recognition of, and sincere interest in,
the men, satisfying them that you really care for them and that you
rejoice in their success. This I can sincerely say--that I always
enjoyed my conferences with our workmen, which were not always in
regard to wages, and that the better I knew the men the more I liked
them. They have usually two virtues to the employer's one, and they
are certainly more generous to each other.

Labor is usually helpless against capital. The employer, perhaps,
decides to shut up the shops; he ceases to make profits for a short
time. There is no change in his habits, food, clothing, pleasures--no
agonizing fear of want. Contrast this with his workman whose lessening
means of subsistence torment him. He has few comforts, scarcely the
necessities for his wife and children in health, and for the sick
little ones no proper treatment. It is not capital we need to guard,
but helpless labor. If I returned to business to-morrow, fear of labor
troubles would not enter my mind, but tenderness for poor and
sometimes misguided though well-meaning laborers would fill my heart
and soften it; and thereby soften theirs.

Upon my return to Pittsburgh in 1892, after the Homestead trouble, I
went to the works and met many of the old men who had not been
concerned in the riot. They expressed the opinion that if I had been
at home the strike would never have happened. I told them that the
company had offered generous terms and beyond its offer I should not
have gone; that before their cable reached me in Scotland, the
Governor of the State had appeared on the scene with troops and wished
the law vindicated; that the question had then passed out of my
partners' hands. I added:

"You were badly advised. My partners' offer should have been accepted.
It was very generous. I don't know that I would have offered so much."

To this one of the rollers said to me:

"Oh, Mr. Carnegie, it wasn't a question of dollars. The boys would
have let you kick 'em, but they wouldn't let that other man stroke
their hair."

So much does sentiment count for in the practical affairs of life,
even with the laboring classes. This is not generally believed by
those who do not know them, but I am certain that disputes about wages
do not account for one half the disagreements between capital and
labor. There is lack of due appreciation and of kind treatment of
employees upon the part of the employers.

Suits had been entered against many of the strikers, but upon my
return these were promptly dismissed. All the old men who remained,
and had not been guilty of violence, were taken back. I had cabled
from Scotland urging that Mr. Schwab be sent back to Homestead. He had
been only recently promoted to the Edgar Thomson Works. He went back,
and "Charlie," as he was affectionately called, soon restored order,
peace, and harmony. Had he remained at the Homestead Works, in all
probability no serious trouble would have arisen. "Charlie" liked his
workmen and they liked him; but there still remained at Homestead an
unsatisfactory element in the men who had previously been discarded
from our various works for good reasons and had found employment at
the new works before we purchased them.




CHAPTER XIX

THE "GOSPEL OF WEALTH"


After my book, "The Gospel of Wealth,"[44] was published, it was
inevitable that I should live up to its teachings by ceasing to
struggle for more wealth. I resolved to stop accumulating and begin
the infinitely more serious and difficult task of wise distribution.
Our profits had reached forty millions of dollars per year and the
prospect of increased earnings before us was amazing. Our successors,
the United States Steel Corporation, soon after the purchase, netted
sixty millions in one year. Had our company continued in business and
adhered to our plans of extension, we figured that seventy millions in
that year might have been earned.

[Footnote 44: _The Gospel of Wealth_ (Century Company, New York, 1900)
contains various magazine articles written between 1886 and 1899 and
published in the _Youth's Companion_, the _Century Magazine_, the
_North American Review_, the _Forum_, the _Contemporary Review_, the
_Fortnightly Review_, the _Nineteenth Century_, and the _Scottish
Leader_. Gladstone asked that the article in the _North American
Review_ be printed in England. It was published in the _Pall Mall
Budget_ and christened the "Gospel of Wealth." Gladstone, Cardinal
Manning, Rev. Hugh Price, and Rev. Dr. Hermann Adler answered it, and
Mr. Carnegie replied to them.]

Steel had ascended the throne and was driving away all inferior
material. It was clearly seen that there was a great future ahead; but
so far as I was concerned I knew the task of distribution before me
would tax me in my old age to the utmost. As usual, Shakespeare had
placed his talismanic touch upon the thought and framed the sentence--

    "So distribution should undo excess,
    And each man have enough."

At this juncture--that is March, 1901--Mr. Schwab told me Mr. Morgan
had said to him he should really like to know if I wished to retire
from business; if so he thought he could arrange it. He also said he
had consulted our partners and that they were disposed to sell, being
attracted by the terms Mr. Morgan had offered. I told Mr. Schwab that
if my partners were desirous to sell I would concur, and we finally
sold.

[Illustration: CHARLES M. SCHWAB]

There had been so much deception by speculators buying old iron and
steel mills and foisting them upon innocent purchasers at inflated
values--hundred-dollar shares in some cases selling for a trifle--that
I declined to take anything for the common stock. Had I done so, it
would have given me just about one hundred millions more of five per
cent bonds, which Mr. Morgan said afterwards I could have obtained.
Such was the prosperity and such the money value of our steel
business. Events proved I should have been quite justified in asking
the additional sum named, for the common stock has paid five per cent
continuously since.[45] But I had enough, as has been proved, to keep
me busier than ever before, trying to distribute it.

[Footnote 45: The Carnegie Steel Company was bought by Mr. Morgan at
Mr. Carnegie's own price. There was some talk at the time of his
holding out for a higher price than he received, but testifying before
a committee of the House of Representatives in January, 1912, Mr.
Carnegie said: "I considered what was fair: and that is the option
Morgan got. Schwab went down and arranged it. I never saw Morgan on
the subject or any man connected with him. Never a word passed between
him and me. I gave my memorandum and Morgan saw it was eminently fair.
I have been told many times since by insiders that I should have asked
$100,000,000 more and could have got it easily. Once for all, I want
to put a stop to all this talk about Mr. Carnegie 'forcing high prices
for anything.'"]

My first distribution was to the men in the mills. The following
letters and papers will explain the gift:

     _New York, N.Y., March 12, 1901_

     I make this first use of surplus wealth, four millions of
     first mortgage 5% Bonds, upon retiring from business, as an
     acknowledgment of the deep debt which I owe to the
     workmen who have contributed so greatly to my success. It is
     designed to relieve those who may suffer from accidents, and
     provide small pensions for those needing help in old age.

     In addition I give one million dollars of such bonds, the
     proceeds thereof to be used to maintain the libraries and
     halls I have built for our workmen.

In return, the Homestead workmen presented the following address:

     _Munhall, Pa., Feb'y 23, 1903_

     MR. ANDREW CARNEGIE
     New York, N.Y.

     DEAR SIR:

     We, the employees of the Homestead Steel Works, desire by
     this means to express to you through our Committee our great
     appreciation of your benevolence in establishing the "Andrew
     Carnegie Relief Fund," the first annual report of its
     operation having been placed before us during the past
     month.

     The interest which you have always shown in your workmen has
     won for you an appreciation which cannot be expressed by
     mere words. Of the many channels through which you have
     sought to do good, we believe that the "Andrew Carnegie
     Relief Fund" stands first. We have personal knowledge of
     cares lightened and of hope and strength renewed in homes
     where human prospects seemed dark and discouraging.

     Respectfully yours

               { HARRY F. ROSE, _Roller_
               { JOHN BELL, JR., _Blacksmith_
     Committee { J.A. HORTON, _Timekeeper_
               { WALTER A. GREIG, _Electric Foreman_
               { HARRY CUSACK, _Yardmaster_

The Lucy Furnace men presented me with a beautiful silver plate and
inscribed upon it the following address:

     ANDREW CARNEGIE RELIEF FUND

     LUCY FURNACES

     _Whereas_, Mr. Andrew Carnegie, in his munificent
     philanthropy, has endowed the "Andrew Carnegie Relief Fund"
     for the benefit of employees of the Carnegie Company,
     Therefore be it

     _Resolved_, that the employees of the Lucy Furnaces, in
     special meeting assembled, do convey to Mr. Andrew Carnegie
     their sincere thanks for and appreciation of his unexcelled
     and bounteous endowment, and furthermore be it

     _Resolved_, that it is their earnest wish and prayer that
     his life may be long spared to enjoy the fruits of his
     works.

               { JAMES SCOTT, _Chairman_
               { LOUIS A. HUTCHISON, _Secretary_
               { JAMES DALY
     Committee { R.C. TAYLOR
               { JOHN V. WARD
               { FREDERICK VOELKER
               { JOHN M. VEIGH

I sailed soon for Europe, and as usual some of my partners did not
fail to accompany me to the steamer and bade me good-bye. But, oh! the
difference to me! Say what we would, do what we would, the solemn
change had come. This I could not fail to realize. The wrench was
indeed severe and there was pain in the good-bye which was also a
farewell.

Upon my return to New York some months later, I felt myself entirely
out of place, but was much cheered by seeing several of "the boys" on
the pier to welcome me--the same dear friends, but so different. I had
lost my partners, but not my friends. This was something; it was much.
Still a vacancy was left. I had now to take up my self-appointed task
of wisely disposing of surplus wealth. That would keep me deeply
interested.

One day my eyes happened to see a line in that most valuable paper,
the "Scottish American," in which I had found many gems. This was the
line:

"The gods send thread for a web begun."

It seemed almost as if it had been sent directly to me. This sank into
my heart, and I resolved to begin at once my first web. True enough,
the gods sent thread in the proper form. Dr. J.S. Billings, of the New
York Public Libraries, came as their agent, and of dollars, five and a
quarter millions went at one stroke for sixty-eight branch libraries,
promised for New York City. Twenty more libraries for Brooklyn
followed.

My father, as I have stated, had been one of the five pioneers in
Dunfermline who combined and gave access to their few books to their
less fortunate neighbors. I had followed in his footsteps by giving my
native town a library--its foundation stone laid by my mother--so that
this public library was really my first gift. It was followed by
giving a public library and hall to Allegheny City--our first home in
America. President Harrison kindly accompanied me from Washington and
opened these buildings. Soon after this, Pittsburgh asked for a
library, which was given. This developed, in due course, into a group
of buildings embracing a museum, a picture gallery, technical schools,
and the Margaret Morrison School for Young Women. This group of
buildings I opened to the public November 5, 1895. In Pittsburgh I had
made my fortune and in the twenty-four millions already spent on this
group,[46] she gets back only a small part of what she gave, and to
which she is richly entitled.

[Footnote 46: The total gifts to the Carnegie Institute at Pittsburgh
amounted to about twenty-eight million dollars.]

The second large gift was to found the Carnegie Institution of
Washington. The 28th of January, 1902, I gave ten million dollars in
five per cent bonds, to which there has been added sufficient to make
the total cash value twenty-five millions of dollars, the additions
being made upon record of results obtained. I naturally wished to
consult President Roosevelt upon the matter, and if possible to induce
the Secretary of State, Mr. John Hay, to serve as chairman, which he
readily agreed to do. With him were associated as directors my old
friend Abram S. Hewitt, Dr. Billings, William E. Dodge, Elihu Root,
Colonel Higginson, D.O. Mills, Dr. S. Weir Mitchell, and others.

When I showed President Roosevelt the list of the distinguished men
who had agreed to serve, he remarked: "You could not duplicate it." He
strongly favored the foundation, which was incorporated by an act of
Congress April 28, 1904, as follows:

     To encourage in the broadest and most liberal manner
     investigations, research and discovery, and the application
     of knowledge to the improvement of mankind; and, in
     particular, to conduct, endow and assist investigation in
     any department of science, literature or art, and to this
     end to coöperate with governments, universities, colleges,
     technical schools, learned societies, and individuals.

[Illustration: THE CARNEGIE INSTITUTE AT PITTSBURGH]

I was indebted to Dr. Billings as my guide, in selecting Dr. Daniel C.
Gilman as the first President. He passed away some years later. Dr.
Billings then recommended the present highly successful president, Dr.
Robert S. Woodward. Long may he continue to guide the affairs of the
Institution! The history of its achievements is so well known through
its publications that details here are unnecessary. I may, however,
refer to two of its undertakings that are somewhat unique. It is doing
a world-wide service with the wood-and-bronze yacht, "Carnegie," which
is voyaging around the world correcting the errors of the earlier
surveys. Many of these ocean surveys have been found misleading, owing
to variations of the compass. Bronze being non-magnetic, while iron
and steel are highly so, previous observations have proved liable to
error. A notable instance is that of the stranding of a Cunard
steamship near the Azores. Captain Peters, of the "Carnegie," thought
it advisable to test this case and found that the captain of the
ill-fated steamer was sailing on the course laid down upon the
admiralty map, and was not to blame. The original observation was
wrong. The error caused by variation was promptly corrected.

This is only one of numerous corrections reported to the nations who
go down to the sea in ships. Their thanks are our ample reward. In the
deed of gift I expressed the hope that our young Republic might some
day be able to repay, at least in some degree, the great debt it owes
to the older lands. Nothing gives me deeper satisfaction than the
knowledge that it has to some extent already begun to do so.

With the unique service rendered by the wandering "Carnegie," we may
rank that of the fixed observatory upon Mount Wilson, California, at
an altitude of 5886 feet. Professor Hale is in charge of it. He
attended the gathering of leading astronomers in Rome one year, and
such were his revelations there that these savants resolved their next
meeting should be on top of Mount Wilson. And so it was.

There is but one Mount Wilson. From a depth seventy-two feet down in
the earth photographs have been taken of new stars. On the first of
these plates many new worlds--I believe sixteen--were discovered. On
the second I think it was sixty new worlds which had come into our
ken, and on the third plate there were estimated to be more than a
hundred--several of them said to be twenty times the size of our sun.
Some of them were so distant as to require eight years for their light
to reach us, which inclines us to bow our heads whispering to
ourselves, "All we know is as nothing to the unknown." When the
monster new glass, three times larger than any existing, is in
operation, what revelations are to come! I am assured if a race
inhabits the moon they will be clearly seen.

The third delightful task was founding the Hero Fund, in which my
whole heart was concerned. I had heard of a serious accident in a coal
pit near Pittsburgh, and how the former superintendent, Mr. Taylor,
although then engaged in other pursuits, had instantly driven to the
scene, hoping to be of use in the crisis. Rallying volunteers, who
responded eagerly, he led them down the pit to rescue those below.
Alas, alas, he the heroic leader lost his own life.

I could not get the thought of this out of my mind. My dear, dear
friend, Mr. Richard Watson Gilder, had sent me the following true and
beautiful poem, and I re-read it the morning after the accident, and
resolved then to establish the Hero Fund.

    IN THE TIME OF PEACE

    'Twas said: "When roll of drum and battle's roar
    Shall cease upon the earth, O, then no more

    The deed--the race--of heroes in the land."
    But scarce that word was breathed when one small hand

    Lifted victorious o'er a giant wrong
    That had its victims crushed through ages long;

    Some woman set her pale and quivering face
    Firm as a rock against a man's disgrace;

    A little child suffered in silence lest
    His savage pain should wound a mother's breast;

    Some quiet scholar flung his gauntlet down
    And risked, in Truth's great name, the synod's frown;

    A civic hero, in the calm realm of laws,
    Did that which suddenly drew a world's applause;

    And one to the pest his lithe young body gave
    That he a thousand thousand lives might save.

Hence arose the five-million-dollar fund to reward heroes, or to
support the families of heroes, who perish in the effort to serve or
save their fellows, and to supplement what employers or others do in
contributing to the support of the families of those left destitute
through accidents. This fund, established April 15, 1904, has proved
from every point of view a decided success. I cherish a fatherly
regard for it since no one suggested it to me. As far as I know, it
never had been thought of; hence it is emphatically "my ain bairn."
Later I extended it to my native land, Great Britain, with
headquarters at Dunfermline--the Trustees of the Carnegie Dunfermline
Trust undertaking its administration, and splendidly have they
succeeded. In due time it was extended to France, Germany, Italy,
Belgium, Holland, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and Denmark.

Regarding its workings in Germany, I received a letter from David
Jayne Hill, our American Ambassador at Berlin, from which I quote:

     My main object in writing now is to tell you how pleased His
     Majesty is with the working of the German Hero Fund. He is
     enthusiastic about it and spoke in most complimentary terms
     of your discernment, as well as your generosity in founding
     it. He did not believe it would fill so important a place
     as it is doing. He told me of several cases that are really
     touching, and which would otherwise have been wholly
     unprovided for. One was that of a young man who saved a boy
     from drowning and just as they were about to lift him out of
     the water, after passing up the child into a boat, his heart
     failed, and he sank. He left a lovely young wife and a
     little boy. She has already been helped by the Hero Fund to
     establish a little business from which she can make a
     living, and the education of the boy, who is very bright,
     will be looked after. This is but one example.

     Valentini (Chief of the Civil Cabinet), who was somewhat
     skeptical at first regarding the need of such a fund, is now
     glowing with enthusiasm about it, and he tells me the whole
     Commission, which is composed of carefully chosen men, is
     earnestly devoted to the work of making the very best and
     wisest use of their means and has devoted much time to their
     decisions.

     They have corresponded with the English and French
     Commission, arranged to exchange reports, and made plans to
     keep in touch with one another in their work. They were
     deeply interested in the American report and have learned
     much from it.

King Edward of Britain was deeply impressed by the provisions of the
fund, and wrote me an autograph letter of appreciation of this and
other gifts to my native land, which I deeply value, and hence insert.

     _Windsor Castle, November 21, 1908_

     DEAR MR. CARNEGIE:

     I have for some time past been anxious to express to you my
     sense of your generosity for the great public objects which
     you have presented to this country, the land of your birth.

     Scarcely less admirable than the gifts themselves is the
     great care and thought you have taken in guarding against
     their misuse.

     I am anxious to tell you how warmly I recognize your most
     generous benefactions and the great services they are likely
     to confer upon the country.

     As a mark of recognition, I hope you will accept the
     portrait of myself which I am sending to you.

     Believe me, dear Mr. Carnegie,

     Sincerely yours

     EDWARD R. & I.

Some of the newspapers in America were doubtful of the merits of the
Hero Fund and the first annual report was criticized, but all this has
passed away and the action of the fund is now warmly extolled. It has
conquered, and long will it be before the trust is allowed to perish!
The heroes of the barbarian past wounded or killed their fellows; the
heroes of our civilized day serve or save theirs. Such the difference
between physical and moral courage, between barbarism and
civilization. Those who belong to the first class are soon to pass
away, for we are finally to regard men who slay each other as we now
do cannibals who eat each other; but those in the latter class will
not die as long as man exists upon the earth, for such heroism as they
display is god-like.

The Hero Fund will prove chiefly a pension fund. Already it has many
pensioners, heroes or the widows or children of heroes. A strange
misconception arose at first about it. Many thought that its purpose
was to stimulate heroic action, that heroes were to be induced to play
their parts for the sake of reward. This never entered my mind. It is
absurd. True heroes think not of reward. They are inspired and think
only of their fellows endangered; never of themselves. The fund is
intended to pension or provide in the most suitable manner for the
hero should he be disabled, or for those dependent upon him should he
perish in his attempt to save others. It has made a fine start and
will grow in popularity year after year as its aims and services are
better understood. To-day we have in America 1430 hero pensioners or
their families on our list.

I found the president for the Hero Fund in a Carnegie veteran, one of
the original boys, Charlie Taylor. No salary for Charlie--not a cent
would he ever take. He loves the work so much that I believe he would
pay highly for permission to live with it. He is the right man in the
right place. He has charge also, with Mr. Wilmot's able assistance, of
the pensions for Carnegie workmen (Carnegie Relief Fund[47]); also the
pensions for railway employees of my old division. Three relief funds
and all of them benefiting others.

[Footnote 47: This fund is now managed separately.]

I got my revenge one day upon Charlie, who was always urging me to do
for others. He is a graduate of Lehigh University and one of her most
loyal sons. Lehigh wished a building and Charlie was her chief
advocate. I said nothing, but wrote President Drinker offering the
funds for the building conditioned upon my naming it. He agreed, and I
called it "Taylor Hall." When Charlie discovered this, he came and
protested that it would make him ridiculous, that he had only been a
modest graduate, and was not entitled to have his name publicly
honored, and so on. I enjoyed his plight immensely, waiting until he
had finished, and then said that it would probably make him somewhat
ridiculous if I insisted upon "Taylor Hall," but he ought to be
willing to sacrifice himself somewhat for Lehigh. If he wasn't
consumed with vanity he would not care much how his name was used if
it helped his Alma Mater. Taylor was not much of a name anyhow. It was
his insufferable vanity that made such a fuss. He should conquer it.
He could make his decision. He could sacrifice the name of Taylor or
sacrifice Lehigh, just as he liked, but: "No Taylor, no Hall." I had
him! Visitors who may look upon that structure in after days and
wonder who Taylor was may rest assured that he was a loyal son of
Lehigh, a working, not merely a preaching, apostle of the gospel of
service to his fellow-men, and one of the best men that ever lived.
Such is our Lord High Commissioner of Pensions.




CHAPTER XX

EDUCATIONAL AND PENSION FUNDS


The fifteen-million-dollar pension fund for aged university professors
(The Carnegie Endowment for the Advancement of Learning), the fourth
important gift, given in June, 1905, required the selection of
twenty-five trustees from among the presidents of educational
institutions in the United States. When twenty-four of
these--President Harper, of Chicago University, being absent through
illness--honored me by meeting at our house for organization, I
obtained an important accession of those who were to become more
intimate friends. Mr. Frank A. Vanderlip proved of great service at
the start--his Washington experience being most valuable--and in our
president, Dr. Henry S. Pritchett, we found the indispensable man.

This fund is very near and dear to me--knowing, as I do, many who are
soon to become beneficiaries, and convinced as I am of their worth and
the value of the service already rendered by them. Of all professions,
that of teaching is probably the most unfairly, yes, most meanly paid,
though it should rank with the highest. Educated men, devoting their
lives to teaching the young, receive mere pittances. When I first took
my seat as a trustee of Cornell University, I was shocked to find how
small were the salaries of the professors, as a rule ranking below the
salaries of some of our clerks. To save for old age with these men is
impossible. Hence the universities without pension funds are compelled
to retain men who are no longer able, should no longer be required, to
perform their duties. Of the usefulness of the fund no doubt can be
entertained.[48] The first list of beneficiaries published was
conclusive upon this point, containing as it did several names of
world-wide reputation, so great had been their contributions to the
stock of human knowledge. Many of these beneficiaries and their widows
have written me most affecting letters. These I can never destroy, for
if I ever have a fit of melancholy, I know the cure lies in re-reading
these letters.

[Footnote 48: The total amount of this fund in 1919 was $29,250,000.]

My friend, Mr. Thomas Shaw (now Lord Shaw), of Dunfermline had written
an article for one of the English reviews showing that many poor
people in Scotland were unable to pay the fees required to give their
children a university education, although some had deprived themselves
of comforts in order to do so. After reading Mr. Shaw's article the
idea came to me to give ten millions in five per cent bonds, one half
of the £104,000 yearly revenue from it to be used to pay the fees of
the deserving poor students and the other half to improve the
universities.

The first meeting of the trustees of this fund (The Carnegie Trust for
the Universities of Scotland) was held in the Edinburgh office of the
Secretary of State for Scotland in 1902, Lord Balfour of Burleigh
presiding. It was a notable body of men--Prime Minister Balfour, Sir
Henry Campbell-Bannerman (afterwards Prime Minister), John Morley (now
Viscount Morley), James Bryce (now Viscount Bryce), the Earl of Elgin,
Lord Rosebery, Lord Reay, Mr. Shaw (now Lord Shaw), Dr. John Ross of
Dunfermline, "the man-of-all-work" that makes for the happiness or
instruction of his fellow-man, and others. I explained that I had
asked them to act because I could not entrust funds to the faculties
of the Scottish universities after reading the report of a recent
commission. Mr. Balfour promptly exclaimed: "Not a penny, not a
penny!" The Earl of Elgin, who had been a member of the commission,
fully concurred.

[Illustration: ANDREW CARNEGIE AND VISCOUNT BRYCE]

The details of the proposed fund being read, the Earl of Elgin was not
sure about accepting a trust which was not strict and specific. He
wished to know just what his duties were. I had given a majority of
the trustees the right to change the objects of beneficence and modes
of applying funds, should they in after days decide that the purposes
and modes prescribed for education in Scotland had become unsuitable
or unnecessary for the advanced times. Balfour of Burleigh agreed with
the Earl and so did Prime Minister Balfour, who said he had never
heard of a testator before who was willing to give such powers. He
questioned the propriety of doing so.

"Well," I said, "Mr. Balfour, I have never known of a body of men
capable of legislating for the generation ahead, and in some cases
those who attempt to legislate even for their own generation are not
thought to be eminently successful."

There was a ripple of laughter in which the Prime Minister himself
heartily joined, and he then said:

"You are right, quite right; but you are, I think, the first great
giver who has been wise enough to take this view."

I had proposed that a majority should have the power, but Lord Balfour
suggested not less than two thirds. This was accepted by the Earl of
Elgin and approved by all. I am very sure it is a wise provision, as
after days will prove. It is incorporated in all my large gifts, and I
rest assured that this feature will in future times prove valuable.
The Earl of Elgin, of Dunfermline, did not hesitate to become
Chairman of this trust. When I told Premier Balfour that I hoped Elgin
could be induced to assume this duty, he said promptly, "You could not
get a better man in Great Britain."

We are all entirely satisfied now upon that point. The query is: where
could we get his equal?

It is an odd coincidence that there are only four living men who have
been made Burgesses and received the Freedom of Dunfermline, and all
are connected with the trust for the Universities of Scotland, Sir
Henry Campbell-Bannerman, the Earl of Elgin, Dr. John Ross, and
myself. But there is a lady in the circle to-day, the only one ever so
greatly honored with the Freedom of Dunfermline, Mrs. Carnegie, whose
devotion to the town, like my own, is intense.

My election to the Lord Rectorship of St. Andrews in 1902 proved a
very important event in my life. It admitted me to the university
world, to which I had been a stranger. Few incidents in my life have
so deeply impressed me as the first meeting of the faculty, when I
took my seat in the old chair occupied successively by so many
distinguished Lord Rectors during the nearly five hundred years which
have elapsed since St. Andrews was founded. I read the collection of
rectorial speeches as a preparation for the one I was soon to make.
The most remarkable paragraph I met with in any of them was Dean
Stanley's advice to the students to "go to Burns for your theology."
That a high dignitary of the Church and a favorite of Queen Victoria
should venture to say this to the students of John Knox's University
is most suggestive as showing how even theology improves with the
years. The best rules of conduct are in Burns. First there is: "Thine
own reproach alone do fear." I took it as a motto early in life. And
secondly:

    "The fear o' hell's a hangman's whip
    To haud the wretch in order;
    But where ye feel your honor grip,
    Let that aye be your border."

John Stuart Mill's rectorial address to the St. Andrews students is
remarkable. He evidently wished to give them of his best. The
prominence he assigns to music as an aid to high living and pure
refined enjoyment is notable. Such is my own experience.

An invitation given to the principals of the four Scotch universities
and their wives or daughters to spend a week at Skibo resulted in much
joy to Mrs. Carnegie and myself. The first meeting was attended by the
Earl of Elgin, chairman of the Trust for the Universities of Scotland,
and Lord Balfour of Burleigh, Secretary for Scotland, and Lady
Balfour. After that "Principals' Week" each year became an established
custom. They as well as we became friends, and thereby, they all
agree, great good results to the universities. A spirit of coöperation
is stimulated. Taking my hand upon leaving after the first yearly
visit, Principal Lang said:

"It has taken the principals of the Scotch universities five hundred
years to learn how to begin our sessions. Spending a week together is
the solution."

One of the memorable results of the gathering at Skibo in 1906 was
that Miss Agnes Irwin, Dean of Radcliffe College, and
great-granddaughter of Benjamin Franklin, spent the principals' week
with us and all were charmed with her. Franklin received his first
doctor's degree from St. Andrews University, nearly one hundred and
fifty years ago. The second centenary of his birth was finely
celebrated in Philadelphia, and St. Andrews, with numerous other
universities throughout the world, sent addresses. St. Andrews also
sent a degree to the great-granddaughter. As Lord Rector, I was
deputed to confer it and place the mantle upon her. This was done the
first evening before a large audience, when more than two hundred
addresses were presented.

The audience was deeply impressed, as well it might be. St. Andrews
University, the first to confer the degree upon the great-grandfather,
conferred the same degree upon the great-grandchild one hundred and
forty-seven years later (and this upon her own merits as Dean of
Radcliffe College); sent it across the Atlantic to be bestowed by the
hands of its Lord Rector, the first who was not a British subject, but
who was born one as Franklin was, and who became an American citizen
as Franklin did; the ceremony performed in Philadelphia where Franklin
rests, in the presence of a brilliant assembly met to honor his
memory. It was all very beautiful, and I esteemed myself favored,
indeed, to be the medium of such a graceful and appropriate ceremony.
Principal Donaldson of St. Andrews was surely inspired when he thought
of it!

My unanimous reëlection by the students of St. Andrews, without a
contest for a second term, was deeply appreciated. And I liked the
Rector's nights, when the students claim him for themselves, no member
of the faculty being invited. We always had a good time. After the
first one, Principal Donaldson gave me the verdict of the Secretary as
rendered to him: "Rector So-and-So talked _to_ us, Rector Thus-and-So
talked _at_ us, both from the platform; Mr. Carnegie sat down in our
circle and talked _with_ us."

The question of aid to our own higher educational institutions often
intruded itself upon me, but my belief was that our chief
universities, such as Harvard and Columbia, with five to ten thousand
students,[49] were large enough; that further growth was undesirable;
that the smaller institutions (the colleges especially) were in
greater need of help and that it would be a better use of surplus
wealth to aid them. Accordingly, I afterwards confined myself to these
and am satisfied that this was wise. At a later date we found Mr.
Rockefeller's splendid educational fund, The General Education Board,
and ourselves were working in this fruitful field without
consultation, with sometimes undesirable results. Mr. Rockefeller
wished me to join his board and this I did. Coöperation was soon found
to be much to our mutual advantage, and we now work in unison.

[Footnote 49: Columbia University in 1920 numbered all told some
25,000 students in the various departments.]

In giving to colleges quite a number of my friends have been honored
as was my partner Charlie Taylor. Conway Hall at Dickinson College,
was named for Moncure D. Conway, whose Autobiography, recently
published, is pronounced "literature" by the "Athenæum." It says:
"These two volumes lie on the table glistening like gems 'midst the
piles of autobiographical rubbish by which they are surrounded." That
is rather suggestive for one who is adding to the pile.

The last chapter in Mr. Conway's Autobiography ends with the following
paragraph:

     Implore Peace, O my reader, from whom I now part. Implore
     peace not of deified thunder clouds but of every man, woman,
     child thou shalt meet. Do not merely offer the prayer, "Give
     peace in our time," but do thy part to answer it! Then, at
     least, though the world be at strife, there shall be peace
     in thee.

My friend has put his finger upon our deepest disgrace. It surely must
soon be abolished between civilized nations.

The Stanton Chair of Economics at Kenyon College, Ohio, was founded in
memory of Edwin M. Stanton, who kindly greeted me as a boy in
Pittsburgh when I delivered telegrams to him, and was ever cordial to
me in Washington, when I was an assistant to Secretary Scott. The
Hanna Chair in Western Reserve University, Cleveland; the John Hay
Library at Brown University; the second Elihu Root Fund for Hamilton,
the Mrs. Cleveland Library for Wellesley, gave me pleasure to christen
after these friends. I hope more are to follow, commemorating those I
have known, liked, and honored. I also wished a General Dodge Library
and a Gayley Library to be erected from my gifts, but these friends
had already obtained such honor from their respective Alma Maters.

My first gift to Hamilton College was to be named the Elihu Root
Foundation, but that ablest of all our Secretaries of State, and in
the opinion of President Roosevelt, "the wisest man he ever knew,"
took care, it seems, not to mention the fact to the college
authorities. When I reproached him with this dereliction, he
laughingly replied:

"Well, I promise not to cheat you the next gift you give us."

And by a second gift this lapse was repaired after all, but I took
care not to entrust the matter directly to him. The Root Fund of
Hamilton[50] is now established beyond his power to destroy. Root is a
great man, and, as the greatest only are he is, in his simplicity,
sublime. President Roosevelt declared he would crawl on his hands and
knees from the White House to the Capitol if this would insure Root's
nomination to the presidency with a prospect of success. He was
considered vulnerable because he had been counsel for corporations
and was too little of the spouter and the demagogue, too much of the
modest, retiring statesman to split the ears of the groundlings.[51]
The party foolishly decided not to risk Root.

[Footnote 50: It amounts to $250,000.]

[Footnote 51: At the Meeting in Memory of the Life and Work of Andrew
Carnegie held on April 25, 1920, in the Engineering Societies Building
in New York, Mr. Root made an address in the course of which, speaking
of Mr. Carnegie, he said:

"He belonged to that great race of nation-builders who have made the
development of America the wonder of the world.... He was the
kindliest man I ever knew. Wealth had brought to him no hardening of
the heart, nor made him forget the dreams of his youth. Kindly,
affectionate, charitable in his judgments, unrestrained in his
sympathies, noble in his impulses, I wish that all the people who
think of him as a rich man giving away money he did not need could
know of the hundreds of kindly things he did unknown to the world."]

My connection with Hampton and Tuskegee Institutes, which promote the
elevation of the colored race we formerly kept in slavery, has been a
source of satisfaction and pleasure, and to know Booker Washington is
a rare privilege. We should all take our hats off to the man who not
only raised himself from slavery, but helped raise millions of his
race to a higher stage of civilization. Mr. Washington called upon me
a few days after my gift of six hundred thousand dollars was made to
Tuskegee and asked if he might be allowed to make one suggestion. I
said: "Certainly."

"You have kindly specified that a sum from that fund be set aside for
the future support of myself and wife during our lives, and we are
very grateful, but, Mr. Carnegie, the sum is far beyond our needs and
will seem to my race a fortune. Some might feel that I was no longer a
poor man giving my services without thought of saving money. Would you
have any objection to changing that clause, striking out the sum, and
substituting 'only suitable provision'? I'll trust the trustees. Mrs.
Washington and myself need very little."

I did so, and the deed now stands, but when Mr. Baldwin asked for the
original letter to exchange it for the substitute, he told me that the
noble soul objected. That document addressed to him was to be
preserved forever, and handed down; but he would put it aside and let
the substitute go on file.

This is an indication of the character of the leader of his race. No
truer, more self-sacrificing hero ever lived: a man compounded of all
the virtues. It makes one better just to know such pure and noble
souls--human nature in its highest types is already divine here on
earth. If it be asked which man of our age, or even of the past ages,
has risen from the lowest to the highest, the answer must be Booker
Washington. He rose from slavery to the leadership of his people--a
modern Moses and Joshua combined, leading his people both onward and
upward.

In connection with these institutions I came in contact with their
officers and trustees--men like Principal Hollis B. Frissell of
Hampton, Robert C. Ogden, George Foster Peabody, V. Everit Macy,
George McAneny and William H. Baldwin--recently lost to us, alas!--men
who labor for others. It was a blessing to know them intimately. The
Cooper Union, the Mechanics and Tradesmen's Society, indeed every
institution[52] in which I became interested, revealed many men and
women devoting their time and thought, not to "miserable aims that end
with self," but to high ideals which mean the relief and uplift of
their less fortunate brethren.

[Footnote 52: The universities, colleges, and educational institutions
to which Mr. Carnegie gave either endowment funds or buildings number
five hundred. All told his gifts to them amounted to $27,000,000.]

My giving of organs to churches came very early in my career, I having
presented to less than a hundred members of the Swedenborgian Church
in Allegheny which my father favored, an organ, after declining to
contribute to the building of a new church for so few. Applications
from other churches soon began to pour in, from the grand Catholic
Cathedral of Pittsburgh down to the small church in the country
village, and I was kept busy. Every church seemed to need a better
organ than it had, and as the full price for the new instrument was
paid, what the old one brought was clear profit. Some ordered organs
for very small churches which would almost split the rafters, as was
the case with the first organ given the Swedenborgians; others had
bought organs before applying but our check to cover the amount was
welcome. Finally, however, a rigid system of giving was developed. A
printed schedule requiring answers to many questions has now to be
filled and returned before action is taken. The department is now
perfectly systematized and works admirably because we graduate the
gift according to the size of the church.

Charges were made in the rigid Scottish Highlands that I was
demoralizing Christian worship by giving organs to churches. The very
strict Presbyterians there still denounce as wicked an attempt "to
worship God with a kist fu' o' whistles," instead of using the human
God-given voice. After that I decided that I should require a partner
in my sin, and therefore asked each congregation to pay one half of
the desired new organ. Upon this basis the organ department still
operates and continues to do a thriving business, the demand for
improved organs still being great. Besides, many new churches are
required for increasing populations and for these organs are
essential.

I see no end to it. In requiring the congregation to pay one half the
cost of better instruments, there is assurance of needed and
reasonable expenditure. Believing from my own experience that it is
salutary for the congregation to hear sacred music at intervals in the
service and then slowly to disperse to the strains of the
reverence-compelling organ after such sermons as often show us little
of a Heavenly Father, I feel the money spent for organs is well spent.
So we continue the organ department.[53]

[Footnote 53: The "organ department" up to 1919 had given 7689 organs
to as many different churches at a cost of over six million dollars.]

Of all my work of a philanthropic character, my private pension fund
gives me the highest and noblest return. No satisfaction equals that
of feeling you have been permitted to place in comfortable
circumstances, in their old age, people whom you have long known to be
kind and good and in every way deserving, but who from no fault of
their own, have not sufficient means to live respectably, free from
solicitude as to their mere maintenance. Modest sums insure this
freedom. It surprised me to find how numerous were those who needed
some aid to make the difference between an old age of happiness and
one of misery. Some such cases had arisen before my retirement from
business, and I had sweet satisfaction from this source. Not one
person have I ever placed upon the pension list[54] that did not fully
deserve assistance. It is a real roll of honor and mutual affection.
All are worthy. There is no publicity about it. No one knows who is
embraced. Not a word is ever breathed to others.

[Footnote 54: This amounted to over $250,000 a year.]

This is my favorite and best answer to the question which will never
down in my thoughts: "What good am I doing in the world to deserve
all my mercies?" Well, the dear friends of the pension list give me a
satisfactory reply, and this always comes to me in need. I have had
far beyond my just share of life's blessings; therefore I never ask
the Unknown for anything. We are in the presence of universal law and
should bow our heads in silence and obey the Judge within, asking
nothing, fearing nothing, just doing our duty right along, seeking no
reward here or hereafter.

It is, indeed, more blessed to give than to receive. These dear good
friends would do for me and mine as I do for them were positions
reversed. I am sure of this. Many precious acknowledgments have I
received. Some venture to tell me they remember me every night in
their prayers and ask for me every blessing. Often I cannot refrain
from giving expression to my real feelings in return.

"Pray, don't," I say. "Don't ask anything more for me. I've got far
beyond my just share already. Any fair committee sitting upon my case
would take away more than half the blessings already bestowed." These
are not mere words, I feel their truth.

The Railroad Pension Fund is of a similar nature. Many of the old boys
of the Pittsburgh Division (or their widows) are taken care of by it.
It began years ago and grew to its present proportions. It now
benefits the worthy railroad men who served under me when I was
superintendent on the Pennsylvania, or their widows, who need help. I
was only a boy when I first went among these trainmen and got to know
them by name. They were very kind to me. Most of the men beneficiaries
of the fund I have known personally. They are dear friends.

Although the four-million-dollar fund I gave for workmen in the mills
(Steel Workers' Pensions) embraces hundreds that I never saw, there
are still a sufficient number upon it that I do remember to give that
fund also a strong hold upon me.




CHAPTER XXI

THE PEACE PALACE AND PITTENCRIEFF


Peace, at least as between English-speaking peoples,[55] must have
been early in my thoughts. In 1869, when Britain launched the monster
Monarch, then the largest warship known, there was, for some
now-forgotten reason, talk of how she could easily compel tribute from
our American cities one after the other. Nothing could resist her. I
cabled John Bright, then in the British Cabinet (the cable had
recently been opened):

"First and best service possible for Monarch, bringing home body
Peabody."[56]

[Footnote 55: "Let men say what they will, I say that as surely as the
sun in the heavens once shone upon Britain and America united, so
surely it is one morning to rise, shine upon, and greet again the
Reunited States--the British-American Union." (Quoted in Alderson's
_Andrew Carnegie, The Man and His Work_, p. 108. New York, 1909.)]

[Footnote 56: George Peabody, the American merchant and
philanthropist, who died in London in 1869.]

No signature was given. Strange to say, this was done, and thus the
Monarch became the messenger of peace, not of destruction. Many years
afterwards I met Mr. Bright at a small dinner party in Birmingham and
told him I was his young anonymous correspondent. He was surprised
that no signature was attached and said his heart was in the act. I am
sure it was. He is entitled to all credit.

He was the friend of the Republic when she needed friends during the
Civil War. He had always been my favorite living hero in public life
as he had been my father's. Denounced as a wild radical at first, he
kept steadily on until the nation came to his point of view. Always
for peace he would have avoided the Crimean War, in which Britain
backed the wrong horse, as Lord Salisbury afterwards acknowledged. It
was a great privilege that the Bright family accorded me, as a friend,
to place a replica of the Manchester Bright statue in Parliament, in
the stead of a poor one removed.

I became interested in the Peace Society of Great Britain upon one of
my early visits and attended many of its meetings, and in later days I
was especially drawn to the Parliamentary Union established by Mr.
Cremer, the famous working-man's representative in Parliament. Few men
living can be compared to Mr. Cremer. When he received the Nobel Prize
of £8000 as the one who had done the most that year for peace, he
promptly gave all but £1000, needed for pressing wants, to the
Arbitration Committee. It was a noble sacrifice. What is money but
dross to the true hero! Mr. Cremer is paid a few dollars a week by his
trade to enable him to exist in London as their member of Parliament,
and here was fortune thrown in his lap only to be devoted by him to
the cause of peace. This is the heroic in its finest form.

I had the great pleasure of presenting the Committee to President
Cleveland at Washington in 1887, who received the members cordially
and assured them of his hearty coöperation. From that day the
abolition of war grew in importance with me until it finally
overshadowed all other issues. The surprising action of the first
Hague Conference gave me intense joy. Called primarily to consider
disarmament (which proved a dream), it created the commanding reality
of a permanent tribunal to settle international disputes. I saw in
this the greatest step toward peace that humanity had ever taken, and
taken as if by inspiration, without much previous discussion. No
wonder the sublime idea captivated the conference.

If Mr. Holls, whose death I so deeply deplored, were alive to-day and
a delegate to the forthcoming second Conference with his chief, Andrew
D. White, I feel that these two might possibly bring about the
creation of the needed International Court for the abolition of war.
He it was who started from The Hague at night for Germany, upon
request of his chief, and saw the German Minister of Foreign Affairs,
and the Emperor and finally prevailed upon them to approve of the High
Court, and not to withdraw their delegates as threatened--a service
for which Mr. Holls deserves to be enrolled among the greatest
servants of mankind. Alas, death came to him while still in his prime.

The day that International Court is established will become one of the
most memorable days in the world's history.[57] It will ring the knell
of man killing man--the deepest and blackest of crimes. It should be
celebrated in every land as I believe it will be some day, and that
time, perchance, not so remote as expected. In that era not a few of
those hitherto extolled as heroes will have found oblivion because
they failed to promote peace and good-will instead of war.

[Footnote 57: "I submit that the only measure required to-day for the
maintenance of world peace is an agreement between three or four of
the leading Civilized Powers (and as many more as desire to join--the
more the better) pledged to coöperate against disturbers of world
peace, should such arise." (Andrew Carnegie, in address at unveiling
of a bust of William Randall Cremer at the Peace Palace of The Hague,
August 29, 1913.)]

When Andrew D. White and Mr. Holls, upon their return from The Hague,
suggested that I offer the funds needed for a Temple of Peace at The
Hague, I informed them that I never could be so presumptuous; that if
the Government of the Netherlands informed me of its desire to have
such a temple and hoped I would furnish the means, the request would
be favorably considered. They demurred, saying this could hardly be
expected from any Government. Then I said I could never act in the
matter.

Finally the Dutch Government did make application, through its
Minister, Baron Gevers in Washington, and I rejoiced. Still, in
writing him, I was careful to say that the drafts of his Government
would be duly honored. I did not send the money. The Government drew
upon me for it, and the draft for a million and a half is kept as a
memento. It seems to me almost too much that any individual should be
permitted to perform so noble a duty as that of providing means for
this Temple of Peace--the most holy building in the world because it
has the holiest end in view. I do not even except St. Peter's, or any
building erected to the glory of God, whom, as Luther says, "we cannot
serve or aid; He needs no help from us." This temple is to bring
peace, which is so greatly needed among His erring creatures. "The
highest worship of God is service to man." At least, I feel so with
Luther and Franklin.

When in 1907 friends came and asked me to accept the presidency of the
Peace Society of New York, which they had determined to organize, I
declined, alleging that I was kept very busy with many affairs, which
was true; but my conscience troubled me afterwards for declining. If I
were not willing to sacrifice myself for the cause of peace what
should I sacrifice for? What was I good for? Fortunately, in a few
days, the Reverend Lyman Abbott, the Reverend Mr. Lynch, and some
other notable laborers for good causes called to urge my
reconsideration. I divined their errand and frankly told them they
need not speak. My conscience had been tormenting me for declining and
I would accept the presidency and do my duty. After that came the
great national gathering (the following April) when for the first time
in the history of Peace Society meetings, there attended delegates
from thirty-five of the states of the Union, besides many foreigners
of distinction.[58]

[Footnote 58: Mr. Carnegie does not mention the fact that in December,
1910, he gave to a board of trustees $10,000,000, the revenue of which
was to be administered for "the abolition of international war, the
foulest blot upon our civilization." This is known as the Carnegie
Endowment for International Peace. The Honorable Elihu Root is
president of the board of trustees.]

My first decoration then came unexpectedly. The French Government had
made me Knight Commander of the Legion of Honor, and at the Peace
Banquet in New York, over which I presided, Baron d'Estournelles de
Constant appeared upon the stage and in a compelling speech invested
me with the regalia amid the cheers of the company. It was a great
honor, indeed, and appreciated by me because given for my services to
the cause of International Peace. Such honors humble, they do not
exalt; so let them come.[59] They serve also to remind me that I must
strive harder than ever, and watch every act and word more closely,
that I may reach just a little nearer the standard the givers--deluded
souls--mistakenly assume in their speeches, that I have already
attained.

[Footnote 59: Mr. Carnegie received also the Grand Cross Order of
Orange-Nassau from Holland, the Grand Cross Order of Danebrog from
Denmark, a gold medal from twenty-one American Republics and had
doctors' degrees from innumerable universities and colleges. He was
also a member of many institutes, learned societies and clubs--over
190 in number.]

       *       *       *       *       *

No gift I have made or can ever make can possibly approach that of
Pittencrieff Glen, Dunfermline. It is saturated with childish
sentiment--all of the purest and sweetest. I must tell that story:

Among my earliest recollections are the struggles of Dunfermline to
obtain the rights of the town to part of the Abbey grounds and the
Palace ruins. My Grandfather Morrison began the campaign, or, at
least, was one of those who did. The struggle was continued by my
Uncles Lauder and Morrison, the latter honored by being charged with
having incited and led a band of men to tear down a certain wall. The
citizens won a victory in the highest court and the then Laird ordered
that thereafter "no Morrison be admitted to the Glen." I, being a
Morrison like my brother-cousin, Dod, was debarred. The Lairds of
Pittencrieff for generations had been at variance with the
inhabitants.

The Glen is unique, as far as I know. It adjoins the Abbey and Palace
grounds, and on the west and north it lies along two of the main
streets of the town. Its area (between sixty and seventy acres) is
finely sheltered, its high hills grandly wooded. It always meant
paradise to the child of Dunfermline. It certainly did to me. When I
heard of paradise, I translated the word into Pittencrieff Glen,
believing it to be as near to paradise as anything I could think of.
Happy were we if through an open lodge gate, or over the wall or under
the iron grill over the burn, now and then we caught a glimpse inside.

Almost every Sunday Uncle Lauder took "Dod" and "Naig" for a walk
around the Abbey to a part that overlooked the Glen--the busy crows
fluttering around in the big trees below. Its Laird was to us children
the embodiment of rank and wealth. The Queen, we knew, lived in
Windsor Castle, but she didn't own Pittencrieff, not she! Hunt of
Pittencrieff wouldn't exchange with her or with any one. Of this we
were sure, because certainly neither of us would. In all my
childhood's--yes and in my early manhood's--air-castle building (which
was not small), nothing comparable in grandeur approached
Pittencrieff. My Uncle Lauder predicted many things for me when I
became a man, but had he foretold that some day I should be rich
enough, and so supremely fortunate as to become Laird of Pittencrieff,
he might have turned my head. And then to be able to hand it over to
Dunfermline as a public park--my paradise of childhood! Not for a
crown would I barter that privilege.

When Dr. Ross whispered to me that Colonel Hunt might be induced to
sell, my ears cocked themselves instantly. He wished an extortionate
price, the doctor thought, and I heard nothing further for some time.
When indisposed in London in the autumn of 1902, my mind ran upon the
subject, and I intended to wire Dr. Ross to come up and see me. One
morning, Mrs. Carnegie came into my room and asked me to guess who had
arrived and I guessed Dr. Ross. Sure enough, there he was. We talked
over Pittencrieff. I suggested that if our mutual friend and
fellow-townsman, Mr. Shaw in Edinburgh (Lord Shaw of Dunfermline) ever
met Colonel Hunt's agents he could intimate that their client might
some day regret not closing with me as another purchaser equally
anxious to buy might not be met with, and I might change my mind or
pass away. Mr. Shaw told the doctor when he mentioned this that he had
an appointment to meet with Hunt's lawyer on other business the next
morning and would certainly say so.

I sailed shortly after for New York and received there one day a cable
from Mr. Shaw stating that the Laird would accept forty-five thousand
pounds. Should he close? I wired: "Yes, provided it is under Ross's
conditions"; and on Christmas Eve, I received Shaw's reply: "Hail,
Laird of Pittencrieff!" So I was the happy possessor of the grandest
title on earth in my estimation. The King--well, he was only the King.
He didn't own King Malcolm's tower nor St. Margaret's shrine, nor
Pittencrieff Glen. Not he, poor man. I did, and I shall be glad to
condescendingly show the King those treasures should he ever visit
Dunfermline.

As the possessor of the Park and the Glen I had a chance to find out
what, if anything, money could do for the good of the masses of a
community, if placed in the hands of a body of public-spirited
citizens. Dr. Ross was taken into my confidence so far as Pittencrieff
Park was concerned, and with his advice certain men intended for a
body of trustees were agreed upon and invited to Skibo to organize.
They imagined it was in regard to transferring the Park to the town;
not even to Dr. Ross was any other subject mentioned. When they heard
that half a million sterling in bonds, bearing five per cent interest,
was also to go to them for the benefit of Dunfermline, they were
surprised.[60]

[Footnote 60: Additional gifts, made later, brought this gift up to
$3,750,000.]

It is twelve years since the Glen was handed over to the trustees and
certainly no public park was ever dearer to a people. The children's
yearly gala day, the flower shows and the daily use of the Park by the
people are surprising. The Glen now attracts people from neighboring
towns. In numerous ways the trustees have succeeded finely in the
direction indicated in the trust deed, namely:

     To bring into the monotonous lives of the toiling masses of
     Dunfermline, more "of sweetness and light," to give to
     them--especially the young--some charm, some happiness, some
     elevating conditions of life which residence elsewhere would
     have denied, that the child of my native town, looking back
     in after years, however far from home it may have roamed,
     will feel that simply by virtue of being such, life has been
     made happier and better. If this be the fruit of your
     labors, you will have succeeded; if not, you will have
     failed.

To this paragraph I owe the friendship of Earl Grey, formerly
Governor-General of Canada. He wrote Dr. Ross:

"I must know the man who wrote that document in the 'Times' this
morning."

We met in London and became instantly sympathetic. He is a great soul
who passes instantly into the heart and stays there. Lord Grey is also
to-day a member (trustee) of the ten-million-dollar fund for the
United Kingdom.[61]

[Footnote 61: Mr. Carnegie refers to the gift of ten million dollars
to the Carnegie United Kingdom Trust merely in connection with Earl
Grey. His references to his gifts are casual, in that he refers only
to the ones in which he happens for the moment to be interested. Those
he mentions are merely a part of the whole. He gave to the Church
Peace Union over $2,000,000, to the United Engineering Society
$1,500,000, to the International Bureau of American Republics
$850,000, and to a score or more of research, hospital, and
educational boards sums ranging from $100,000 to $500,000. He gave to
various towns and cities over twenty-eight hundred library buildings
at a cost of over $60,000,000. The largest of his gifts he does not
mention at all. This was made in 1911 to the Carnegie Corporation of
New York and was $125,000,000. The Corporation is the residuary
legatee under Mr. Carnegie's will and it is not yet known what further
sum may come to it through that instrument. The object of the
Corporation, as defined by Mr. Carnegie himself in a letter to the
trustees, is:

"To promote the advancement and diffusion of knowledge and
understanding among the people of the United States by aiding
technical schools, institutions of higher learning, libraries,
scientific research, hero funds, useful publications and by such other
agencies and means as shall from time to time be found appropriate
therefor."

The Carnegie benefactions, all told, amount to something over
$350,000,000--surely a huge sum to have been brought together and then
distributed by one man.]

Thus, Pittencrieff Glen is the most soul-satisfying public gift I ever
made, or ever can make. It is poetic justice that the grandson of
Thomas Morrison, radical leader in his day, nephew of Bailie Morrison,
his son and successor, and above all son of my sainted father and my
most heroic mother, should arise and dispossess the lairds, should
become the agent for conveying the Glen and Park to the people of
Dunfermline forever. It is a true romance, which no air-castle can
quite equal or fiction conceive. The hand of destiny seems to hover
over it, and I hear something whispering: "Not altogether in vain have
you lived--not altogether in vain." This is the crowning mercy of my
career! I set it apart from all my other public gifts. Truly the
whirligig of time brings in some strange revenges.

It is now thirteen years since I ceased to accumulate wealth and began
to distribute it. I could never have succeeded in either had I stopped
with having enough to retire upon, but nothing to retire to. But there
was the habit and the love of reading, writing and speaking upon
occasion, and also the acquaintance and friendship of educated men
which I had made before I gave up business. For some years after
retiring I could not force myself to visit the works. This, alas,
would recall so many who had gone before. Scarcely one of my early
friends would remain to give me the hand-clasp of the days of old.
Only one or two of these old men would call me "Andy."

Do not let it be thought, however, that my younger partners were
forgotten, or that they have not played a very important part in
sustaining me in the effort of reconciling myself to the new
conditions. Far otherwise! The most soothing influence of all was
their prompt organization of the Carnegie Veteran Association, to
expire only when the last member dies. Our yearly dinner together, in
our own home in New York, is a source of the greatest pleasure,--so
great that it lasts from one year to the other. Some of the Veterans
travel far to be present, and what occurs between us constitutes one
of the dearest joys of my life. I carry with me the affection of "my
boys." I am certain I do. There is no possible mistake about that
because my heart goes out to them. This I number among my many
blessings and in many a brooding hour this fact comes to me, and I say
to myself: "Rather this, minus fortune, than multi-millionairedom
without it--yes, a thousand times, yes."

Many friends, great and good men and women, Mrs. Carnegie and I are
favored to know, but not one whit shall these ever change our joint
love for the "boys." For to my infinite delight her heart goes out to
them as does mine. She it was who christened our new New York home
with the first Veteran dinner. "The partners first" was her word. It
was no mere idle form when they elected Mrs. Carnegie the first
honorary member, and our daughter the second. Their place in our
hearts is secure. Although I was the senior, still we were "boys
together." Perfect trust and common aims, not for self only, but for
each other, and deep affection, moulded us into a brotherhood. We were
friends first and partners afterwards. Forty-three out of forty-five
partners are thus bound together for life.

Another yearly event that brings forth many choice spirits is our
Literary Dinner, at home, our dear friend Mr. Richard Watson Gilder,
editor of the "Century," being the manager.[62] His devices and
quotations from the writings of the guest of the year, placed upon
the cards of the guests, are so appropriate, as to cause much
hilarity. Then the speeches of the novitiates give zest to the
occasion. John Morley was the guest of honor when with us in 1895 and
a quotation from his works was upon the card at each plate.

[Footnote 62: "Yesterday we had a busy day in Toronto. The grand event
was a dinner at six o'clock where we all spoke, A.C. making a
remarkable address.... I can't tell you how I am enjoying this. Not
only seeing new places, but the talks with our own party. It is,
indeed, a liberal education. A.C. is truly a 'great' man; that is, a
man of enormous faculty and a great imagination. I don't remember any
friend who has such a range of poetical quotation, unless it is
Stedman. (Not so much _range_ as numerous quotations from Shakespeare,
Burns, Byron, etc.) His views are truly large and prophetic. And,
unless I am mistaken, he has a genuine ethical character. He is not
perfect, but he is most interesting and remarkable; a true democrat;
his benevolent actions having a root in principle and character. He is
not accidentally the intimate friend of such high natures as Arnold
and Morley." (_Letters of Richard Watson Gilder_, edited by his
daughter Rosamond Gilder, p. 374. New York, 1916.)]

One year Gilder appeared early in the evening of the dinner as he
wished to seat the guests. This had been done, but he came to me
saying it was well he had looked them over. He had found John
Burroughs and Ernest Thompson Seton were side by side, and as they
were then engaged in a heated controversy upon the habits of beasts
and birds, in which both had gone too far in their criticisms, they
were at dagger's points. Gilder said it would never do to seat them
together. He had separated them. I said nothing, but slipped into the
dining-room unobserved and replaced the cards as before. Gilder's
surprise was great when he saw the men next each other, but the result
was just as I had expected. A reconciliation took place and they
parted good friends. Moral: If you wish to play peace-maker, seat
adversaries next each other where they must begin by being civil.

Burroughs and Seton both enjoyed the trap I set for them. True it is,
we only hate those whom we do not know. It certainly is often the way
to peace to invite your adversary to dinner and even beseech him to
come, taking no refusal. Most quarrels become acute from the parties
not seeing and communicating with each other and hearing too much of
their disagreement from others. They do not fully understand the
other's point of view and all that can be said for it. Wise is he who
offers the hand of reconciliation should a difference with a friend
arise. Unhappy he to the end of his days who refuses it. No possible
gain atones for the loss of one who has been a friend even if that
friend has become somewhat less dear to you than before. He is still
one with whom you have been intimate, and as age comes on friends pass
rapidly away and leave you.

He is the happy man who feels there is not a human being to whom he
does not wish happiness, long life, and deserved success, not one in
whose path he would cast an obstacle nor to whom he would not do a
service if in his power. All this he can feel without being called
upon to retain as a friend one who has proved unworthy beyond question
by dishonorable conduct. For such there should be nothing felt but
pity, infinite pity. And pity for your own loss also, for true
friendship can only feed and grow upon the virtues.

    "When love begins to sicken and decay
    It useth an enforced ceremony."

The former geniality may be gone forever, but each can wish the other
nothing but happiness.

None of my friends hailed my retirement from business more warmly than
Mark Twain. I received from him the following note, at a time when the
newspapers were talking much about my wealth.

     DEAR SIR AND FRIEND:

     You seem to be prosperous these days. Could you lend an
     admirer a dollar and a half to buy a hymn-book with? God
     will bless you if you do; I feel it, I know it. So will I.
     If there should be other applications this one not to count.

     Yours

     MARK

     P.S. Don't send the hymn-book, send the money. I want to
     make the selection myself.

     M.

When he was lying ill in New York I went to see him frequently, and we
had great times together, for even lying in bed he was as bright as
ever. One call was to say good-bye, before my sailing for Scotland.
The Pension Fund for University Professors was announced in New York
soon after I sailed. A letter about it from Mark, addressed to "Saint
Andrew," reached me in Scotland, from which I quote the following:

     You can take my halo. If you had told me what you had done
     when at my bedside you would have got it there and then. It
     is pure tin and paid "the duty" when it came down.

Those intimate with Mr. Clemens (Mark Twain) will certify that he was
one of the charmers. Joe Jefferson is the only man who can be conceded
his twin brother in manner and speech, their charm being of the same
kind. "Uncle Remus" (Joel Chandler Harris) is another who has charm,
and so has George W. Cable; yes, and Josh Billings also had it. Such
people brighten the lives of their friends, regardless of themselves.
They make sunshine wherever they go. In Rip Van Winkle's words: "All
pretty much alike, dem fellers." Every one of them is unselfish and
warm of heart.

The public only knows one side of Mr. Clemens--the amusing part.
Little does it suspect that he was a man of strong convictions upon
political and social questions and a moralist of no mean order. For
instance, upon the capture of Aguinaldo by deception, his pen was the
most trenchant of all. Junius was weak in comparison.

The gathering to celebrate his seventieth birthday was unique. The
literary element was there in force, but Mark had not forgotten to ask
to have placed near him the multi-millionaire, Mr. H.H. Rogers, one
who had been his friend in need. Just like Mark. Without exception,
the leading literary men dwelt in their speeches exclusively upon the
guest's literary work. When my turn came, I referred to this and asked
them to note that what our friend had done as a man would live as long
as what he had written. Sir Walter Scott and he were linked
indissolubly together. Our friend, like Scott, was ruined by the
mistakes of partners, who had become hopelessly bankrupt. Two courses
lay before him. One the smooth, easy, and short way--the legal path.
Surrender all your property, go through bankruptcy, and start afresh.
This was all he owed to creditors. The other path, long, thorny, and
dreary, a life struggle, with everything sacrificed. There lay the two
paths and this was his decision:

"Not what I owe to my creditors, but what I owe to myself is the
issue."

There are times in most men's lives that test whether they be dross or
pure gold. It is the decision made in the crisis which proves the man.
Our friend entered the fiery furnace a man and emerged a hero. He paid
his debts to the utmost farthing by lecturing around the world. "An
amusing cuss, Mark Twain," is all very well as a popular verdict, but
what of Mr. Clemens the man and the hero, for he is both and in the
front rank, too, with Sir Walter.

He had a heroine in his wife. She it was who sustained him and
traveled the world round with him as his guardian angel, and enabled
him to conquer as Sir Walter did. This he never failed to tell to his
intimates. Never in my life did three words leave so keen a pang as
those uttered upon my first call after Mrs. Clemens passed away. I
fortunately found him alone and while my hand was still in his, and
before one word had been spoken by either, there came from him, with a
stronger pressure of my hand, these words: "A ruined home, a ruined
home." The silence was unbroken. I write this years after, but still I
hear the words again and my heart responds.

One mercy, denied to our forefathers, comes to us of to-day. If the
Judge within give us a verdict of acquittal as having lived this life
well, we have no other Judge to fear.

          "To thine own self be true,
    And it must follow, as the night the day,
    Thou canst not then be false to any man."

Eternal punishment, because of a few years' shortcomings here on
earth, would be the reverse of Godlike. Satan himself would recoil
from it.




CHAPTER XXII

MATHEW ARNOLD AND OTHERS


The most charming man, John Morley and I agree, that we ever knew was
Matthew Arnold. He had, indeed, "a charm"--that is the only word which
expresses the effect of his presence and his conversation. Even his
look and grave silences charmed.

[Illustration: _Photograph from Underwood & Underwood, N.Y._

MATTHEW ARNOLD]

He coached with us in 1880, I think, through Southern England--William
Black and Edwin A. Abbey being of the party. Approaching a pretty
village he asked me if the coach might stop there a few minutes. He
explained that this was the resting-place of his godfather, Bishop
Keble, and he should like to visit his grave. He continued:

"Ah, dear, dear Keble! I caused him much sorrow by my views upon
theological subjects, which caused me sorrow also, but notwithstanding
he was deeply grieved, dear friend as he was, he traveled to Oxford
and voted for me for Professor of English Poetry."

We walked to the quiet churchyard together. Matthew Arnold in silent
thought at the grave of Keble made upon me a lasting impression. Later
the subject of his theological views was referred to. He said they had
caused sorrow to his best friends.

"Mr. Gladstone once gave expression to his deep disappointment, or to
something like displeasure, saying I ought to have been a bishop. No
doubt my writings prevented my promotion, as well as grieved my
friends, but I could not help it. I had to express my views."

I remember well the sadness of tone with which these last words
were spoken, and how very slowly. They came as from the deep. He had
his message to deliver. Steadily has the age advanced to receive it.
His teachings pass almost uncensured to-day. If ever there was a
seriously religious man it was Matthew Arnold. No irreverent word ever
escaped his lips. In this he and Gladstone were equally above
reproach, and yet he had in one short sentence slain the supernatural.
"The case against miracles is closed. They do not happen."

He and his daughter, now Mrs. Whitridge, were our guests when in New
York in 1883, and also at our mountain home in the Alleghanies, so
that I saw a great deal, but not enough, of him. My mother and myself
drove him to the hall upon his first public appearance in New York.
Never was there a finer audience gathered. The lecture was not a
success, owing solely to his inability to speak well in public. He was
not heard. When we returned home his first words were:

"Well, what have you all to say? Tell me! Will I do as a lecturer?"

I was so keenly interested in his success that I did not hesitate to
tell him it would never do for him to go on unless he fitted himself
for public speaking. He must get an elocutionist to give him lessons
upon two or three points. I urged this so strongly that he consented
to do so. After we all had our say, he turned to my mother, saying:

"Now, dear Mrs. Carnegie, they have all given me their opinions, but I
wish to know what you have to say about my first night as a lecturer
in America."

"Too ministerial, Mr. Arnold, too ministerial," was the reply slowly
and softly delivered. And to the last Mr. Arnold would occasionally
refer to that, saying he felt it hit the nail on the head. When he
returned to New York from his Western tour, he had so much improved
that his voice completely filled the Brooklyn Academy of Music. He had
taken a few lessons from a professor of elocution in Boston, as
advised, and all went well thereafter.

He expressed a desire to hear the noted preacher, Mr. Beecher; and we
started for Brooklyn one Sunday morning. Mr. Beecher had been apprized
of our coming so that after the services he might remain to meet Mr.
Arnold. When I presented Mr. Arnold he was greeted warmly. Mr. Beecher
expressed his delight at meeting one in the flesh whom he had long
known so well in the spirit, and, grasping his hand, he said:

"There is nothing you have written, Mr. Arnold, which I have not
carefully read at least once and a great deal many times, and always
with profit, always with profit!"

"Ah, then, I fear, Mr. Beecher," replied Arnold, "you may have found
some references to yourself which would better have been omitted."

"Oh, no, no, those did me the most good of all," said the smiling
Beecher, and they both laughed.

Mr. Beecher was never at a loss. After presenting Matthew Arnold to
him, I had the pleasure of presenting the daughter of Colonel
Ingersoll, saying, as I did so:

"Mr. Beecher, this is the first time Miss Ingersoll has ever been in a
Christian church."

He held out both hands and grasped hers, and looking straight at her
and speaking slowly, said:

"Well, well, you are the most beautiful heathen I ever saw." Those who
remember Miss Ingersoll in her youth will not differ greatly with Mr.
Beecher. Then: "How's your father, Miss Ingersoll? I hope he's well.
Many a time he and I have stood together on the platform, and wasn't
it lucky for me we were on the same side!"

Beecher was, indeed, a great, broad, generous man, who absorbed what
was good wherever found. Spencer's philosophy, Arnold's insight
tempered with sound sense, Ingersoll's staunch support of high
political ends were powers for good in the Republic. Mr. Beecher was
great enough to appreciate and hail as helpful friends all of these
men.

Arnold visited us in Scotland in 1887, and talking one day of sport he
said he did not shoot, he could not kill anything that had wings and
could soar in the clear blue sky; but, he added, he could not give up
fishing--"the accessories are so delightful." He told of his happiness
when a certain duke gave him a day's fishing twice or three times a
year. I forget who the kind duke was, but there was something unsavory
about him and mention was made of this. He was asked how he came to be
upon intimate terms with such a man.

"Ah!" he said, "a duke is always a personage with us, always a
personage, independent of brains or conduct. We are all snobs.
Hundreds of years have made us so, all snobs. We can't help it. It is
in the blood."

This was smilingly said, and I take it he made some mental
reservations. He was no snob himself, but one who naturally "smiled at
the claims of long descent," for generally the "descent" cannot be
questioned.

He was interested, however, in men of rank and wealth, and I remember
when in New York he wished particularly to meet Mr. Vanderbilt. I
ventured to say he would not find him different from other men.

"No, but it is something to know the richest man in the world," he
replied. "Certainly the man who makes his own wealth eclipses those
who inherit rank from others."

I asked him one day why he had never written critically upon
Shakespeare and assigned him his place upon the throne among the
poets. He said that thoughts of doing so had arisen, but reflection
always satisfied him that he was incompetent to write upon, much less
to criticize, Shakespeare. He believed it could not be successfully
done. Shakespeare was above all, could be measured by no rules of
criticism; and much as he should have liked to dwell upon his
transcendent genius, he had always recoiled from touching the subject.
I said that I was prepared for this, after his tribute which stands
to-day unequaled, and I recalled his own lines from his sonnet:

    SHAKESPEARE

    Others abide our question. Thou art free.
    We ask and ask--Thou smilest and art still,
    Out-topping knowledge. For the loftiest hill
    Who to the stars uncrowns his majesty,

    Planting his steadfast footsteps in the sea,
    Making the heaven of heavens his dwelling-place,
    Spares but the cloudy border of his base
    To the foil'd searching of mortality;

    And thou, who didst the stars and sunbeams know,
    Self-school'd, self-scann'd, self-honour'd, self-secure,
    Didst stand on earth unguess'd at--Better so!

    All pains the immortal spirit must endure,
    All weakness which impairs, all griefs which bow,
    Find their sole voice in that victorious brow.

I knew Mr. Shaw (Josh Billings) and wished Mr. Arnold, the apostle of
sweetness and light, to meet that rough diamond--rough, but still a
diamond. Fortunately one morning Josh came to see me in the Windsor
Hotel, where we were then living, and referred to our guest,
expressing his admiration for him. I replied:

"You are going to dine with him to-night. The ladies are going out and
Arnold and myself are to dine alone; you complete the trinity."

To this he demurred, being a modest man, but I was inexorable. No
excuse would be taken; he must come to oblige me. He did. I sat
between them at dinner and enjoyed this meeting of extremes. Mr.
Arnold became deeply interested in Mr. Shaw's way of putting things
and liked his Western anecdotes, laughing more heartily than I had
ever seen him do before. One incident after another was told from the
experience of the lecturer, for Mr. Shaw had lectured for fifteen
years in every place of ten thousand inhabitants or more in the United
States.

Mr. Arnold was desirous of hearing how the lecturer held his
audiences.

"Well," he said, "you mustn't keep them laughing too long, or they
will think you are laughing at them. After giving the audience
amusement you must become earnest and play the serious rôle. For
instance, 'There are two things in this life for which no man is ever
prepared. Who will tell me what these are?' Finally some one cries out
'Death.' 'Well, who gives me the other?' Many respond--wealth,
happiness, strength, marriage, taxes. At last Josh begins, solemnly:
'None of you has given the second. There are two things on earth for
which no man is ever prepared, and them's twins,' and the house
shakes." Mr. Arnold did also.

"Do you keep on inventing new stories?" was asked.

"Yes, always. You can't lecture year after year unless you find new
stories, and sometimes these fail to crack. I had one nut which I felt
sure would crack and bring down the house, but try as I would it never
did itself justice, all because I could not find the indispensable
word, just one word. I was sitting before a roaring wood fire one
night up in Michigan when the word came to me which I knew would crack
like a whip. I tried it on the boys and it did. It lasted longer than
any one word I used. I began: 'This is a highly critical age. People
won't believe until they fully understand. Now there's Jonah and the
whale. They want to know all about it, and it's my opinion that
neither Jonah nor the whale fully understood it. And then they ask
what Jonah was doing in the whale's--the whale's society.'"

Mr. Shaw was walking down Broadway one day when accosted by a real
Westerner, who said:

"I think you are Josh Billings."

"Well, sometimes I am called that."

"I have five thousand dollars for you right here in my pocket-book."

"Here's Delmonico's, come in and tell me all about it."

After seating themselves, the stranger said he was part owner in a
gold mine in California, and explained that there had been a dispute
about its ownership and that the conference of partners broke up in
quarreling. The stranger said he had left, threatening he would take
the bull by the horns and begin legal proceedings. "The next morning I
went to the meeting and told them I had turned over Josh Billings's
almanac that morning and the lesson for the day was: 'When you take
the bull by the horns, take him by the tail; you can get a better hold
and let go when you're a mind to.' We laughed and laughed and felt
that was good sense. We took your advice, settled, and parted good
friends. Some one moved that five thousand dollars be given Josh, and
as I was coming East they appointed me treasurer and I promised to
hand it over. There it is."

The evening ended by Mr. Arnold saying:

"Well, Mr. Shaw, if ever you come to lecture in England, I shall be
glad to welcome and introduce you to your first audience. Any foolish
man called a lord could do you more good than I by introducing you,
but I should so much like to do it."

Imagine Matthew Arnold, the apostle of sweetness and light,
introducing Josh Billings, the foremost of jesters, to a select London
audience.

In after years he never failed to ask after "our leonine friend, Mr.
Shaw."

Meeting Josh at the Windsor one morning after the notable dinner I sat
down with him in the rotunda and he pulled out a small memorandum
book, saying as he did so:

"Where's Arnold? I wonder what he would say to this. The 'Century'
gives me $100 a week, I agreeing to send them any trifle that occurs
to me. I try to give it something. Here's this from Uncle Zekiel, my
weekly budget: 'Of course the critic is a greater man than the author.
Any fellow who can point out the mistakes another fellow has made is a
darned sight smarter fellow than the fellow who made them.'"

I told Mr. Arnold a Chicago story, or rather a story about Chicago. A
society lady of Boston visiting her schoolmate friend in Chicago, who
was about to be married, was overwhelmed with attention. Asked by a
noted citizen one evening what had charmed her most in Chicago, she
graciously replied:

"What surprises me most isn't the bustle of business, or your
remarkable development materially, or your grand residences; it is the
degree of culture and refinement I find here." The response promptly
came:

"Oh, we are just dizzy on cult out here, you bet."

Mr. Arnold was not prepared to enjoy Chicago, which had impressed him
as the headquarters of Philistinism. He was, however, surprised and
gratified at meeting with so much "culture and refinement." Before he
started he was curious to know what he should find most interesting. I
laughingly said that he would probably first be taken to see the most
wonderful sight there, which was said to be the slaughter houses, with
new machines so perfected that the hog driven in at one end came out
hams at the other before its squeal was out of one's ears. Then after
a pause he asked reflectively:

"But why should one go to slaughter houses, why should one hear hogs
squeal?" I could give no reason, so the matter rested.

Mr. Arnold's Old Testament favorite was certainly Isaiah: at least his
frequent quotations from that great poet, as he called him, led one to
this conclusion. I found in my tour around the world that the sacred
books of other religions had been stripped of the dross that had
necessarily accumulated around their legends. I remembered Mr. Arnold
saying that the Scriptures should be so dealt with. The gems from
Confucius and others which delight the world have been selected with
much care and appear as "collects." The disciple has not the
objectionable accretions of the ignorant past presented to him.

The more one thinks over the matter, the stronger one's opinion
becomes that the Christian will have to follow the Eastern example and
winnow the wheat from the chaff--worse than chaff, sometimes the
positively pernicious and even poisonous refuse. Burns, in the
"Cotter's Saturday Night," pictures the good man taking down the big
Bible for the evening service:

    "He wales a portion with judicious care."

We should have those portions selected and use the selections only. In
this, and much besides, the man whom I am so thankful for having known
and am so favored as to call friend, has proved the true teacher in
advance of his age, the greatest poetic teacher in the domain of "the
future and its viewless things."

I took Arnold down from our summer home at Cresson in the Alleghanies
to see black, smoky Pittsburgh. In the path from the Edgar Thomson
Steel Works to the railway station there are two flights of steps to
the bridge across the railway, the second rather steep. When we had
ascended about three quarters of it he suddenly stopped to gain
breath. Leaning upon the rail and putting his hand upon his heart, he
said to me:

"Ah, this will some day do for me, as it did for my father."

I did not know then of the weakness of his heart, but I never forgot
this incident, and when not long after the sad news came of his sudden
death, after exertion in England endeavoring to evade an obstacle, it
came back to me with a great pang that our friend had foretold his
fate. Our loss was great. To no man I have known could Burns's epitaph
upon Tam Samson be more appropriately applied:

    "Tam Samson's weel-worn clay here lies:
    Ye canting zealots, spare him!
    If honest worth in heaven rise,
    Ye'll mend or ye win near him."

The name of a dear man comes to me just here, Dr. Oliver Wendell
Holmes, of Boston, everybody's doctor, whose only ailment toward the
end was being eighty years of age. He was a boy to the last. When
Matthew Arnold died a few friends could not resist taking steps toward
a suitable memorial to his memory. These friends quietly provided the
necessary sum, as no public appeal could be thought of. No one could
be permitted to contribute to such a fund except such as had a right
to the privilege, for privilege it was felt to be. Double, triple the
sum could readily have been obtained. I had the great satisfaction of
being permitted to join the select few and to give the matter a little
attention upon our side of the Atlantic. Of course I never thought of
mentioning the matter to dear Dr. Holmes--not that he was not one of
the elect, but that no author or professional man should be asked to
contribute money to funds which, with rare exceptions, are best
employed when used for themselves. One morning, however, I received a
note from the doctor, saying that it had been whispered to him that
there was such a movement on foot, and that I had been mentioned in
connection with it, and if he were judged worthy to have his name upon
the roll of honor, he would be gratified. Since he had heard of it he
could not rest without writing to me, and he should like to hear in
reply. That he was thought worthy goes without saying.

This is the kind of memorial any man might wish. I venture to say that
there was not one who contributed to it who was not grateful to the
kind fates for giving him the opportunity.




CHAPTER XXIII

BRITISH POLITICAL LEADERS


In London, Lord Rosebery, then in Gladstone's Cabinet and a rising
statesman, was good enough to invite me to dine with him to meet Mr.
Gladstone, and I am indebted to him for meeting the world's first
citizen. This was, I think, in 1885, for my "Triumphant Democracy"[63]
appeared in 1886, and I remember giving Mr. Gladstone, upon that
occasion, some startling figures which I had prepared for it.

[Footnote 63: _Triumphant Democracy, or Fifty Years' March of the
Republic._ London and New York, 1886.]

I never did what I thought right in a social matter with greater
self-denial, than when later the first invitation came from Mr.
Gladstone to dine with him. I was engaged to dine elsewhere and sorely
tempted to plead that an invitation from the real ruler of Great
Britain should be considered as much of a command as that of the
ornamental dignitary. But I kept my engagement and missed the man I
most wished to meet. The privilege came later, fortunately, when
subsequent visits to him at Hawarden were made.

Lord Rosebery opened the first library I ever gave, that of
Dunfermline, and he has recently (1905) opened the latest given by
me--one away over in Stornoway. When he last visited New York I drove
him along the Riverside Drive, and he declared that no city in the
world possessed such an attraction. He was a man of brilliant parts,
but his resolutions were

    "Sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought."

Had he been born to labor and entered the House of Commons in youth,
instead of being dropped without effort into the gilded upper chamber,
he might have acquired in the rough-and-tumble of life the tougher
skin, for he was highly sensitive and lacked tenacity of purpose
essential to command in political life. He was a charming speaker--a
eulogist with the lightest touch and the most graceful style upon
certain themes of any speaker of his day. [Since these lines were
written he has become, perhaps, the foremost eulogist of our race. He
has achieved a high place. All honor to him!]

One morning I called by appointment upon him. After greetings he took
up an envelope which I saw as I entered had been carefully laid on his
desk, and handed it to me, saying:

"I wish you to dismiss your secretary."

"That is a big order, Your Lordship. He is indispensable, and a
Scotsman," I replied. "What is the matter with him?"

"This isn't your handwriting; it is his. What do you think of a man
who spells Rosebery with two _r's_?"

I said if I were sensitive on that point life would not be endurable
for me. "I receive many letters daily when at home and I am sure that
twenty to thirty per cent of them mis-spell my name, ranging from
'Karnaghie' to 'Carnagay.'"

But he was in earnest. Just such little matters gave him great
annoyance. Men of action should learn to laugh at and enjoy these
small things, or they themselves may become "small." A charming
personality withal, but shy, sensitive, capricious, and reserved,
qualities which a few years in the Commons would probably have
modified.

When he was, as a Liberal, surprising the House of Lords and creating
some stir, I ventured to let off a little of my own democracy upon
him.

"Stand for Parliament boldly. Throw off your hereditary rank,
declaring you scorn to accept a privilege which is not the right of
every citizen. Thus make yourself the real leader of the people, which
you never can be while a peer. You are young, brilliant, captivating,
with the gift of charming speech. No question of your being Prime
Minister if you take the plunge."

To my surprise, although apparently interested, he said very quietly:

"But the House of Commons couldn't admit me as a peer."

"That's what I should hope. If I were in your place, and rejected, I
would stand again for the next vacancy and force the issue. Insist
that one having renounced his hereditary privileges becomes elevated
to citizenship and is eligible for any position to which he is
elected. Victory is certain. That's playing the part of a Cromwell.
Democracy worships a precedent-breaker or a precedent-maker."

We dropped the subject. Telling Morley of this afterward, I shall
never forget his comment:

"My friend, Cromwell doesn't reside at Number 38 Berkeley Square."
Slowly, solemnly spoken, but conclusive.

Fine fellow, Rosebery, only he was handicapped by being born a peer.
On the other hand, Morley, rising from the ranks, his father a surgeon
hard-pressed to keep his son at college, is still "Honest John,"
unaffected in the slightest degree by the so-called elevation to the
peerage and the Legion of Honor, both given for merit. The same with
"Bob" Reid, M.P., who became Earl Loreburn and Lord High Chancellor,
Lord Haldane, his successor as Chancellor; Asquith, Prime Minister,
Lloyd George, and others. Not even the rulers of our Republic to-day
are more democratic or more thorough men of the people.

When the world's foremost citizen passed away, the question was, Who
is to succeed Gladstone; who can succeed him? The younger members of
the Cabinet agreed to leave the decision to Morley. Harcourt or
Campbell-Bannerman? There was only one impediment in the path of the
former, but that was fatal--inability to control his temper. The issue
had unfortunately aroused him to such outbursts as really unfitted him
for leadership, and so the man of calm, sober, unclouded judgment was
considered indispensable.

I was warmly attached to Harcourt, who in turn was a devoted admirer
of our Republic, as became the husband of Motley's daughter. Our
census and our printed reports, which I took care that he should
receive, interested him deeply. Of course, the elevation
of the representative of my native town of Dunfermline
(Campbell-Bannerman)[64] gave me unalloyed pleasure, the more so since
in returning thanks from the Town House to the people assembled he
used these words:

"I owe my election to my Chairman, Bailie Morrison."

[Footnote 64: Campbell-Bannerman was chosen leader of the Liberal
Party in December, 1898.]

The Bailie, Dunfermline's leading radical, was my uncle. We were
radical families in those days and are so still, both Carnegies and
Morrisons, and intense admirers of the Great Republic, like that one
who extolled Washington and his colleagues as "men who knew and dared
proclaim the royalty of man"--a proclamation worth while. There is
nothing more certain than that the English-speaking race in orderly,
lawful development will soon establish the golden rule of citizenship
through evolution, never revolution:

    "The rank is but the guinea's stamp,
    The man's the gowd for a' that."

This feeling already prevails in all the British colonies. The dear
old Motherland hen has ducks for chickens which give her much anxiety
breasting the waves, while she, alarmed, screams wildly from the
shore; but she will learn to swim also by and by.

In the autumn of 1905 Mrs. Carnegie and I attended the ceremony of
giving the Freedom of Dunfermline to our friend, Dr. John Ross,
chairman of the Carnegie Dunfermline Trust, foremost and most zealous
worker for the good of the town. Provost Macbeth in his speech
informed the audience that the honor was seldom conferred, that there
were only three living burgesses--one their member of Parliament, H.
Campbell-Bannerman, then Prime Minister; the Earl of Elgin of
Dunfermline, ex-Viceroy of India, then Colonial Secretary; and the
third myself. This seemed great company for me, so entirely out of the
running was I as regards official station.

The Earl of Elgin is the descendant of The Bruce. Their family vault
is in Dunfermline Abbey, where his great ancestor lies under the Abbey
bell. It has been noted how Secretary Stanton selected General Grant
as the one man in the party who could not possibly be the commander.
One would be very apt to make a similar mistake about the Earl. When
the Scottish Universities were to be reformed the Earl was second on
the committee. When the Conservative Government formed its Committee
upon the Boer War, the Earl, a Liberal, was appointed chairman. When
the decision of the House of Lords brought dire confusion upon the
United Free Church of Scotland, Lord Elgin was called upon as the
Chairman of Committee to settle the matter. Parliament embodied his
report in a bill, and again he was placed at the head to apply it.
When trustees for the Universities of Scotland Fund were to be
selected, I told Prime Minister Balfour I thought the Earl of Elgin as
a Dunfermline magnate could be induced to take the chairmanship. He
said I could not get a better man in Great Britain. So it has proved.
John Morley said to me one day afterwards, but before he had, as a
member of the Dunfermline Trust, experience of the chairman:

"I used to think Elgin about the most problematical public man in high
position I had ever met, but I now know him one of the ablest. Deeds,
not words; judgment, not talk."

Such the descendant of The Bruce to-day, the embodiment of modest
worth and wisdom combined.

Once started upon a Freedom-getting career, there seemed no end to
these honors.[65] With headquarters in London in 1906, I received six
Freedoms in six consecutive days, and two the week following, going
out by morning train and returning in the evening. It might be thought
that the ceremony would become monotonous, but this was not so, the
conditions being different in each case. I met remarkable men in the
mayors and provosts and the leading citizens connected with municipal
affairs, and each community had its own individual stamp and its
problems, successes, and failures. There was generally one greatly
desired improvement overshadowing all other questions engrossing the
attention of the people. Each was a little world in itself. The City
Council is a Cabinet in miniature and the Mayor the Prime Minister.
Domestic politics keep the people agog. Foreign relations are not
wanting. There are inter-city questions with neighboring communities,
joint water or gas or electrical undertakings of mighty import,
conferences deciding for or against alliances or separations.

[Footnote 65: Mr. Carnegie had received no less than fifty-four
Freedoms of cities in Great Britain and Ireland. This was a
record--Mr. Gladstone coming second with seventeen.]

In no department is the contrast greater between the old world and the
new than in municipal government. In the former the families reside
for generations in the place of birth with increasing devotion to the
town and all its surroundings. A father achieving the mayorship
stimulates the son to aspire to it. That invaluable asset, city pride,
is created, culminating in romantic attachment to native places.
Councilorships are sought that each in his day and generation may be
of some service to the town. To the best citizens this is a creditable
object of ambition. Few, indeed, look beyond it--membership in
Parliament being practically reserved for men of fortune, involving as
it does residence in London without compensation. This latter,
however, is soon to be changed and Britain follow the universal
practice of paying legislators for service rendered. [In 1908; since
realized; four hundred pounds is now paid.]

After this she will probably follow the rest of the world by having
Parliament meet in the daytime, its members fresh and ready for the
day's work, instead of giving all day to professional work and then
with exhausted brains undertaking the work of governing the country
after dinner. Cavendish, the authority on whist, being asked if a man
could possibly finesse a knave, second round, third player, replied,
after reflecting, "Yes, he might _after dinner_."

The best people are on the councils of British towns, incorruptible,
public-spirited men, proud of and devoted to their homes. In the
United States progress is being made in this direction, but we are
here still far behind Britain. Nevertheless, people tend to settle
permanently in places as the country becomes thickly populated. We
shall develop the local patriot who is anxious to leave the place of
his birth a little better than he found it. It is only one generation
since the provostship of Scotch towns was generally reserved for one
of the local landlords belonging to the upper classes. That "the
Briton dearly loves a lord" is still true, but the love is rapidly
disappearing.

In Eastbourne, Kings-Lynn, Salisbury, Ilkeston, and many other ancient
towns, I found the mayor had risen from the ranks, and had generally
worked with his hands. The majority of the council were also of this
type. All gave their time gratuitously. It was a source of much
pleasure to me to know the provosts and leaders in council of so many
towns in Scotland and England, not forgetting Ireland where my Freedom
tour was equally attractive. Nothing could excel the reception
accorded me in Cork, Waterford, and Limerick. It was surprising to see
the welcome on flags expressed in the same Gaelic words, _Cead mille
failthe_ (meaning "a hundred thousand welcomes") as used by the
tenants of Skibo.

Nothing could have given me such insight into local public life and
patriotism in Britain as Freedom-taking, which otherwise might have
become irksome. I felt myself so much at home among the city chiefs
that the embarrassment of flags and crowds and people at the windows
along our route was easily met as part of the duty of the day, and
even the address of the chief magistrate usually furnished new phases
of life upon which I could dwell. The lady mayoresses were delightful
in all their pride and glory.

My conclusion is that the United Kingdom is better served by the
leading citizens of her municipalities, elected by popular vote, than
any other country far and away can possibly be; and that all is sound
to the core in that important branch of government. Parliament itself
could readily be constituted of a delegation of members from the town
councils without impairing its efficiency. Perhaps when the sufficient
payment of members is established, many of these will be found at
Westminster and that to the advantage of the Kingdom.




CHAPTER XXIV

GLADSTONE AND MORLEY


Mr. Gladstone paid my "American Four-in-Hand in Britain" quite a
compliment when Mrs. Carnegie and I were his guests at Hawarden in
April, 1892. He suggested one day that I should spend the morning with
him in his new library, while he arranged his books (which no one
except himself was ever allowed to touch), and we could converse. In
prowling about the shelves I found a unique volume and called out to
my host, then on top of a library ladder far from me handling heavy
volumes:

"Mr. Gladstone, I find here a book 'Dunfermline Worthies,' by a friend
of my father's. I knew some of the worthies when a child."

"Yes," he replied, "and if you will pass your hand three or four books
to the left I think you will find another book by a Dunfermline man."

I did so and saw my book "An American Four-in-Hand in Britain." Ere I
had done so, however, I heard that organ voice orating in full swing
from the top of the ladder:

"What Mecca is to the Mohammedan, Benares to the Hindoo, Jerusalem to
the Christian, all that Dunfermline is to me."

My ears heard the voice some moments before my brain realized that
these were my own words called forth by the first glimpse caught of
Dunfermline as we approached it from the south.[66]

[Footnote 66: The whole paragraph is as follows: "How beautiful is
Dunfermline seen from the Ferry Hills, its grand old Abbey towering
over all, seeming to hallow the city, and to lend a charm and dignity
to the lowliest tenement! Nor is there in all broad Scotland, nor in
many places elsewhere that I know of, a more varied and delightful
view than that obtained from the Park upon a fine day. What Benares is
to the Hindoo, Mecca to the Mohammedan, Jerusalem to the Christian,
all that Dunfermline is to me." (_An American Four-in-Hand in
Britain_, p. 282.)]

"How on earth did you come to get this book?" I asked. "I had not the
honor of knowing you when it was written and could not have sent you a
copy."

"No!" he replied, "I had not then the pleasure of your acquaintance,
but some one, I think Rosebery, told me of the book and I sent for it
and read it with delight. That tribute to Dunfermline struck me as so
extraordinary it lingered with me. I could never forget it."

This incident occurred eight years after the "American Four-in-Hand"
was written, and adds another to the many proofs of Mr. Gladstone's
wonderful memory. Perhaps as a vain author I may be pardoned for
confessing my grateful appreciation of his no less wonderful judgment.

[Illustration: _Photograph from Underwood & Underwood, N.Y._

WILLIAM E. GLADSTONE]

The politician who figures publicly as "reader of the lesson" on
Sundays, is apt to be regarded suspiciously. I confess that until I
had known Mr. Gladstone well, I had found the thought arising now and
then that the wary old gentleman might feel at least that these
appearances cost him no votes. But all this vanished as I learned his
true character. He was devout and sincere if ever man was. Yes, even
when he records in his diary (referred to by Morley in his "Life of
Gladstone") that, while addressing the House of Commons on the budget
for several hours with great acceptance, he was "conscious of being
sustained by the Divine Power above." Try as one may, who can deny
that to one of such abounding faith this belief in the support of the
Unknown Power must really have proved a sustaining influence,
although it may shock others to think that any mortal being could be
so bold as to imagine that the Creator of the Universe would concern
himself about Mr. Gladstone's budget, prepared for a little speck of
this little speck of earth? It seems almost sacrilegious, yet to Mr.
Gladstone we know it was the reverse--a religious belief such as has
no doubt often enabled men to accomplish wonders as direct agents of
God and doing His work.

On the night of the Queen's Jubilee in June, 1887, Mr. Blaine and I
were to dine at Lord Wolverton's in Piccadilly, to meet Mr. and Mrs.
Gladstone--Mr. Blaine's first introduction to him. We started in a cab
from the Metropole Hotel in good time, but the crowds were so dense
that the cab had to be abandoned in the middle of St. James's Street.
Reaching the pavement, Mr. Blaine following, I found a policeman and
explained to him who my companion was, where we were going, and asked
him if he could not undertake to get us there. He did so, pushing his
way through the masses with all the authority of his office and we
followed. But it was nine o'clock before we reached Lord Wolverton's.
We separated after eleven.

Mr. Gladstone explained that he and Mrs. Gladstone had been able to
reach the house by coming through Hyde Park and around the back way.
They expected to get back to their residence, then in Carlton Terrace,
in the same way. Mr. Blaine and I thought we should enjoy the streets
and take our chances of getting back to the hotel by pushing through
the crowds. We were doing this successfully and were moving slowly
with the current past the Reform Club when I heard a word or two
spoken by a voice close to the building on my right. I said to Mr.
Blaine:

"That is Mr. Gladstone's voice."

He said: "It is impossible. We have just left him returning to his
residence."

"I don't care; I recognize voices better than faces, and I am sure
that is Gladstone's."

Finally I prevailed upon him to return a few steps. We got close to
the side of the house and moved back. I came to a muffled figure and
whispered:

"What does 'Gravity' out of its bed at midnight?"

Mr. Gladstone was discovered. I told him I recognized his voice
whispering to his companion.

"And so," I said, "the real ruler comes out to see the illuminations
prepared for the nominal ruler!"

He replied: "Young man, I think it is time you were in bed."

We remained a few minutes with him, he being careful not to remove
from his head and face the cloak that covered them. It was then past
midnight and he was eighty, but, boylike, after he got Mrs. Gladstone
safely home he had determined to see the show.

The conversation at the dinner between Mr. Gladstone and Mr. Blaine
turned upon the differences in Parliamentary procedure between Britain
and America. During the evening Mr. Gladstone cross-examined Mr.
Blaine very thoroughly upon the mode of procedure of the House of
Representatives of which Mr. Blaine had been the Speaker. I saw the
"previous question," and summary rules with us for restricting
needless debate made a deep impression upon Mr. Gladstone. At
intervals the conversation took a wider range.

Mr. Gladstone was interested in more subjects than perhaps any other
man in Britain. When I was last with him in Scotland, at Mr.
Armistead's, his mind was as clear and vigorous as ever, his interest
in affairs equally strong. The topic which then interested him most,
and about which he plied me with questions, was the tall steel
buildings in our country, of which he had been reading. What puzzled
him was how it could be that the masonry of a fifth floor or sixth
story was often finished before the third or fourth. This I explained,
much to his satisfaction. In getting to the bottom of things he was
indefatigable.

Mr. Morley (although a lord he still remains as an author plain John
Morley) became one of our British friends quite early as editor of the
"Fortnightly Review," which published my first contribution to a
British periodical.[67] The friendship has widened and deepened in our
old age until we mutually confess we are very close friends to each
other.[68] We usually exchange short notes (sometimes long ones) on
Sunday afternoons as the spirit moves us. We are not alike; far from
it. We are drawn together because opposites are mutually beneficial to
each other. I am optimistic; all my ducks being swans. He is
pessimistic, looking out soberly, even darkly, upon the real dangers
ahead, and sometimes imagining vain things. He is inclined to see
"an officer in every bush." The world seems bright to me, and earth
is often a real heaven--so happy I am and so thankful to the kind
fates. Morley is seldom if ever wild about anything; his judgment is
always deliberate and his eyes are ever seeing the spots on the sun.

[Footnote 68: "Mr. Carnegie had proved his originality, fullness of
mind, and bold strength of character, as much or more in the
distribution of wealth as he had shown skill and foresight in its
acquisition. We had become known to one another more than twenty years
before through Matthew Arnold. His extraordinary freshness of spirit
easily carried Arnold, Herbert Spencer, myself, and afterwards many
others, high over an occasional crudity or haste in judgment such as
befalls the best of us in ardent hours. People with a genius for
picking up pins made as much as they liked of this: it was wiser to do
justice to his spacious feel for the great objects of the world--for
knowledge and its spread, invention, light, improvement of social
relations, equal chances to the talents, the passion for peace. These
are glorious things; a touch of exaggeration in expression is easy to
set right.... A man of high and wide and well-earned mark in his
generation." (John, Viscount Morley, in _Recollections_, vol. II, pp.
110, 112. New York, 1919.)]

VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN]

I told him the story of the pessimist whom nothing ever pleased, and
the optimist whom nothing ever displeased, being congratulated by the
angels upon their having obtained entrance to heaven. The pessimist
replied:

"Yes, very good place, but somehow or other this halo don't fit my
head exactly."

The optimist retorted by telling the story of a man being carried down
to purgatory and the Devil laying his victim up against a bank while
he got a drink at a spring--temperature very high. An old friend
accosted him:

"Well, Jim, how's this? No remedy possible; you're a gone coon sure."

The reply came: "Hush, it might be worse."

"How's that, when you are being carried down to the bottomless pit?"

"Hush"--pointing to his Satanic Majesty--"he might take a notion to
make me carry him."

Morley, like myself, was very fond of music and reveled in the morning
hour during which the organ was being played at Skibo. He was
attracted by the oratorios as also Arthur Balfour. I remember they got
tickets together for an oratorio at the Crystal Palace. Both are sane
but philosophic, and not very far apart as philosophers, I understand;
but some recent productions of Balfour send him far afield
speculatively--a field which Morley never attempts. He keeps his foot
on the firm ground and only treads where the way is cleared. No
danger of his being "lost in the woods" while searching for the path.

Morley's most astonishing announcement of recent days was in his
address to the editors of the world, assembled in London. He informed
them in effect that a few lines from Burns had done more to form and
maintain the present improved political and social conditions of the
people than all the millions of editorials ever written. This followed
a remark that there were now and then a few written or spoken words
which were in themselves events; they accomplished what they
described. Tom Paine's "Rights of Man" was mentioned as such.

Upon his arrival at Skibo after this address we talked it over. I
referred to his tribute to Burns and his six lines, and he replied
that he didn't need to tell me what lines these were.

"No," I said, "I know them by heart."

In a subsequent address, unveiling a statue of Burns in the park at
Montrose, I repeated the lines I supposed he referred to, and he
approved them. He and I, strange to say, had received the Freedom of
Montrose together years before, so we are fellow-freemen.

At last I induced Morley to visit us in America, and he made a tour
through a great part of our country in 1904. We tried to have him meet
distinguished men like himself. One day Senator Elihu Root called at
my request and Morley had a long interview with him. After the Senator
left Morley remarked to me that he had enjoyed his companion greatly,
as being the most satisfactory American statesman he had yet met. He
was not mistaken. For sound judgment and wide knowledge of our public
affairs Elihu Root has no superior.

Morley left us to pay a visit to President Roosevelt at the White
House, and spent several fruitful days in company with that
extraordinary man. Later, Morley's remark was:

"Well, I've seen two wonders in America, Roosevelt and Niagara."

That was clever and true to life--a great pair of roaring, tumbling,
dashing and splashing wonders, knowing no rest, but both doing their
appointed work, such as it is.

Morley was the best person to have the Acton library and my gift of it
to him came about in this way. When Mr. Gladstone told me the position
Lord Acton was in, I agreed, at his suggestion, to buy Acton's library
and allow it to remain for his use during life. Unfortunately, he did
not live long to enjoy it--only a few years--and then I had the
library upon my hands. I decided that Morley could make the best use
of it for himself and would certainly leave it eventually to the
proper institution. I began to tell him that I owned it when he
interrupted me, saying:

"Well, I must tell you I have known this from the day you bought it.
Mr. Gladstone couldn't keep the secret, being so overjoyed that Lord
Acton had it secure for life."

Here were he and I in close intimacy, and yet never had one mentioned
the situation to the other; but it was a surprise to me that Morley
was not surprised. This incident proved the closeness of the bond
between Gladstone and Morley--the only man he could not resist sharing
his happiness with regarding earthly affairs. Yet on theological
subjects they were far apart where Acton and Gladstone were akin.

The year after I gave the fund for the Scottish universities Morley
went to Balmoral as minister in attendance upon His Majesty, and wired
that he must see me before we sailed. We met and he informed me His
Majesty was deeply impressed with the gift to the universities and the
others I had made to my native land, and wished him to ascertain
whether there was anything in his power to bestow which I would
appreciate.

I asked: "What did you say?"

Morley replied: "I do not think so."

I said: "You are quite right, except that if His Majesty would write
me a note expressing his satisfaction with what I had done, as he has
to you, this would be deeply appreciated and handed down to my
descendants as something they would all be proud of."

This was done. The King's autograph note I have already transcribed
elsewhere in these pages.

That Skibo has proved the best of all health resorts for Morley is
indeed fortunate, for he comes to us several times each summer and is
one of the family, Lady Morley accompanying him. He is as fond of the
yacht as I am myself, and, fortunately again, it is the best medicine
for both of us. Morley is, and must always remain, "Honest John." No
prevarication with him, no nonsense, firm as a rock upon all questions
and in all emergencies; yet always looking around, fore and aft, right
and left, with a big heart not often revealed in all its tenderness,
but at rare intervals and upon fit occasion leaving no doubt of its
presence and power. And after that silence.

[Illustration: MR. CARNEGIE WITH VISCOUNT MORLEY]

[Illustration: THE CARNEGIE FAMILY AT SKIBO]

Chamberlain and Morley were fast friends as advanced radicals, and I
often met and conferred with them when in Britain. When the Home Rule
issue was raised, much interest was aroused in Britain over our
American Federal system. I was appealed to freely and delivered
public addresses in several cities, explaining and extolling our
union, many in one, the freest government of the parts producing the
strongest government of the whole. I sent Mr. Chamberlain Miss Anna L.
Dawes's "How We Are Governed," at his request for information, and had
conversations with Morley, Gladstone, and many others upon the
subject.

I had to write Mr. Morley that I did not approve of the first Home
Rule Bill for reasons which I gave. When I met Mr. Gladstone he
expressed his regret at this and a full talk ensued. I objected to the
exclusion of the Irish members from Parliament as being a practical
separation. I said we should never have allowed the Southern States to
cease sending representatives to Washington.

"What would you have done if they refused?" he asked.

"Employed all the resources of civilization--first, stopped the
mails," I replied.

He paused and repeated:

"Stop the mails." He felt the paralysis this involved and was silent,
and changed the subject.

In answer to questions as to what I should do, I always pointed out
that America had many legislatures, but only one Congress. Britain
should follow her example, one Parliament and local legislatures (not
parliaments) for Ireland, Scotland, and Wales. These should be made
states like New York and Virginia. But as Britain has no Supreme
Court, as we have, to decide upon laws passed, not only by state
legislatures but by Congress, the judicial being the final authority
and not the political, Britain should have Parliament as the one
national final authority over Irish measures. Therefore, the acts of
the local legislature of Ireland should lie for three months'
continuous session upon the table of the House of Commons, subject to
adverse action of the House, but becoming operative unless
disapproved. The provision would be a dead letter unless improper
legislation were enacted, but if there were improper legislation, then
it would be salutary. The clause, I said, was needed to assure timid
people that no secession could arise.

Urging this view upon Mr. Morley afterwards, he told me this had been
proposed to Parnell, but rejected. Mr. Gladstone might then have said:
"Very well, this provision is not needed for myself and others who
think with me, but it is needed to enable us to carry Britain with us.
I am now unable to take up the question. The responsibility is yours."

One morning at Hawarden Mrs. Gladstone said:

"William tells me he has such extraordinary conversations with you."

These he had, no doubt. He had not often, if ever, heard the breezy
talk of a genuine republican and did not understand my inability to
conceive of different hereditary ranks. It seemed strange to me that
men should deliberately abandon the name given them by their parents,
and that name the parents' name. Especially amusing were the new
titles which required the old hereditary nobles much effort to refrain
from smiling at as they greeted the newly made peer who had perhaps
bought his title for ten thousand pounds, more or less, given to the
party fund.

Mr. Blaine was with us in London and I told Mr. Gladstone he had
expressed to me his wonder and pain at seeing him in his old age hat
in hand, cold day as it was, at a garden party doing homage to titled
nobodies. Union of Church and State was touched upon, and also my
"Look Ahead," which foretells the reunion of our race owing to the
inability of the British Islands to expand. I had held that the
disestablishment of the English Church was inevitable, because among
other reasons it was an anomaly. No other part of the race had it. All
religions were fostered, none favored, in every other English-speaking
state. Mr. Gladstone asked:

"How long do you give our Established Church to live?"

My reply was I could not fix a date; he had had more experience than I
in disestablishing churches. He nodded and smiled.

When I had enlarged upon a certain relative decrease of population in
Britain that must come as compared with other countries of larger
area, he asked:

"What future do you forecast for her?"

I referred to Greece among ancient nations and said that it was,
perhaps, not accident that Chaucer, Shakespeare, Spenser, Milton,
Burns, Scott, Stevenson, Bacon, Cromwell, Wallace, Bruce, Hume, Watt,
Spencer, Darwin, and other celebrities had arisen here. Genius did not
depend upon material resources. Long after Britain could not figure
prominently as an industrial nation, not by her decline, but through
the greater growth of others, she might in my opinion become the
modern Greece and achieve among nations moral ascendancy.

He caught at the words, repeating them musingly:

"Moral ascendancy, moral ascendancy, I like that, I like that."

I had never before so thoroughly enjoyed a conference with a man. I
visited him again at Hawarden, but my last visit to him was at Lord
Randall's at Cannes the winter of 1897 when he was suffering keenly.
He had still the old charm and was especially attentive to my
sister-in-law, Lucy, who saw him then for the first time and was
deeply impressed. As we drove off, she murmured, "A sick eagle! A sick
eagle!" Nothing could better describe this wan and worn leader of men
as he appeared to me that day. He was not only a great, but a truly
good man, stirred by the purest impulses, a high, imperious soul
always looking upward. He had, indeed, earned the title: "Foremost
Citizen of the World."

In Britain, in 1881, I had entered into business relations with Samuel
Storey, M.P., a very able man, a stern radical, and a genuine
republican. We purchased several British newspapers and began a
campaign of political progress upon radical lines. Passmore Edwards
and some others joined us, but the result was not encouraging. Harmony
did not prevail among my British friends and finally I decided to
withdraw, which I was fortunately able to do without loss.[69]

[Footnote 69: Mr. Carnegie acquired no less than eighteen British
newspapers with the idea of promoting radical views. The political
results were disappointing, but with his genius for making money the
pecuniary results were more than satisfactory.]

My third literary venture, "Triumphant Democracy,"[70] had its origin
in realizing how little the best-informed foreigner, or even Briton,
knew of America, and how distorted that little was. It was prodigious
what these eminent Englishmen did not then know about the Republic. My
first talk with Mr. Gladstone in 1882 can never be forgotten. When I
had occasion to say that the majority of the English-speaking race was
now republican and it was a minority of monarchists who were upon the
defensive, he said:

"Why, how is that?"

"Well, Mr. Gladstone," I said, "the Republic holds sway over a larger
number of English-speaking people than the population of Great Britain
and all her colonies even if the English-speaking colonies were
numbered twice over."

"Ah! how is that? What is your population?"

"Sixty-six millions, and yours is not much more than half."

"Ah, yes, surprising!"

[Footnote 70: _Triumphant Democracy, or Fifty Years' March of the
Republic._ London, 1886; New York, 1888.]

With regard to the wealth of the nations, it was equally surprising
for him to learn that the census of 1880 proved the hundred-year-old
Republic could purchase Great Britain and Ireland and all their
realized capital and investments and then pay off Britain's debt, and
yet not exhaust her fortune. But the most startling statement of all
was that which I was able to make when the question of Free Trade was
touched upon. I pointed out that America was now the greatest
manufacturing nation in the world. [At a later date I remember Lord
Chancellor Haldane fell into the same error, calling Britain the
greatest manufacturing country in the world, and thanked me for
putting him right.] I quoted Mulhall's figures: British manufactures
in 1880, eight hundred and sixteen millions sterling; American
manufactures eleven hundred and twenty-six millions sterling.[71] His
one word was:

"Incredible!"

[Footnote 71: The estimated value of manufactures in Great Britain in
1900 was five billions of dollars as compared to thirteen billions for
the United States. In 1914 the United States had gone to over
twenty-four billions.]

Other startling statements followed and he asked:

"Why does not some writer take up this subject and present the facts
in a simple and direct form to the world?"

I was then, as a matter of fact, gathering material for "Triumphant
Democracy," in which I intended to perform the very service which he
indicated, as I informed him.

"Round the World" and the "American Four-in-Hand" gave me not the
slightest effort but the preparation of "Triumphant Democracy," which
I began in 1882, was altogether another matter. It required steady,
laborious work. Figures had to be examined and arranged, but as I went
forward the study became fascinating. For some months I seemed to have
my head filled with statistics. The hours passed away unheeded. It was
evening when I supposed it was midday. The second serious illness of
my life dates from the strain brought upon me by this work, for I had
to attend to business as well. I shall think twice before I trust
myself again with anything so fascinating as figures.




CHAPTER XXV

HERBERT SPENCER AND HIS DISCIPLE


Herbert Spencer, with his friend Mr. Lott and myself, were fellow
travelers on the Servia from Liverpool to New York in 1882. I bore a
note of introduction to him from Mr. Morley, but I had met the
philosopher in London before that. I was one of his disciples. As an
older traveler, I took Mr. Lott and him in charge. We sat at the same
table during the voyage.

One day the conversation fell upon the impression made upon us by
great men at first meeting. Did they, or did they not, prove to be as
we had imagined them? Each gave his experience. Mine was that nothing
could be more different than the being imagined and that being beheld
in the flesh.

"Oh!" said Mr. Spencer, "in my case, for instance, was this so?"

"Yes," I replied, "you more than any. I had imagined my teacher, the
great calm philosopher brooding, Buddha-like, over all things,
unmoved; never did I dream of seeing him excited over the question of
Cheshire or Cheddar cheese." The day before he had peevishly pushed
away the former when presented by the steward, exclaiming "Cheddar,
Cheddar, not Cheshire; I said _Cheddar_." There was a roar in which
none joined more heartily than the sage himself. He refers to this
incident of the voyage in his Autobiography.[72]

[Footnote 72: _An Autobiography_, by Herbert Spencer, vol. I, p. 424.
New York, 1904.]

Spencer liked stories and was a good laugher. American stories seemed
to please him more than others, and of those I was able to tell him
not a few, which were usually followed by explosive laughter. He was
anxious to learn about our Western Territories, which were then
attracting attention in Europe, and a story I told him about Texas
struck him as amusing. When a returning disappointed emigrant from
that State was asked about the then barren country, he said:

"Stranger, all that I have to say about Texas is that if I owned Texas
and h--l, I would sell Texas."

What a change from those early days! Texas has now over four millions
of population and is said to have the soil to produce more cotton than
the whole world did in 1882.

The walk up to the house, when I had the philosopher out at
Pittsburgh, reminded me of another American story of the visitor who
started to come up the garden walk. When he opened the gate a big dog
from the house rushed down upon him. He retreated and closed the
garden gate just in time, the host calling out:

"He won't touch you, you know barking dogs never bite."

"Yes," exclaimed the visitor, tremblingly, "I know that and you know
it, but does the dog know it?"

One day my eldest nephew was seen to open the door quietly and peep in
where we were seated. His mother afterwards asked him why he had done
so and the boy of eleven replied:

"Mamma, I wanted to see the man who wrote in a book that there was no
use studying grammar."

Spencer was greatly pleased when he heard the story and often referred
to it. He had faith in that nephew.

[Illustration: HERBERT SPENCER AT SEVENTY-EIGHT]

Speaking to him one day about his having signed a remonstrance against
a tunnel between Calais and Dover as having surprised me, he explained
that for himself he was as anxious to have the tunnel as any one
and that he did not believe in any of the objections raised against
it, but signed the remonstrance because he knew his countrymen were
such fools that the military and naval element in Britain could
stampede the masses, frighten them, and stimulate militarism. An
increased army and navy would then be demanded. He referred to a scare
which had once arisen and involved the outlay of many millions in
fortifications which had proved useless.

One day we were sitting in our rooms in the Grand Hotel looking out
over Trafalgar Square. The Life Guards passed and the following took
place:

"Mr. Spencer, I never see men dressed up like Merry Andrews without
being saddened and indignant that in the nineteenth century the most
civilized race, as we consider ourselves, still finds men willing to
adopt as a profession--until lately the only profession for
gentlemen--the study of the surest means of killing other men."

Mr. Spencer said: "I feel just so myself, but I will tell you how I
curb my indignation. Whenever I feel it rising I am calmed by this
story of Emerson's: He had been hooted and hustled from the platform
in Faneuil Hall for daring to speak against slavery. He describes
himself walking home in violent anger, until opening his garden gate
and looking up through the branches of the tall elms that grew between
the gate and his modest home, he saw the stars shining through. They
said to him: 'What, so hot, my little sir?'" I laughed and he laughed,
and I thanked him for that story. Not seldom I have to repeat to
myself, "What, so hot, my little sir?" and it suffices.

Mr. Spencer's visit to America had its climax in the banquet given
for him at Delmonico's. I drove him to it and saw the great man there
in a funk. He could think of nothing but the address he was to
deliver.[73] I believe he had rarely before spoken in public. His
great fear was that he should be unable to say anything that would be
of advantage to the American people, who had been the first to
appreciate his works. He may have attended many banquets, but never
one comprised of more distinguished people than this one. It was a
remarkable gathering. The tributes paid Spencer by the ablest men were
unique. The climax was reached when Henry Ward Beecher, concluding his
address, turned round and addressed Mr. Spencer in these words:

"To my father and my mother I owe my physical being; to you, sir, I
owe my intellectual being. At a critical moment you provided the safe
paths through the bogs and morasses; you were my teacher."

[Footnote 73: "An occasion, on which more, perhaps, than any other in
my life, I ought to have been in good condition, bodily and mentally,
came when I was in a condition worse than I had been for six and
twenty years. 'Wretched night; no sleep at all; kept in my room all
day' says my diary, and I entertained 'great fear I should collapse.'
When the hour came for making my appearance at Delmonico's, where the
dinner was given, I got my friends to secrete me in an anteroom until
the last moment, so that I might avoid all excitements of
introductions and congratulations; and as Mr. Evarts, who presided,
handed me on the dais, I begged him to limit his conversation with me
as much as possible, and to expect very meagre responses. The event
proved that, trying though the tax was, there did not result the
disaster I feared; and when Mr. Evarts had duly uttered the
compliments of the occasion, I was able to get through my prepared
speech without difficulty, though not with much effect." (Spencer's
_Autobiography_, vol. II, p. 478.)]

These words were spoken in slow, solemn tones. I do not remember ever
having noticed more depth of feeling; evidently they came from a
grateful debtor. Mr. Spencer was touched by the words. They gave rise
to considerable remark, and shortly afterwards Mr. Beecher preached a
course of sermons, giving his views upon Evolution. The conclusion of
the series was anxiously looked for, because his acknowledgment of
debt to Spencer as his teacher had created alarm in church circles. In
the concluding article, as in his speech, if I remember rightly, Mr.
Beecher said that, although he believed in evolution (Darwinism) up to
a certain point, yet when man had reached his highest human level his
Creator then invested him (and man alone of all living things) with
the Holy Spirit, thereby bringing him into the circle of the godlike.
Thus he answered his critics.

Mr. Spencer took intense interest in mechanical devices. When he
visited our works with me the new appliances impressed him, and in
after years he sometimes referred to these and said his estimate of
American invention and push had been fully realized. He was naturally
pleased with the deference and attention paid him in America.

I seldom if ever visited England without going to see him, even after
he had removed to Brighton that he might live looking out upon the
sea, which appealed to and soothed him. I never met a man who seemed
to weigh so carefully every action, every word--even the pettiest--and
so completely to find guidance through his own conscience. He was no
scoffer in religious matters. In the domain of theology, however, he
had little regard for decorum. It was to him a very faulty system
hindering true growth, and the idea of rewards and punishments struck
him as an appeal to very low natures indeed. Still he never went to
such lengths as Tennyson did upon an occasion when some of the old
ideas were under discussion. Knowles[74] told me that Tennyson lost
control of himself. Knowles said he was greatly disappointed with the
son's life of the poet as giving no true picture of his father in his
revolt against stern theology.

[Footnote 74: James Knowles, founder of _Nineteenth Century_.]

Spencer was always the calm philosopher. I believe that from childhood
to old age--when the race was run--he never was guilty of an immoral
act or did an injustice to any human being. He was certainly one of
the most conscientious men in all his doings that ever was born. Few
men have wished to know another man more strongly than I to know
Herbert Spencer, for seldom has one been more deeply indebted than I
to him and to Darwin.

Reaction against the theology of past days comes to many who have been
surrounded in youth by church people entirely satisfied that the truth
and faith indispensable to future happiness were derived only through
strictest Calvinistic creeds. The thoughtful youth is naturally
carried along and disposed to concur in this. He cannot but think, up
to a certain period of development, that what is believed by the best
and the highest educated around him--those to whom he looks for
example and instruction--must be true. He resists doubt as inspired by
the Evil One seeking his soul, and sure to get it unless faith comes
to the rescue. Unfortunately he soon finds that faith is not exactly
at his beck and call. Original sin he thinks must be at the root of
this inability to see as he wishes to see, to believe as he wishes to
believe. It seems clear to him that already he is little better than
one of the lost. Of the elect he surely cannot be, for these must be
ministers, elders, and strictly orthodox men.

The young man is soon in chronic rebellion, trying to assume godliness
with the others, acquiescing outwardly in the creed and all its
teachings, and yet at heart totally unable to reconcile his outward
accordance with his inward doubt. If there be intellect and virtue in
the man but one result is possible; that is, Carlyle's position after
his terrible struggle when after weeks of torment he came forth: "If
it be incredible, in God's name, then, let it be discredited." With
that the load of doubt and fear fell from him forever.

When I, along with three or four of my boon companions, was in this
stage of doubt about theology, including the supernatural element, and
indeed the whole scheme of salvation through vicarious atonement and
all the fabric built upon it, I came fortunately upon Darwin's and
Spencer's works "The Data of Ethics," "First Principles," "Social
Statics," "The Descent of Man." Reaching the pages which explain how
man has absorbed such mental foods as were favorable to him, retaining
what was salutary, rejecting what was deleterious, I remember that
light came as in a flood and all was clear. Not only had I got rid of
theology and the supernatural, but I had found the truth of evolution.
"All is well since all grows better" became my motto, my true source
of comfort. Man was not created with an instinct for his own
degradation, but from the lower he had risen to the higher forms. Nor
is there any conceivable end to his march to perfection. His face is
turned to the light; he stands in the sun and looks upward.

Humanity is an organism, inherently rejecting all that is deleterious,
that is, wrong, and absorbing after trial what is beneficial, that is,
right. If so disposed, the Architect of the Universe, we must assume,
might have made the world and man perfect, free from evil and from
pain, as angels in heaven are thought to be; but although this was not
done, man has been given the power of advancement rather than of
retrogression. The Old and New Testaments remain, like other sacred
writings of other lands, of value as records of the past and for such
good lessons as they inculcate. Like the ancient writers of the Bible
our thoughts should rest upon this life and our duties here. "To
perform the duties of this world well, troubling not about another, is
the prime wisdom," says Confucius, great sage and teacher. The next
world and its duties we shall consider when we are placed in it.

I am as a speck of dust in the sun, and not even so much, in this
solemn, mysterious, unknowable universe. I shrink back. One truth I
see. Franklin was right. "The highest worship of God is service to
Man." All this, however, does not prevent everlasting hope of
immortality. It would be no greater miracle to be born to a future
life than to have been born to live in this present life. The one has
been created, why not the other? Therefore there is reason to hope for
immortality. Let us hope.[75]

[Footnote 75: "A.C. is really a tremendous personality--dramatic,
wilful, generous, whimsical, at times almost cruel in pressing his own
conviction upon others, and then again tender, affectionate,
emotional, always imaginative, unusual and wide-visioned in his views.
He is well worth Boswellizing, but I am urging him to be 'his own
Boswell.'... He is inconsistent in many ways, but with a passion for
lofty views; the brotherhood of man, peace among nations, religious
purity--I mean the purification of religion from gross
superstition--the substitution for a Westminster-Catechism God, of a
Righteous, a Just God." (_Letters of Richard Watson Gilder_, p. 375.)]




CHAPTER XXVI

BLAINE AND HARRISON


While one is known by the company he keeps, it is equally true that
one is known by the stories he tells. Mr. Blaine was one of the best
story-tellers I ever met. His was a bright sunny nature with a witty,
pointed story for every occasion.

Mr. Blaine's address at Yorktown (I had accompanied him there) was
greatly admired. It directed special attention to the cordial
friendship which had grown up between the two branches of the
English-speaking race, and ended with the hope that the prevailing
peace and good-will between the two nations would exist for many
centuries to come. When he read this to me, I remember that the word
"many" jarred, and I said:

"Mr. Secretary, might I suggest the change of one word? I don't like
'many'; why not 'all' the centuries to come?"

"Good, that is perfect!"

And so it was given in the address: "for _all_ the centuries to come."

We had a beautiful night returning from Yorktown, and, sitting in the
stern of the ship in the moonlight, the military band playing forward,
we spoke of the effect of music. Mr. Blaine said that his favorite
just then was the "Sweet By and By," which he had heard played last by
the same band at President Garfield's funeral, and he thought upon
that occasion he was more deeply moved by sweet sounds than he had
ever been in his life. He requested that it should be the last piece
played that night. Both he and Gladstone were fond of simple music.
They could enjoy Beethoven and the classic masters, but Wagner was as
yet a sealed book to them.

In answer to my inquiry as to the most successful speech he ever heard
in Congress, he replied it was that of the German, ex-Governor Ritter
of Pennsylvania. The first bill appropriating money for inland _fresh_
waters was under consideration. The house was divided. Strict
constructionists held this to be unconstitutional; only harbors upon
the salt sea were under the Federal Government. The contest was keen
and the result doubtful, when to the astonishment of the House,
Governor Ritter slowly arose for the first time. Silence at once
reigned. What was the old German ex-Governor going to say--he who had
never said anything at all? Only this:

"Mr. Speaker, I don't know much particulars about de constitution, but
I know dis; I wouldn't gif a d----d cent for a constitution dat didn't
wash in fresh water as well as in salt." The House burst into an
uproar of uncontrollable laughter, and the bill passed.

So came about this new departure and one of the most beneficent ways
of spending government money, and of employing army and navy
engineers. Little of the money spent by the Government yields so great
a return. So expands our flexible constitution to meet the new wants
of an expanding population. Let who will make the constitution if we
of to-day are permitted to interpret it.

JAMES G. BLAINE]

Mr. Blaine's best story, if one can be selected from so many that were
excellent, I think was the following:

In the days of slavery and the underground railroads, there lived on
the banks of the Ohio River near Gallipolis, a noted Democrat named
Judge French, who said to some anti-slavery friends that he should
like them to bring to his office the first runaway negro that crossed
the river, bound northward by the underground. He couldn't understand
why they wished to run away. This was done, and the following
conversation took place:

_Judge:_ "So you have run away from Kentucky. Bad master, I suppose?"

_Slave:_ "Oh, no, Judge; very good, kind massa."

_Judge:_ "He worked you too hard?"

_Slave:_ "No, sah, never overworked myself all my life."

_Judge, hesitatingly:_ "He did not give you enough to eat?"

_Slave:_ "Not enough to eat down in Kaintuck? Oh, Lor', plenty to
eat."

_Judge:_ "He did not clothe you well?"

_Slave:_ "Good enough clothes for me, Judge."

_Judge:_ "You hadn't a comfortable home?"

_Slave:_ "Oh, Lor', makes me cry to think of my pretty little cabin
down dar in old Kaintuck."

_Judge, after a pause:_ "You had a good, kind master, you were not
overworked, plenty to eat, good clothes, fine home. I don't see why
the devil you wished to run away."

_Slave:_ "Well, Judge, I lef de situation down dar open. You kin go
rite down and git it."

The Judge had seen a great light.

    "Freedom has a thousand charms to show,
    That slaves, howe'er contented, never know."

That the colored people in such numbers risked all for liberty is the
best possible proof that they will steadily approach and finally reach
the full stature of citizenship in the Republic.

I never saw Mr. Blaine so happy as while with us at Cluny. He was a
boy again and we were a rollicking party together. He had never fished
with a fly. I took him out on Loch Laggan and he began awkwardly, as
all do, but he soon caught the swing. I shall never forget his first
capture:

"My friend, you have taught me a new pleasure in life. There are a
hundred fishing lochs in Maine, and I'll spend my holidays in future
upon them trout-fishing."

At Cluny there is no night in June and we danced on the lawn in the
bright twilight until late. Mrs. Blaine, Miss Dodge, Mr. Blaine, and
other guests were trying to do the Scotch reel, and "whooping" like
Highlanders. We were gay revelers during those two weeks. One night
afterwards, at a dinner in our home in New York, chiefly made up of
our Cluny visitors, Mr. Blaine told the company that he had discovered
at Cluny what a real holiday was. "It is when the merest trifles
become the most serious events of life."

President Harrison's nomination for the presidency in 1888 came to Mr.
Blaine while on a coaching trip with us. Mr. and Mrs. Blaine, Miss
Margaret Blaine, Senator and Mrs. Hale, Miss Dodge, and Walter
Damrosch were on the coach with us from London to Cluny Castle. In
approaching Linlithgow from Edinburgh, we found the provost and
magistrates in their gorgeous robes at the hotel to receive us. I was
with them when Mr. Blaine came into the room with a cablegram in his
hand which he showed to me, asking what it meant. It read: "Use
cipher." It was from Senator Elkins at the Chicago Convention. Mr.
Blaine had cabled the previous day, declining to accept the nomination
for the presidency unless Secretary Sherman of Ohio agreed, and
Senator Elkins no doubt wished to be certain that he was in
correspondence with Mr. Blaine and not with some interloper.

I said to Mr. Blaine that the Senator had called to see me before
sailing, and suggested we should have cipher words for the prominent
candidates. I gave him a few and kept a copy upon a slip, which I put
in my pocket-book. I looked and fortunately found it. Blaine was
"Victor"; Harrison, "Trump"; Phelps of New Jersey, "Star"; and so on.
I wired "Trump" and "Star."[76] This was in the evening.

[Footnote 76: "A code had been agreed upon between his friends in the
United States and himself, and when a deadlock or a long contest
seemed inevitable, the following dispatch was sent from Mr. Carnegie's
estate in Scotland, where Blaine was staying, to a prominent
Republican leader:

"'June 25. Too late victor immovable take trump and star.'
WHIP. Interpreted, it reads: 'Too late. Blaine immovable.
Take Harrison and Phelps. CARNEGIE.'" (_James G. Blaine_, by
Edward Stanwood, p. 308. Boston, 1905.)]

We retired for the night, and next day the whole party was paraded by
the city authorities in their robes up the main street to the palace
grounds which were finely decorated with flags. Speeches of welcome
were made and replied to. Mr. Blaine was called upon by the people,
and responded in a short address. Just then a cablegram was handed to
him: "Harrison and Morton nominated." Phelps had declined. So passed
forever Mr. Blaine's chance of holding the highest of all political
offices--the elected of the majority of the English-speaking race. But
he was once fairly elected to the presidency and done out of New York
State, as was at last clearly proven, the perpetrators having been
punished for an attempted repetition of the same fraud at a subsequent
election.

Mr. Blaine, as Secretary of State in Harrison's Cabinet, was a decided
success and the Pan-American Congress his most brilliant triumph. My
only political appointment came at this time and was that of a United
States delegate to the Congress. It gave me a most interesting view of
the South American Republics and their various problems. We sat down
together, representatives of all the republics but Brazil. One morning
the announcement was made that a new constitution had been ratified.
Brazil had become a member of the sisterhood, making seventeen
republics in all--now twenty-one. There was great applause and cordial
greeting of the representatives of Brazil thus suddenly elevated. I
found the South American representatives rather suspicious of their
big brother's intentions. A sensitive spirit of independence was
manifest, which it became our duty to recognize. In this I think we
succeeded, but it will behoove subsequent governments to scrupulously
respect the national feeling of our Southern neighbors. It is not
control, but friendly coöperation upon terms of perfect equality we
should seek.

I sat next to Manuel Quintana who afterwards became President of
Argentina. He took a deep interest in the proceedings, and one day
became rather critical upon a trifling issue, which led to an excited
colloquy between him and Chairman Blaine. I believe it had its origin
in a false translation from one language to another. I rose, slipped
behind the chairman on the platform, whispering to him as I passed
that if an adjournment was moved I was certain the differences could
be adjusted. He nodded assent. I returned to my seat and moved
adjournment, and during the interval all was satisfactorily arranged.
Passing the delegates, as we were about to leave the hall, an incident
occurred which comes back to me as I write. A delegate threw one arm
around me and with the other hand patting me on the breast, exclaimed:
"Mr. Carnegie, you have more here than here"--pointing to his pocket.
Our Southern brethren are so lovingly demonstrative. Warm climes and
warm hearts.

In 1891 President Harrison went with me from Washington to Pittsburgh,
as I have already stated, to open the Carnegie Hall and Library, which
I had presented to Allegheny City. We traveled over the Baltimore and
Ohio Railroad by daylight, and enjoyed the trip, the president being
especially pleased with the scenery. Reaching Pittsburgh at dark, the
flaming coke ovens and dense pillars of smoke and fire amazed him. The
well-known description of Pittsburgh, seen from the hilltops, as "H--l
with the lid off," seemed to him most appropriate. He was the first
President who ever visited Pittsburgh. President Harrison, his
grandfather, had, however, passed from steamboat to canal-boat there,
on his way to Washington after election.

The opening ceremony was largely attended owing to the presence of the
President and all passed off well. Next morning the President wished
to see our steel works, and he was escorted there, receiving a cordial
welcome from the workmen. I called up each successive manager of
department as we passed and presented him. Finally, when Mr. Schwab
was presented, the President turned to me and said,

"How is this, Mr. Carnegie? You present only boys to me."

"Yes, Mr. President, but do you notice what kind of boys they are?"

"Yes, hustlers, every one of them," was his comment.

He was right. No such young men could have been found for such work
elsewhere in this world. They had been promoted to partnership without
cost or risk. If the profits did not pay for their shares, no
responsibility remained upon the young men. A giving thus to
"partners" is very different from paying wages to "employees" in
corporations.

The President's visit, not to Pittsburgh, but to Allegheny over the
river, had one beneficial result. Members of the City Council of
Pittsburgh reminded me that I had first offered Pittsburgh money for a
library and hall, which it declined, and that then Allegheny City had
asked if I would give them to her, which I did. The President visiting
Allegheny to open the library and hall there, and the ignoring of
Pittsburgh, was too much. Her authorities came to me again the morning
after the Allegheny City opening, asking if I would renew my offer to
Pittsburgh. If so, the city would accept and agree to expend upon
maintenance a larger percentage than I had previously asked. I was
only too happy to do this and, instead of two hundred and fifty
thousand, I offered a million dollars. My ideas had expanded. Thus was
started the Carnegie Institute.

Pittsburgh's leading citizens are spending freely upon artistic
things. This center of manufacturing has had its permanent orchestra
for some years--Boston and Chicago being the only other cities in
America that can boast of one. A naturalist club and a school of
painting have sprung up. The success of Library, Art Gallery, Museum,
and Music Hall--a noble quartet in an immense building--is one of the
chief satisfactions of my life. This is my monument, because here I
lived my early life and made my start, and I am to-day in heart a
devoted son of dear old smoky Pittsburgh.

Herbert Spencer heard, while with us in Pittsburgh, some account of
the rejection of my first offer of a library to Pittsburgh. When the
second offer was made, he wrote me that he did not understand how I
could renew it; he never could have done so; they did not deserve it.
I wrote the philosopher that if I had made the first offer to
Pittsburgh that I might receive her thanks and gratitude, I deserved
the personal arrows shot at me and the accusations made that only my
own glorification and a monument to my memory were sought. I should
then probably have felt as he did. But, as it was the good of the
people of Pittsburgh I had in view, among whom I had made my fortune,
the unfounded suspicions of some natures only quickened my desire to
work their good by planting in their midst a potent influence for
higher things. This the Institute, thank the kind fates, has done.
Pittsburgh has played her part nobly.




CHAPTER XXVII

WASHINGTON DIPLOMACY


President Harrison had been a soldier and as President was a little
disposed to fight. His attitude gave some of his friends concern. He
was opposed to arbitrating the Behring Sea question when Lord
Salisbury, at the dictation of Canada, had to repudiate the Blaine
agreement for its settlement, and was disposed to proceed to extreme
measures. But calmer counsels prevailed. He was determined also to
uphold the Force Bill against the South.

When the quarrel arose with Chili, there was a time when it seemed
almost impossible to keep the President from taking action which would
have resulted in war. He had great personal provocation because the
Chilian authorities had been most indiscreet in their statements in
regard to his action. I went to Washington to see whether I could not
do something toward reconciling the belligerents, because, having been
a member of the first Pan-American Conference, I had become acquainted
with the representatives from our southern sister-republics and was on
good terms with them.

As luck would have it, I was just entering the Shoreham Hotel when I
saw Senator Henderson of Missouri, who had been my fellow-delegate to
the Conference. He stopped and greeted me, and looking across the
street he said:

"There's the President beckoning to you."

I crossed the street.

"Hello, Carnegie, when did you arrive?"

"Just arrived, Mr. President; I was entering the hotel."

"What are you here for?"

"To have a talk with you."

"Well, come along and talk as we walk."

The President took my arm and we promenaded the streets of Washington
in the dusk for more than an hour, during which time the discussion
was lively. I told him that he had appointed me a delegate to the
Pan-American Conference, that he had assured the South-American
delegates when they parted that he had given a military review in
their honor to show them, not that we had an army, but rather that we
had none and needed none, that we were the big brother in the family
of republics, and that all disputes, if any arose, would be settled by
peaceful arbitration. I was therefore surprised and grieved to find
that he was now apparently taking a different course, threatening to
resort to war in a paltry dispute with little Chili.

"You're a New Yorker and think of nothing but business and dollars.
That is the way with New Yorkers; they care nothing for the dignity
and honor of the Republic," said his Excellency.

"Mr. President, I am one of the men in the United States who would
profit most by war; it might throw millions into my pockets as the
largest manufacturer of steel."

"Well, that is probably true in your case; I had forgotten."

"Mr. President, if I were going to fight, I would take some one of my
size."

"Well, would you let any nation insult and dishonor you because of its
size?"

"Mr. President, no man can dishonor me except myself. Honor wounds
must be self-inflicted."

"You see our sailors were attacked on shore and two of them killed,
and you would stand that?" he asked.

"Mr. President, I do not think the United States dishonored every time
a row among drunken sailors takes place; besides, these were not
American sailors at all; they were foreigners, as you see by their
names. I would be disposed to cashier the captain of that ship for
allowing the sailors to go on shore when there was rioting in the town
and the public peace had been already disturbed."

The discussion continued until we had finally reached the door of the
White House in the dark. The President told me he had an engagement to
dine out that night, but invited me to dine with him the next evening,
when, as he said, there would be only the family and we could talk.

"I am greatly honored and shall be with you to-morrow evening," I
said. And so we parted.

The next morning I went over to see Mr. Blaine, then Secretary of
State. He rose from his seat and held out both hands.

"Oh, why weren't you dining with us last night? When the President
told Mrs. Blaine that you were in town, she said: 'Just think, Mr.
Carnegie is in town and I had a vacant seat here he could have
occupied.'"

"Well, Mr. Blaine, I think it is rather fortunate that I have not seen
you," I replied; and I then told him what had occurred with the
President.

"Yes," he said, "it really was fortunate. The President might have
thought you and I were in collusion."

Senator Elkins, of West Virginia, a bosom friend of Mr. Blaine, and
also a very good friend of the President, happened to come in, and he
said he had seen the President, who told him that he had had a talk
with me upon the Chilian affair last evening and that I had come down
hot upon the subject.

"Well, Mr. President," said Senator Elkins, "it is not probable that
Mr. Carnegie would speak as plainly to you as he would to me. He feels
very keenly, but he would naturally be somewhat reserved in talking to
you."

The President replied: "I didn't see the slightest indication of
reserve, I assure you."

The matter was adjusted, thanks to the peace policy characteristic of
Mr. Blaine. More than once he kept the United States out of foreign
trouble as I personally knew. The reputation that he had of being an
aggressive American really enabled that great man to make concessions
which, made by another, might not have been readily accepted by the
people.

I had a long and friendly talk with the President that evening at
dinner, but he was not looking at all well. I ventured to say to him
he needed a rest. By all means he should get away. He said he had
intended going off on a revenue cutter for a few days, but Judge
Bradley of the Supreme Court had died and he must find a worthy
successor. I said there was one I could not recommend because we had
fished together and were such intimate friends that we could not judge
each other disinterestedly, but he might inquire about him--Mr.
Shiras, of Pittsburgh. He did so and appointed him. Mr. Shiras
received the strong support of the best elements everywhere. Neither
my recommendation, nor that of any one else, would have weighed with
President Harrison one particle in making the appointment if he had
not found Mr. Shiras the very man he wanted.

In the Behring Sea dispute the President was incensed at Lord
Salisbury's repudiation of the stipulations for settling the question
which had been agreed to. The President had determined to reject the
counter-proposition to submit it to arbitration. Mr. Blaine was with
the President in this and naturally indignant that his plan, which
Salisbury had extolled through his Ambassador, had been discarded. I
found both of them in no compromising mood. The President was much the
more excited of the two, however. Talking it over with Mr. Blaine
alone, I explained to him that Salisbury was powerless. Against
Canada's protest he could not force acceptance of the stipulations to
which he had hastily agreed. There was another element. He had a
dispute with Newfoundland on hand, which the latter was insisting must
be settled to her advantage. No Government in Britain could add
Canadian dissatisfaction to that of Newfoundland. Salisbury had done
the best he could. After a while Blaine was convinced of this and
succeeded in bringing the President into line.

The Behring Sea troubles brought about some rather amusing situations.
One day Sir John Macdonald, Canadian Premier, and his party reached
Washington and asked Mr. Blaine to arrange an interview with the
President upon this subject. Mr. Blaine replied that he would see the
President and inform Sir John the next morning.

"Of course," said Mr. Blaine, telling me the story in Washington just
after the incident occurred, "I knew very well that the President
could not meet Sir John and his friends officially, and when they
called I told them so." Sir John said that Canada was independent, "as
sovereign as the State of New York was in the Union." Mr. Blaine
replied he was afraid that if he ever obtained an interview as Premier
of Canada with the State authorities of New York he would soon hear
something on the subject from Washington; and so would the New York
State authorities.

It was because the President and Mr. Blaine were convinced that the
British Government at home could not fulfill the stipulations agreed
upon that they accepted Salisbury's proposal for arbitration,
believing he had done his best. That was a very sore disappointment to
Mr. Blaine. He had suggested that Britain and America should each
place two small vessels on Behring Sea with equal rights to board or
arrest fishing vessels under either flag--in fact, a joint police
force. To give Salisbury due credit, he cabled the British Ambassador,
Sir Julian Pauncefote, to congratulate Mr. Blaine upon this "brilliant
suggestion." It would have given equal rights to each and under either
or both flags for the first time in history--a just and brotherly
compact. Sir Julian had shown this cable to Mr. Blaine. I mention this
here to suggest that able and willing statesmen, anxious to coöperate,
are sometimes unable to do so.

Mr. Blaine was indeed a great statesman, a man of wide views, sound
judgment, and always for peace. Upon war with Chili, upon the Force
Bill, and the Behring Sea question, he was calm, wise, and
peace-pursuing. Especially was he favorable to drawing closer and
closer to our own English-speaking race. For France he had gratitude
unbounded for the part she had played in our Revolutionary War, but
this did not cause him to lose his head.

One night at dinner in London Mr. Blaine was at close quarters for a
moment. The Clayton-Bulwer Treaty came up. A leading statesman present
said that the impression they had was that Mr. Blaine had always been
inimical to the Mother country. Mr. Blaine disclaimed this, and justly
so, as far as I knew his sentiments. His correspondence upon the
Clayton-Bulwer Treaty was instanced. Mr. Blaine replied:

"When I became Secretary of State and had to take up that subject I
was surprised to find that your Secretary for Foreign Affairs was
always informing us what Her Majesty 'expected,' while our Secretary
of State was telling you what our President 'ventured to hope.' When I
received a dispatch telling us what Her Majesty expected, I replied,
telling you what our President 'expected.'"

"Well, you admit you changed the character of the correspondence?" was
shot at him.

Quick as a flash came the response: "Not more than conditions had
changed. The United States had passed the stage of 'venturing to hope'
with any power that 'expects.' I only followed your example, and
should ever Her Majesty 'venture to hope,' the President will always
be found doing the same. I am afraid that as long as you 'expect' the
United States will also 'expect' in return."

One night there was a dinner, where Mr. Joseph Chamberlain and Sir
Charles Tennant, President of the Scotland Steel Company, were guests.
During the evening the former said that his friend Carnegie was a good
fellow and they all delighted to see him succeeding, but he didn't
know why the United States should give him protection worth a million
sterling per year or more, for condescending to manufacture steel
rails.

"Well," said Mr. Blaine, "we don't look at it in that light. I am
interested in railroads, and we formerly used to pay you for steel
rails ninety dollars per ton for every ton we got--nothing less. Now,
just before I sailed from home our people made a large contract with
our friend Carnegie at thirty dollars per ton. I am somewhat under
the impression that if Carnegie and others had not risked their
capital in developing their manufacture on our side of the Atlantic,
we would still be paying you ninety dollars per ton to-day."

Here Sir Charles broke in: "You may be sure you would. Ninety dollars
was our agreed-upon price for you foreigners."

Mr. Blaine smilingly remarked: "Mr. Chamberlain, I don't think you
have made a very good case against our friend Carnegie."

"No," he replied; "how could I, with Sir Charles giving me away like
that?"--and there was general laughter.

Blaine was a rare raconteur and his talk had this great merit: never
did I hear him tell a story or speak a word unsuitable for any, even
the most fastidious company to hear. He was as quick as a steel trap,
a delightful companion, and he would have made an excellent and yet
safe President. I found him truly conservative, and strong for peace
upon all international questions.

[Illustration: SKIBO CASTLE]




CHAPTER XXVIII

HAY AND McKINLEY


John Hay was our frequent guest in England and Scotland, and was on
the eve of coming to us at Skibo in 1898 when called home by President
McKinley to become Secretary of State. Few have made such a record in
that office. He inspired men with absolute confidence in his
sincerity, and his aspirations were always high. War he detested, and
meant what he said when he pronounced it "the most ferocious and yet
the most futile folly of man."

The Philippines annexation was a burning question when I met him and
Henry White (Secretary of Legation and later Ambassador to France) in
London, on my way to New York. It gratified me to find our views were
similar upon that proposed serious departure from our traditional
policy of avoiding distant and disconnected possessions and keeping
our empire within the continent, especially keeping it out of the
vortex of militarism. Hay, White, and I clasped hands together in
Hay's office in London, and agreed upon this. Before that he had
written me the following note:

     _London, August 22, 1898_

     MY DEAR CARNEGIE:

     I thank you for the Skibo grouse and also for your kind
     letter. It is a solemn and absorbing thing to hear so many
     kind and unmerited words as I have heard and read this last
     week. It seems to me another man they are talking about,
     while I am expected to do the work. I wish a little of the
     kindness could be saved till I leave office finally.

     I have read with the keenest interest your article in the
     "North American."[77] I am not allowed to say in my present
     fix how much I agree with you. The only question on my mind
     is how far it is now _possible_ for us to withdraw from the
     Philippines. I am rather thankful it is not given to me to
     solve that momentous question.[78]

[Footnote 77: The reference is to an article by Mr. Carnegie in the
_North American Review_, August, 1898, entitled: "Distant
Possessions--The Parting of the Ways."]

[Footnote 78: Published in Thayer, _Life and Letters of John Hay_,
vol. II, p. 175. Boston and New York, 1915.]

It was a strange fate that placed upon him the very task he had
congratulated himself was never to be his.

He stood alone at first as friendly to China in the Boxer troubles and
succeeded in securing for her fair terms of peace. His regard for
Britain, as part of our own race, was deep, and here the President was
thoroughly with him, and grateful beyond measure to Britain for
standing against other European powers disposed to favor Spain in the
Cuban War.

The Hay-Pauncefote Treaty concerning the Panama Canal seemed to many
of us unsatisfactory. Senator Elkins told me my objections, given in
the "New York Tribune," reached him the day he was to speak upon it,
and were useful. Visiting Washington soon after the article appeared,
I went with Senator Hanna to the White House early in the morning and
found the President much exercised over the Senate's amendment to the
treaty. I had no doubt of Britain's prompt acquiescence in the
Senate's requirements, and said so. Anything in reason she would give,
since it was we who had to furnish the funds for the work from which
she would be, next to ourselves, the greatest gainer.

Senator Hanna asked if I had seen "John," as he and President McKinley
always called Mr. Hay. I said I had not. Then he asked me to go over
and cheer him up, for he was disconsolate about the amendments. I did
so. I pointed out to Mr. Hay that the Clayton-Bulwer Treaty had been
amended by the Senate and scarcely any one knew this now and no one
cared. The Hay-Pauncefote Treaty would be executed as amended and no
one would care a fig whether it was in its original form or not. He
doubted this and thought Britain would be indisposed to recede. A
short time after this, dining with him, he said I had proved a true
prophet and all was well.

Of course it was. Britain had practically told us she wished the canal
built and would act in any way desired. The canal is now as it should
be--that is, all American, with no international complications
possible. It was perhaps not worth building at that time, but it was
better to spend three or four hundred millions upon it than in
building sea monsters of destruction to fight imaginary foes. One may
be a loss and there an end; the other might be a source of war, for

    "Oft the sight of means to do ill deeds
    Make deeds ill done."

Mr. Hay's _bête noire_ was the Senate. Upon this, and this only, was
he disregardful of the proprieties. When it presumed to alter one
word, substituting "treaty" for "agreement," which occurred in one
place only in the proposed Arbitration Treaty of 1905, he became
unduly excited. I believe this was owing in great degree to poor
health, for it was clear by that time to intimate friends that his
health was seriously impaired.

The last time I saw him was at lunch at his house, when the
Arbitration Treaty, as amended by the Senate, was under the
consideration of President Roosevelt. The arbitrationists, headed by
ex-Secretary of State Foster, urged the President's acceptance of the
amended treaty. We thought he was favorable to this, but from my
subsequent talk with Secretary Hay, I saw that the President's
agreeing would be keenly felt. I should not be surprised if
Roosevelt's rejection of the treaty was resolved upon chiefly to
soothe his dear friend John Hay in his illness. I am sure I felt that
I could be brought to do, only with the greatest difficulty, anything
that would annoy that noble soul. But upon this point Hay was
obdurate; no surrender to the Senate. Leaving his house I said to Mrs.
Carnegie that I doubted if ever we should meet our friend again. We
never did.

The Carnegie Institution of Washington, of which Hay was the chairman
and a trustee from the start, received his endorsement and close
attention, and much were we indebted to him for wise counsel. As a
statesman he made his reputation in shorter time and with a surer
touch than any one I know of. And it may be doubted if any public man
ever had more deeply attached friends. One of his notes I have long
kept. It would have been the most flattering of any to my literary
vanity but for my knowledge of his most lovable nature and undue
warmth for his friends. The world is poorer to me to-day as I write,
since he has left it.

The Spanish War was the result of a wave of passion started by the
reports of the horrors of the Cuban Revolution. President McKinley
tried hard to avoid it. When the Spanish Minister left Washington, the
French Ambassador became Spain's agent, and peaceful negotiations were
continued. Spain offered autonomy for Cuba. The President replied that
he did not know exactly what "autonomy" meant. What he wished for Cuba
was the rights that Canada possessed. He understood these. A cable was
shown to the President by the French Minister stating that Spain
granted this and he, dear man, supposed all was settled. So it was,
apparently.

Speaker Reed usually came to see me Sunday mornings when in New York,
and it was immediately after my return from Europe that year that he
called and said he had never lost control of the House before. For one
moment he thought of leaving the chair and going on the floor to
address the House and try to quiet it. In vain it was explained that
the President had received from Spain the guarantee of self-government
for Cuba. Alas! it was too late, too late!

"What is Spain doing over here, anyhow?" was the imperious inquiry of
Congress. A sufficient number of Republicans had agreed to vote with
the Democrats in Congress for war. A whirlwind of passion swept over
the House, intensified, no doubt, by the unfortunate explosion of the
warship Maine in Havana Harbor, supposed by some to be Spanish work.
The supposition gave Spain far too much credit for skill and activity.

War was declared--the Senate being shocked by Senator Proctor's
statement of the concentration camps he had seen in Cuba. The country
responded to the cry, "What is Spain doing over here anyhow?"
President McKinley and his peace policy were left high and dry, and
nothing remained for him but to go with the country. The Government
then announced that war was not undertaken for territorial
aggrandizement, and Cuba was promised independence--a promise
faithfully kept. We should not fail to remember this, for it is the
one cheering feature of the war.

The possession of the Philippines left a stain. They were not only
territorial acquisition; they were dragged from reluctant Spain and
twenty million dollars paid for them. The Filipinos had been our
allies in fighting Spain. The Cabinet, under the lead of the
President, had agreed that only a coaling station in the Philippines
should be asked for, and it is said such were the instructions given
by cable at first to the Peace Commissioners at Paris. President
McKinley then made a tour through the West and, of course, was cheered
when he spoke of the flag and Dewey's victory. He returned, impressed
with the idea that withdrawal would be unpopular, and reversed his
former policy. I was told by one of his Cabinet that every member was
opposed to the reversal. A senator told me Judge Day, one of the Peace
Commissioners, wrote a remonstrance from Paris, which if ever
published, would rank next to Washington's Farewell Address, so fine
was it.

At this stage an important member of the Cabinet, my friend Cornelius
N. Bliss, called and asked me to visit Washington and see the
President on the subject. He said:

"You have influence with him. None of us have been able to move him
since he returned from the West."

I went to Washington and had an interview with him. But he was
obdurate. Withdrawal would create a revolution at home, he said.
Finally, by persuading his secretaries that he had to bend to the
blast, and always holding that it would be only a temporary occupation
and that a way out would be found, the Cabinet yielded.

He sent for President Schurman, of Cornell University, who had opposed
annexation and made him chairman of the committee to visit the
Filipinos; and later for Judge Taft, who had been prominent against
such a violation of American policy, to go as Governor. When the Judge
stated that it seemed strange to send for one, who had publicly
denounced annexation, the President said that was the very reason why
he wished him for the place. This was all very well, but to refrain
from annexing and to relinquish territory once purchased are different
propositions. This was soon seen.

Mr. Bryan had it in his power at one time to defeat in the Senate this
feature of the Treaty of Peace with Spain. I went to Washington to try
to effect this, and remained there until the vote was taken. I was
told that when Mr. Bryan was in Washington he had advised his friends
that it would be good party policy to allow the treaty to pass. This
would discredit the Republican Party before the people; that "paying
twenty millions for a revolution" would defeat any party. There were
seven staunch Bryan men anxious to vote against Philippine annexation.

Mr. Bryan had called to see me in New York upon the subject, because
my opposition to the purchase had been so pronounced, and I now wired
him at Omaha explaining the situation and begging him to wire me that
his friends could use their own judgment. His reply was what I have
stated--better have the Republicans pass it and let it then go before
the people. I thought it unworthy of him to subordinate such an issue,
fraught with deplorable consequences, to mere party politics. It
required the casting vote of the Speaker to carry the measure. One
word from Mr. Bryan would have saved the country from the disaster. I
could not be cordial to him for years afterwards. He had seemed to me
a man who was willing to sacrifice his country and his personal
convictions for party advantage.

When I called upon President McKinley immediately after the vote, I
condoled with him upon being dependent for support upon his leading
opponent. I explained just how his victory had been won and suggested
that he should send his grateful acknowledgments to Mr. Bryan. A
Colonial possession thousands of miles away was a novel problem to
President McKinley, and indeed to all American statesmen. Nothing did
they know of the troubles and dangers it would involve. Here the
Republic made its first grievous international mistake--a mistake
which dragged it into the vortex of international militarism and a
great navy. What a change has come over statesmen since!

At supper with President Roosevelt at the White House a few weeks ago
(1907), he said:

"If you wish to see the two men in the United States who are the most
anxious to get out of the Philippines, here they are," pointing to
Secretary Taft and himself.

"Then why don't you?" I responded. "The American people would be glad
indeed."

But both the President and Judge Taft believed our duty required us to
prepare the Islands for self-government first. This is the policy of
"Don't go into the water until you learn to swim." But the plunge has
to be and will be taken some day.

It was urged that if we did not occupy the Philippines, Germany would.
It never occurred to the urgers that this would mean Britain agreeing
that Germany should establish a naval base at Macao, a short sail from
Britain's naval base in the East. Britain would as soon permit her to
establish a base at Kingston, Ireland, eighty miles from Liverpool. I
was surprised to hear men--men like Judge Taft, although he was
opposed at first to the annexation--give this reason when we were
discussing the question after the fatal step had been taken. But we
know little of foreign relations. We have hitherto been a consolidated
country. It will be a sad day if we ever become anything otherwise.




CHAPTER XXIX

MEETING THE GERMAN EMPEROR


My first Rectorial Address to the students of St. Andrews University
attracted the attention of the German Emperor, who sent word to me in
New York by Herr Ballin that he had read every word of it. He also
sent me by him a copy of his address upon his eldest son's
consecration. Invitations to meet him followed; but it was not until
June, 1907, that I could leave, owing to other engagements. Mrs.
Carnegie and I went to Kiel. Mr. Tower, our American Ambassador to
Germany, and Mrs. Tower met us there and were very kind in their
attentions. Through them we met many of the distinguished public men
during our three days' stay there.

The first morning, Mr. Tower took me to register on the Emperor's
yacht. I had no expectation of seeing the Emperor, but he happened to
come on deck, and seeing Mr. Tower he asked what had brought him on
the yacht so early. Mr. Tower explained he had brought me over to
register, and that Mr. Carnegie was on board. He asked:

"Why not present him now? I wish to see him."

I was talking to the admirals who were assembling for a conference,
and did not see Mr. Tower and the Emperor approaching from behind. A
touch on my shoulder and I turned around.

"Mr. Carnegie, the Emperor."

It was a moment before I realized that the Emperor was before me. I
raised both hands, and exclaimed:

"This has happened just as I could have wished, with no ceremony, and
the Man of Destiny dropped from the clouds."

Then I continued: "Your Majesty, I have traveled two nights to accept
your generous invitation, and never did so before to meet a crowned
head."

Then the Emperor, smiling--and such a captivating smile:

"Oh! yes, yes, I have read your books. You do not like kings."

"No, Your Majesty, I do not like kings, but I do like a man behind a
king when I find him."

"Ah! there is one king you like, I know, a Scottish king, Robert the
Bruce. He was my hero in my youth. I was brought up on him."

"Yes, Your Majesty, so was I, and he lies buried in Dunfermline Abbey,
in my native town. When a boy, I used to walk often around the
towering square monument on the Abbey--one word on each block in big
stone letters 'King Robert the Bruce'--with all the fervor of a
Catholic counting his beads. But Bruce was much more than a king, Your
Majesty, he was the leader of his people. And not the first; Wallace
the man of the people comes first. Your Majesty, I now own King
Malcolm's tower in Dunfermline[79]--he from whom you derive your
precious heritage of Scottish blood. Perhaps you know the fine old
ballad, 'Sir Patrick Spens.'

[Footnote 79: In the deed of trust conveying Pittencrieff Park and
Glen to Dunfermline an unspecified reservation of property was made.
The "with certain exceptions" related to King Malcolm's Tower. For
reasons best known to himself Mr. Carnegie retained the ownership of
this relic of the past.]

    "'The King sits in Dunfermline tower
    Drinking the bluid red wine.'

I should like to escort you some day to the tower of your Scottish
ancestor, that you may do homage to his memory." He exclaimed:

"That would be very fine. The Scotch are much quicker and cleverer
than the Germans. The Germans are too slow."

"Your Majesty, where anything Scotch is concerned, I must decline to
accept you as an impartial judge."

He laughed and waved adieu, calling out:

"You are to dine with me this evening"--and excusing himself went to
greet the arriving admirals.

About sixty were present at the dinner and we had a pleasant time,
indeed. His Majesty, opposite whom I sat, was good enough to raise his
glass and invite me to drink with him. After he had done so with Mr.
Tower, our Ambassador, who sat at his right, he asked across the
table--heard by those near--whether I had told Prince von Bülow, next
whom I sat, that his (the Emperor's) hero, Bruce, rested in my native
town of Dunfermline, and his ancestor's tower in Pittencrieff Glen,
was in my possession.

"No," I replied; "with Your Majesty I am led into such frivolities,
but my intercourse with your Lord High Chancellor, I assure you, will
always be of a serious import."

We dined with Mrs. Goelet upon her yacht, one evening, and His Majesty
being present, I told him President Roosevelt had said recently to me
that he wished custom permitted him to leave the country so he could
run over and see him (the Emperor). He thought a substantial talk
would result in something good being accomplished. I believed that
also. The Emperor agreed and said he wished greatly to see him and
hoped he would some day come to Germany. I suggested that he (the
Emperor) was free from constitutional barriers and could sail over
and see the President.

"Ah, but my country needs me here! How can I leave?"

I replied:

"Before leaving home one year, when I went to our mills to bid the
officials good-bye and expressed regret at leaving them all hard at
work, sweltering in the hot sun, but that I found I had now every year
to rest and yet no matter how tired I might be one half-hour on the
bow of the steamer, cutting the Atlantic waves, gave me perfect
relief, my clever manager, Captain Jones, retorted: 'And, oh, Lord!
think of the relief we all get.' It might be the same with your
people, Your Majesty."

He laughed heartily over and over again. It opened a new train of
thought. He repeated his desire to meet President Roosevelt, and I
said:

"Well, Your Majesty, when you two do get together, I think I shall
have to be with you. You and he, I fear, might get into mischief."

He laughed and said:

"Oh, I see! You wish to drive us together. Well, I agree if you make
Roosevelt first horse, I shall follow."

"Ah, no, Your Majesty, I know horse-flesh better than to attempt to
drive two such gay colts tandem. You never get proper purchase on the
first horse. I must yoke you both in the shafts, neck and neck, so I
can hold you in."

I never met a man who enjoyed stories more keenly than the Emperor. He
is fine company, and I believe an earnest man, anxious for the peace
and progress of the world. Suffice it to say he insists that he is,
and always has been, for peace. [1907.] He cherishes the fact that he
has reigned for twenty-four years and has never shed human blood. He
considers that the German navy is too small to affect the British and
was never intended to be a rival. Nevertheless, it is in my opinion
very unwise, because unnecessary, to enlarge it. Prince von Bülow
holds these sentiments and I believe the peace of the world has little
to fear from Germany. Her interests are all favorable to peace,
industrial development being her aim; and in this desirable field she
is certainly making great strides.

I sent the Emperor by his Ambassador, Baron von Sternberg, the book,
"The Roosevelt Policy,"[80] to which I had written an introduction
that pleased the President, and I rejoice in having received from him
a fine bronze of himself with a valued letter. He is not only an
Emperor, but something much higher--a man anxious to improve existing
conditions, untiring in his efforts to promote temperance, prevent
dueling, and, I believe, to secure International Peace.

[Footnote 80: _The Roosevelt Policy: Speeches, Letters and State
Papers relating to Corporate Wealth and closely Allied Topics._ New
York, 1908.]

I have for some time been haunted with the feeling that the Emperor
was indeed a Man of Destiny. My interviews with him have strengthened
that feeling. I have great hopes of him in the future doing something
really great and good. He may yet have a part to play that will give
him a place among the immortals. He has ruled Germany in peace for
twenty-seven years, but something beyond even this record is due from
one who has the power to establish peace among civilized nations
through positive action. Maintaining peace in his own land is not
sufficient from one whose invitation to other leading civilized
nations to combine and establish arbitration of all international
disputes would be gladly responded to. Whether he is to pass into
history as only the preserver of internal peace at home or is to
rise to his appointed mission as the Apostle of Peace among leading
civilized nations, the future has still to reveal.

The year before last (1912) I stood before him in the grand palace in
Berlin and presented the American address of congratulation upon his
peaceful reign of twenty-five years, his hand unstained by human
blood. As I approached to hand to him the casket containing the
address, he recognized me and with outstretched arms, exclaimed:

"Carnegie, twenty-five years of peace, and we hope for many more."

I could not help responding:

"And in this noblest of all missions you are our chief ally."

He had hitherto sat silent and motionless, taking the successive
addresses from one officer and handing them to another to be placed
upon the table. The chief subject under discussion had been World
Peace, which he could have, and in my opinion, would have secured, had
he not been surrounded by the military caste which inevitably gathers
about one born to the throne--a caste which usually becomes as
permanent as the potentate himself, and which has so far in Germany
proved its power of control whenever the war issue has been presented.
Until militarism is subordinated, there can be no World Peace.

       *       *       *       *       *

As I read this to-day [1914], what a change! The world convulsed by
war as never before! Men slaying each other like wild beasts! I dare
not relinquish all hope. In recent days I see another ruler coming
forward upon the world stage, who may prove himself the immortal one.
The man who vindicated his country's honor in the Panama Canal toll
dispute is now President. He has the indomitable will of genius, and
true hope which we are told,

    "Kings it makes gods, and meaner creatures kings."

Nothing is impossible to genius! Watch President Wilson! He has Scotch
blood in his veins.

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project

distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at
http://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent
permitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.
Fairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered
throughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at
809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email
business@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact

     Dr. Gregory B. Newby
     Chief Executive and Director
     gbnewby@pglaf.org

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

Dedicated
TO THE MEMORY OF MY UNCLE
SAMUEL EDWIN MERWIN
WHOSE TIMELY GENEROSITY I BELIEVE SAVED MY LIFE
AND WHOSE DEATH HAS FOREVER ROBBED
ME OF A SATISFYING OPPORTUNITY
TO PROVE MY GRATITUDE




A Mind That Found Itself

I


This story is derived from as human a document as ever existed; and,
because of its uncommon nature, perhaps no one thing contributes so
much to its value as its authenticity. It is an autobiography, and
more: in part it is a biography; for, in telling the story of my life,
I must relate the history of another self--a self which was dominant
from my twenty-fourth to my twenty-sixth year. During that period I was
unlike what I had been, or what I have been since. The biographical
part of my autobiography might be called the history of a mental civil
war, which I fought single-handed on a battlefield that lay within the
compass of my skull. An Army of Unreason, composed of the cunning and
treacherous thoughts of an unfair foe, attacked my bewildered
consciousness with cruel persistency, and would have destroyed me, had
not a triumphant Reason finally interposed a superior strategy that
saved me from my unnatural self.

I am not telling the story of my life just to write a book. I tell it
because it seems my plain duty to do so. A narrow escape from death and
a seemingly miraculous return to health after an apparently fatal
illness are enough to make a man ask himself: For what purpose was my
life spared? That question I have asked myself, and this book is, in
part, an answer.

I was born shortly after sunset about thirty years ago. My ancestors,
natives of England, settled in this country not long after the
_Mayflower_ first sailed into Plymouth Harbor. And the blood of these
ancestors, by time and the happy union of a Northern man and a Southern
woman--my parents--has perforce been blended into blood truly American.

The first years of my life were, in most ways, not unlike those of
other American boys, except as a tendency to worry made them so. Though
the fact is now difficult for me to believe, I was painfully shy. When
first I put on short trousers, I felt that the eyes of the world were
on me; and to escape them I hid behind convenient pieces of furniture
while in the house and, so I am told, even sidled close to fences when
I walked along the street. With my shyness there was a degree of
self-consciousness which put me at a disadvantage in any family or
social gathering. I talked little and was ill at ease when others spoke
to me.

Like many other sensitive and somewhat introspective children, I passed
through a brief period of morbid righteousness. In a game of
"one-old-cat," the side on which I played was defeated. On a piece of
scantling which lay in the lot where the contest took place, I
scratched the score. Afterwards it occurred to me that my inscription
was perhaps misleading and would make my side appear to be the winner.
I went back and corrected the ambiguity. On finding in an old tool
chest at home a coin or medal, on which there appeared the text, "Put
away the works of darkness and put on the armour of light," my sense of
religious propriety was offended. It seemed a sacrilege to use in this
way such a high sentiment, so I destroyed the coin.

I early took upon myself, mentally at least, many of the cares and
worries of those about me. Whether in this I was different from other
youngsters who develop a ludicrous, though pathetic, sense of
responsibility for the universe, I do not know. But in my case the most
extreme instance occurred during a business depression, when the family
resources were endangered. I began to fear that my father (than whom a
more hopeful man never lived) might commit suicide.

After all, I am not sure that the other side of my nature--the natural,
healthy, boyish side--did not develop equally with these timid and
morbid tendencies, which are not so very uncommon in childhood.
Certainly the natural, boyish side was more in evidence on the surface.
I was as good a sport as any of my playfellows in such games as
appealed to me, and I went a-fishing when the chance offered. None of
my associates thought of me as being shy or morose. But this was
because I masked my troubles, though quite unconsciously, under a
camouflage of sarcasm and sallies of wit, or, at least, what seemed to
pass for wit among my immature acquaintances. With grown-ups, I was at
times inclined to be pert, my degree of impudence depending no doubt
upon how ill at ease I was and how perfectly at ease I wished to
appear. Because of the constant need for appearing happier than I
really was, I developed a knack for saying things in an amusing,
sometimes an epigrammatic, way. I recall one remark made long before I
could possibly have heard of Malthus or have understood his theory
regarding birth rate and food supply. Ours being a large family of
limited means and, among the five boys of the family, unlimited
appetites, we often used the cheaper, though equally nutritious, cuts
of meat. On one occasion when the steak was tougher than usual, I
epitomized the Malthusian theory by remarking: "I believe in fewer
children and better beefsteak!"

One more incident of my boyhood days may assist the reader to make my
acquaintance. In my early teens I was, for one year, a member of a boy
choir. Barring my voice, I was a good chorister, and, like all good
choir-boys, I was distinguished by that seraphic passiveness from which
a reaction of some kind is to be expected immediately after a service
or rehearsal. On one occasion this reaction in me manifested itself in
a fist fight with a fellow choir-boy. Though I cannot recall the time
when I have not relished verbal encounters, physical encounters had
never been to my taste, and I did not seek this fight. My assailant
really goaded me into it. If the honors were not mine, at least I must
have acquitted myself creditably, for an interested passer-by made a
remark which I have never forgotten. "That boy is all right after he
gets started," he said. About twelve years later I did get started, and
could that passer-by have seen me on any one of several occasions, he
would have had the satisfaction of knowing that his was a prophetic
eye.

At the usual age, I entered a public grammar school in New Haven,
Connecticut, where I graduated in 1891. In the fall of that year I
entered the High School of the same city. My school courses were
completed with as little trouble as scholastic distinction. I always
managed to gain promotion, however, when it was due; and, though few of
my teachers credited me with real ability, they were always able to
detect a certain latent capacity, which they evidently believed would
one day develop sufficiently to prevent me from disgracing them.

Upon entering the High School I had such ambitions as any schoolboy is
apt to have. I wished to secure an election to a given secret society;
that gained, I wished to become business manager of a monthly magazine
published by that society. In these ambitions I succeeded. For one of
my age I had more than an average love of business. Indeed, I
deliberately set about learning to play the guitar well enough to
become eligible for membership in the Banjo Club--and this for no more
aesthetic purpose than to place myself in line for the position of
manager, to which I was later elected.

In athletics there was but one game, tennis, in which I was actively
interested. Its quick give-and-take suited my temperament, and so fond
was I of it that during one summer I played not fewer than four
thousand games. As I had an aptitude for tennis and devoted more time
to it than did any of my schoolmates, it was not surprising that I
acquired skill enough to win the school championship during my senior
year. But that success was not due entirely to my superiority as a
player. It was due in part to what I considered unfair treatment; and
the fact well illustrates a certain trait of character which has often
stood me in good stead. Among the spectators at the final match of the
tournament were several girls. These schoolmates, who lived in my
neighborhood, had mistaken for snobbishness a certain boyish diffidence
for which few people gave me credit. When we passed each other, almost
daily, this group of girls and I, our mutual sign of recognition was a
look in an opposite direction. Now my opponent was well liked by these
same girls and was entitled to their support. Accordingly they
applauded his good plays, which was fair. They did not applaud my good
plays, which was also fair. But what was not fair was that they should
applaud my bad plays. Their doing so roiled my blood, and thanks to
those who would have had me lose, I won.

In June, 1894, I received a high school diploma. Shortly afterwards I
took my examinations for Yale, and the following September entered the
Sheffield Scientific School, in a non-technical course.

The last week of June, 1894, was an important one in my life. An event
then occurred which undoubtedly changed my career completely. It was
the direct cause of my mental collapse six years later, and of the
distressing and, in some instances, strange and delightful experiences
on which this book is based. The event was the illness of an older
brother, who, late in June, 1894, was stricken with what was thought to
be epilepsy. Few diseases can so disorganize a household and distress
its members. My brother had enjoyed perfect health up to the time he
was stricken; and, as there had never been a suggestion of epilepsy, or
any like disease, in either branch of the family, the affliction came
as a bolt from a clear sky. Everything possible was done to effect a
cure, but without avail. On July 4th, 1900, he died, after a six years'
illness, two years of which were spent at home, one year in a trip
around the world in a sailing vessel, and most of the remainder on a
farm near Hartford. The doctors finally decided that a tumor at the
base of the brain had caused his malady and his death.

As I was in college when my brother was first stricken, I had more time
at my disposal than the other members of the family, and for that
reason spent much of it with him. Though his attacks during the first
year occurred only at night, the fear that they might occur during the
day, in public, affected my nerves from the beginning.

Now, if a brother who had enjoyed perfect health all his life could be
stricken with epilepsy, what was to prevent my being similarly
afflicted? This was the thought that soon got possession of my mind.
The more I considered it and him, the more nervous I became; and the
more nervous, the more convinced that my own breakdown was only a
matter of time. Doomed to what I then considered a living death, I
thought of epilepsy, I dreamed epilepsy, until thousands of times
during the six years that this disquieting idea persisted, my
over-wrought imagination seemed to drag me to the very verge of an
attack. Yet at no time during my life have these early fears been
realized.

For the fourteen months succeeding the time my brother was first
stricken, I was greatly harassed with fear; but not until later did my
nerves really conquer me. I remember distinctly when the break came. It
happened in November, 1895, during a recitation in German. That hour in
the class room was one of the most disagreeable I ever experienced. It
seemed as if my nerves had snapped, like so many minute bands of rubber
stretched beyond their elastic limit. Had I had the courage to leave
the room, I should have done so; but I sat as if paralyzed until the
class was dismissed.

That term I did not again attend recitations. Continuing my studies at
home, I passed satisfactory examinations, which enabled me to resume my
place in the class room the following January. During the remainder of
my college years I seldom entered a recitation room with any other
feeling than that of dread, though the absolute assurance that I should
not be called upon to recite did somewhat relieve my anxiety in some
classes. The professors, whom I had told about my state of health and
the cause of it, invariably treated me with consideration; but, though
I believe they never doubted the genuineness of my excuse, it was easy
matter to keep them convinced for almost two-thirds of my college
course. My inability to recite was not due usually to any lack of
preparation. However well prepared I might be, the moment I was called
upon, a mingling of a thousand disconcerting sensations, and the
distinct thought that at last the dread attack was at hand, would
suddenly intervene and deprive me of all but the power to say, "Not
prepared." Weeks would pass without any other record being placed
opposite my name than a zero, or a blank indicating that I had not been
called upon at all. Occasionally, however, a professor, in justice to
himself and to the other students, would insist that I recite, and at
such times I managed to make enough of a recitation to hold my place in
the class.

When I entered Yale, I had four definite ambitions: first, to secure an
election to a coveted secret society; second, to become one of the
editors of the _Yale Record_, an illustrated humorous bi-weekly; third
(granting that I should succeed in this latter ambition), to convince
my associates that I should have the position of business manager--an
office which I sought, not for the honor, but because I believed it
would enable me to earn an amount of money at least equal to the cost
of tuition for my years at Yale; fourth (and this was my chief
ambition), to win my diploma within the prescribed time. These four
ambitions I fortunately achieved.

A man's college days, collectively, are usually his happiest. Most of
mine were not happy. Yet I look back upon them with great satisfaction,
for I feel that I was fortunate enough to absorb some of that
intangible, but very real, element known as the "Yale spirit." This has
helped to keep Hope alive within me during my most discouraged moments,
and has ever since made the accomplishment of my purposes seem easy and
sure.




II


On the thirtieth day of June, 1897, I graduated at Yale. Had I then
realized that I was a sick man, I could and would have taken a rest.
But, in a way, I had become accustomed to the ups and downs of a
nervous existence, and, as I could not really afford a rest, six days
after my graduation I entered upon the duties of a clerk in the office
of the Collector of Taxes in the city of New Haven. I was fortunate in
securing such a position at that time, for the hours were comparatively
short and the work as congenial as any could have been under the
circumstances. I entered the Tax Office with the intention of staying
only until such time as I might secure a position in New York. About a
year later I secured the desired position. After remaining in it for
eight months I left it, in order to take a position which seemed to
offer a field of endeavor more to my taste. From May, 1899, till the
middle of June, 1900, I was a clerk in one of the smaller
life-insurance companies, whose home office was within a stone's throw
of what some men consider the center of the universe. To be in the very
heart of the financial district of New York appealed strongly to my
imagination. As a result of the contagious ideals of Wall Street, the
making of money was then a passion with me. I wished to taste the
bitter-sweet of power based on wealth.

For the first eighteen months of my life in New York my health seemed
no worse than it had been during the preceding three years. But the old
dread still possessed me. I continued to have my more and less nervous
days, weeks, and months. In March, 1900, however, there came a change
for the worse. At that time I had a severe attack of grippe which
incapacitated me for two weeks. As was to be expected in my case, this
illness seriously depleted my vitality, and left me in a frightfully
depressed condition--a depression which continued to grow upon me until
the final crash came, on June 23rd, 1900. The events of that day,
seemingly disastrous as then viewed, but evidently all for the best as
the issue proved, forced me along paths traveled by thousands, but
comprehended by few.

I had continued to perform my clerical duties until June 15th. On that
day I was compelled to stop, and that at once. I had reached a point
where my will had to capitulate to Unreason--that unscrupulous usurper.
My previous five years as a neurasthenic had led me to believe that I
had experienced all the disagreeable sensations an overworked and
unstrung nervous system could suffer. But on this day several new and
terrifying sensations seized me and rendered me all but helpless. My
condition, however, was not apparent even to those who worked with me
at the same desk. I remember trying to speak and at times finding
myself unable to give utterance to my thoughts. Though I was able to
answer questions, that fact hardly diminished my feeling of
apprehension, for a single failure in an attempt to speak will stagger
any man, no matter what his state of health. I tried to copy certain
records in the day's work, but my hand was too unsteady, and I found it
difficult to read the words and figures presented to my tired vision in
blurred confusion.

That afternoon, conscious that some terrible calamity was impending,
but not knowing what would be its nature, I performed a very curious
act. Certain early literary efforts which had failed of publication in
the college paper, but which I had jealously cherished for several
years, I utterly destroyed. Then, after a hurried arrangement of my
affairs, I took an early afternoon train, and was soon in New Haven.
Home life did not make me better, and, except for three or four short
walks, I did not go out of the house at all until June 23d, when I went
in a most unusual way. To relatives I said little about my state of
health, beyond the general statement that I had never felt worse--a
statement which, when made by a neurasthenic, means much, but proves
little. For five years I had had my ups and downs, and both my
relatives and myself had begun to look upon these as things which would
probably be corrected in and by time.

The day after my home-coming I made up my mind, or that part of it
which was still within my control, that the time had come to quit
business entirely and take a rest of months. I even arranged with a
younger brother to set out at once for some quiet place in the White
Mountains, where I hoped to steady my shattered nerves. At this time I
felt as though in a tremor from head to foot, and the thought that I
was about to have an epileptic attack constantly recurred. On more than
one occasion I said to friends that I would rather die than live an
epileptic; yet, if I rightly remember, I never declared the actual fear
that I was doomed to bear such an affliction. Though I held the mad
belief that I should suffer epilepsy, I held the sane hope, amounting
to belief, that I should escape it. This fact may account, in a
measure, for my six years of endurance.

On the 18th of June I felt so much worse that I went to my bed and
stayed there until the 23d. During the night of the 18th my persistent
dread became a false belief--a delusion. What I had long expected I now
became convinced had at last occurred. I believed myself to be a
confirmed epileptic, and that conviction was stronger than any ever
held by a sound intellect. The half-resolve, made before my mind was
actually impaired, namely, that I would kill myself rather than live
the life I dreaded, now divided my attention with the belief that the
stroke had fallen. From that time my one thought was to hasten the end,
for I felt that I should lose the chance to die should relatives find
me in an attack of epilepsy.

Considering the state of my mind and my inability at that time to
appreciate the enormity of such an end as I half contemplated, my
suicidal purpose was not entirely selfish. That I had never seriously
contemplated suicide is proved by the fact that I had not provided
myself with the means of accomplishing it, despite my habit, has long
been remarked by my friends, of preparing even for unlikely
contingencies. So far as I had the control of my faculties, it must be
admitted that I deliberated; but, strictly speaking, the rash act which
followed cannot correctly be called an attempt at suicide--for how can
a man who is not himself kill himself?

Soon my disordered brain was busy with schemes for death. I distinctly
remember one which included a row on Lake Whitney, near New Haven. This
I intended to take in the most unstable boat obtainable. Such a craft
could be easily upset, and I should so bequeath to relatives and
friends a sufficient number of reasonable doubts to rob my death of the
usual stigma. I also remember searching for some deadly drug which I
hoped to find about the house. But the quantity and quality of what I
found were not such as I dared to trust. I then thought of severing my
jugular vein, even going so far as to test against my throat the edge
of a razor which, after the deadly impulse first asserted itself, I had
secreted in a convenient place. I really wished to die, but so
uncertain and ghastly a method did not appeal to me. Nevertheless, had
I felt sure that in my tremulous frenzy I could accomplish the act with
skilful dispatch, I should at once have ended my troubles.

My imaginary attacks were now recurring with distracting frequency, and
I was in constant fear of discovery. During these three or four days I
slept scarcely at all--even the medicine given to induce sleep having
little effect. Though inwardly frenzied, I gave no outward sign of my
condition. Most of the time I remained quietly in bed. I spoke but
seldom. I had practically, though not entirely, lost the power of
speech; but my almost unbroken silence aroused no suspicions as to the
seriousness of my condition.

By a process of elimination, all suicidal methods but one had at last
been put aside. On that one my mind now centred. My room was on the
fourth floor of the house--one of a block of five--in which my parents
lived. The house stood several feet back from the street. The sills of
my windows were a little more than thirty feet above the ground. Under
one was a flag pavement, extending from the house to the front gate.
Under the other was a rectangular coal-hole covered with an iron
grating. This was surrounded by flagging over a foot in width; and
connecting it and the pavement proper was another flag. So that all
along the front of the house, stone or iron filled a space at no point
less than two feet in width. It required little calculation to
determine how slight the chance of surviving a fall from either of
those windows.

About dawn I arose. Stealthily I approached a window, pushed open the
blinds, and looked out--and down. Then I closed the blinds as
noiselessly as possible and crept back to bed: I had not yet become so
irresponsible that I dared to take the leap. Scarcely had I pulled up
the covering when a watchful relative entered my room, drawn thither
perhaps by that protecting prescience which love inspires. I thought
her words revealed a suspicion that she had heard me at the window, but
speechless as I was I had enough speech to deceive her. For of what
account are Truth and Love when Life itself has ceased to seem
desirable?

The dawn soon hid itself in the brilliancy of a perfect June day. Never
had I seen a brighter--to look at; never a darker--to live through--or
a better to die upon. Its very perfection and the songs of the robins,
which at that season were plentiful in the neighborhood, served but to
increase my despair and make me the more willing to die. As the day
wore on, my anguish became more intense, but I managed to mislead those
about me by uttering a word now and then, and feigning to read a
newspaper, which to me, however, appeared an unintelligible jumble of
type. My brain was in a ferment. It felt as if pricked by a million
needles at white heat. My whole body felt as though it would be torn
apart by the terrific nervous strain under which I labored.

Shortly after noon, dinner having been served, my mother entered the
room and asked me if she should bring me some dessert. I assented. It
was not that I cared for the dessert; I had no appetite. I wished to
get her out of the room, for I believed myself to be on the verge of
another attack. She left at once. I knew that in two or three minutes
she would return. The crisis seemed at hand. It was now or never for
liberation. She had probably descended one of three flights of stairs
when, with the mad desire to dash my brains out on the pavement below,
I rushed to that window which was directly over the flag walk.
Providence must have guided my movements, for in some otherwise
unaccountable way, on the very point of hurling myself out bodily, I
chose to drop feet foremost instead. With my fingers I clung for a
moment to the sill. Then I let go. In falling my body turned so as to
bring my right side toward the building. I struck the ground a little
more than two feet from the foundation of the house, and at least three
to the left of the point from which I started. Missing the stone
pavement by not more than three or four inches, I struck on
comparatively soft earth. My position must have been almost upright,
for both heels struck the ground squarely. The concussion slightly
crushed one heel bone and broke most of the small bones in the arch of
each foot, but there was no mutilation of the flesh. As my feet struck
the ground my right hand struck hard against the front of the house,
and it is probable that these three points of contact, dividing the
force of the shock, prevented my back from being broken. As it was, it
narrowly escaped a fracture and, for several weeks afterward, it felt
as if powdered glass had been substituted for cartilage between the
vertebrae.

I did not lose consciousness even for a second, and the demoniacal
dread, which had possessed me from June, 1894, until this fall to earth
just six years later, was dispelled the instant I struck the ground. At
no time since have I experienced one of my imaginary attacks; nor has
my mind even for a moment entertained such an idea. The little demon
which had tortured me relentlessly for so many years evidently lacked
the stamina which I must have had to survive the shock of my suddenly
arrested flight through space. That the very delusion which drove me to
a death-loving desperation should so suddenly vanish would seem to
indicate that many a suicide might be averted if the person
contemplating it could find the proper assistance when such a crisis
impends.




III


It was squarely in front of the dining-room window that I fell, and
those at dinner were, of course, startled. It took them a second or two
to realize what had happened. Then my younger brother rushed out, and
with others carried me into the house. Naturally that dinner was
permanently interrupted. A mattress was placed on the floor of the
dining room and I on that, suffering intensely. I said little, but what
I said was significant. "I thought I had epilepsy!" was my first
remark; and several times I said, "I wish it was over!" For I believed
that my death was only a question of hours. To the doctors, who soon
arrived, I said, "My back is broken!"--raising myself slightly,
however, as I said so.

An ambulance was summoned and I was placed in it. Because of the nature
of my injuries it had to proceed slowly. The trip of a mile and a half
seemed interminable, but finally I arrived at Grace Hospital and was
placed in a room which soon became a chamber of torture. It was on the
second floor; and the first object to engage my attention and stir my
imagination was a man who appeared outside my window and placed in
position several heavy iron bars. These were, it seems, thought
necessary for my protection, but at that time no such idea occurred to
me. My mind was in a delusional state, ready and eager to seize upon
any external stimulus as a pretext for its wild inventions, and that
barred window started a terrible train of delusions which persisted for
seven hundred and ninety-eight days. During that period my mind
imprisoned both mind and body in a dungeon than which none was ever
more secure.

Knowing that those who attempt suicide are usually placed under arrest,
I believed myself under legal restraint. I imagined that at any moment
I might be taken to court to face some charge lodged against me by the
local police. Every act of those about me seemed to be a part of what,
in police parlance, is commonly called the "Third Degree." The hot
poultices placed upon my feet and ankles threw me into a profuse
perspiration, and my very active association of mad ideas convinced me
that I was being "sweated"--another police term which I had often seen
in the newspapers. I inferred that this third-degree sweating process
was being inflicted in order to extort some kind of a confession,
though what my captors wished me to confess I could not for my life
imagine. As I was really in a state of delirium, with high fever, I had
an insatiable thirst. The only liquids given me were hot saline
solutions. Though there was good reason for administering these, I
believed they were designed for no other purpose than to increase my
sufferings, as part of the same inquisitorial process. But had a
confession been due, I could hardly have made it, for that part of my
brain which controls the power of speech was seriously affected, and
was soon to be further disabled by my ungovernable thoughts. Only an
occasional word did I utter.

Certain hallucinations of hearing, or "false voices," added to my
torture. Within my range of hearing, but beyond the reach of my
understanding, there was a hellish vocal hum. Now and then I would
recognize the subdued voice of a friend; now and then I would hear the
voices of some I believed were not friends. All these referred to me
and uttered what I could not clearly distinguish, but knew must be
imprecations. Ghostly rappings on the walls and ceiling of my room
punctuated unintelligible mumblings of invisible persecutors.

I remember distinctly my delusion of the following day--Sunday. I
seemed to be no longer in the hospital. In some mysterious way I had
been spirited aboard a huge ocean liner. I first discovered this when
the ship was in mid-ocean. The day was clear, the sea apparently calm,
but for all that the ship was slowly sinking. And it was I, of course,
who had created the situation which must turn out fatally for all,
unless the coast of Europe could be reached before the water in the
hold should extinguish the fires. How had this peril overtaken us?
Simply enough: During the night I had in some way--a way still unknown
to me--opened a porthole below the water-line; and those in charge of
the vessel seemed powerless to close it. Every now and then I could
hear parts of the ship give way under the strain. I could hear the air
hiss and whistle spitefully under the resistless impact of the invading
waters; I could hear the crashing of timbers as partitions were
wrecked; and as the water rushed in at one place I could see, at
another, scores of helpless passengers swept overboard into the sea--my
unintended victims. I believed that I, too, might at any moment be
swept away. That I was not thrown into the sea by vengeful
fellow-passengers was, I thought, due to their desire to keep me alive
until, if possible, land should be reached, when a more painful death
could be inflicted upon me.

While aboard my phantom ship I managed in some way to establish an
electric railway system; and the trolley cars which passed the hospital
were soon running along the deck of my ocean liner, carrying passengers
from the places of peril to what seemed places of comparative safety at
the bow. Every time I heard a car pass the hospital, one of mine went
clanging along the ship's deck.

My feverish imaginings were no less remarkable than the external
stimuli which excited them. As I have since ascertained, there were
just outside my room an elevator and near it a speaking-tube. Whenever
the speaking-tube was used from another part of the building, the
summoning whistle conveyed to my mind the idea of the exhaustion of air
in a ship-compartment, and the opening and shutting of the elevator
door completed the illusion of a ship fast going to pieces. But the
ship my mind was on never reached any shore, nor did she sink. Like a
mirage she vanished, and again I found myself safe in my bed at the
hospital. "Safe," did I say? Scarcely that--for deliverance from one
impending disaster simply meant immediate precipitation into another.

My delirium gradually subsided, and four or five days after the 23d the
doctors were able to set my broken bones. The operation suggested new
delusions. Shortly before the adjustment of the plaster casts, my legs,
for obvious reasons, were shaved from shin to calf. This unusual
tonsorial operation I read for a sign of degradation--associating it
with what I had heard of the treatment of murderers and with similar
customs in barbarous countries. It was about this time also that strips
of court-plaster, in the form of a cross, were placed on my forehead,
which had been slightly scratched in my fall, and this, of course, I
interpreted as a brand of infamy.

Had my health been good, I should at this time have been participating
in the Triennial of my class at Yale. Indeed, I was a member of the
Triennial Committee and though, when I left New York on June 15th, I
had been feeling terribly ill, I had then hoped to take part in the
celebration. The class reunions were held on Tuesday, June 26th--three
days after my collapse. Those familiar with Yale customs know that the
Harvard baseball game is one of the chief events of the commencement
season. Headed by brass bands, all the classes whose reunions fall in
the same year march to the Yale Athletic Field to see the game and
renew their youth--using up as much vigor in one delirious day as would
insure a ripe old age if less prodigally expended. These classes, with
their bands and cheering, accompanied by thousands of other
vociferating enthusiasts, march through West Chapel Street--the most
direct route from the Campus to the Field. It is upon this line of
march that Grace Hospital is situated, and I knew that on the day of
the game the Yale thousands would pass the scene of my incarceration.

I have endured so many days of the most exquisite torture that I
hesitate to distinguish among them by degrees; each deserves its own
unique place, even as a Saint's Day in the calendar of an olden Spanish
inquisitor. But, if the palm is to be awarded to any, June 26th, 1900,
perhaps has the first claim.

My state of mind at that time might be pictured thus: The criminal
charge of attempted suicide stood against me on June 23rd. By the 26th
many other and worse charges had accumulated. The public believed me
the most despicable member of my race. The papers were filled with
accounts of my misdeeds. The thousands of collegians gathered in the
city, many of whom I knew personally, loathed the very thought that a
Yale man should so disgrace his Alma Mater. And when they approached
the hospital on their way to the Athletic Field, I concluded that it
was their intention to take me from my bed, drag me to the lawn, and
there tear me limb from limb. Few incidents during my unhappiest years
are more vividly or circumstantially impressed upon my memory. The
fear, to be sure, was absurd, but in the lurid lexicon of Unreason
there is no such word as "absurd." Believing, as I did, that I had
dishonored Yale and forfeited the privilege of being numbered among her
sons, it was not surprising that the college cheers which filled the
air that afternoon, and in which only a few days earlier I had hoped to
join, struck terror to my heart.




IV


NATURALLY I was suspicious of all about me, and became more so each
day. But not until about a month later did I refuse to recognize my
relatives. While I was at Grace Hospital, my father and eldest brother
called almost every day to see me, and, though I said little, I still
accepted them in their proper characters. I remember well a
conversation one morning with my father. The words I uttered were few,
but full of meaning. Shortly before this time my death had been
momentarily expected. I still believed that I was surely about to die
as a result of my injuries, and I wished in some way to let my father
know that, despite my apparently ignominious end, I appreciated all
that he had done for me during my life. Few men, I believe, ever had a
more painful time in expressing their feelings than I had on that
occasion. I had but little control over my mind, and my power of speech
was impaired. My father sat beside my bed. Looking up at him, I said,
"You have been a good father to me."

"I have always tried to be," was his characteristic reply.

After the broken bones had been set, and the full effects of the severe
shock I had sustained had worn off, I began to gain strength. About the
third week I was able to sit up and was occasionally taken out of doors
But each day, and especially during the hours of the night, my
delusions increased in force and variety. The world was fast becoming
to me a stage on which every human being within the range of my senses
seemed to be playing a part, and that a part which would lead not only
to my destruction (for which I cared little), but also to the ruin of
all with whom I had ever come in contact. In the month of July several
thunder-storms occurred. To me the thunder was "stage" thunder, the
lightning man-made, and the accompanying rain due to some clever
contrivance of my persecutors. There was a chapel connected with the
hospital--or at least a room where religious services were held every
Sunday. To me the hymns were funeral dirges; and the mumbled prayers,
faintly audible, were in behalf of every sufferer in the world but one.

It was my eldest brother who looked after my care and interests during
my entire illness. Toward the end of July, he informed me that I was to
be taken home again. I must have given him an incredulous look, for he
said, "Don't you think we can take you home? Well, we can and will."
Believing myself in the hands of the police, I did not see how that was
possible. Nor did I have any desire to return. That a man who had
disgraced his family should again enter his old home and expect his
relatives to treat him as though nothing were changed, was a thought
against which my soul rebelled; and, when the day came for my return, I
fought my brother and the doctor feebly as they lifted me from the bed.
But I soon submitted, was placed in a carriage, and driven to the house
I had left a month earlier.

For a few hours my mind was calmer than it had been. But my new-found
ease was soon dispelled by the appearance of a nurse--one of several
who had attended me at the hospital. Though at home and surrounded by
relatives, I jumped to the conclusion that I was still under police
surveillance. At my request my brother had promised not to engage any
nurse who had been in attendance at the hospital. The difficulty of
procuring any other led him to disregard my request, which at the time
he held simply as a whim. But he did not disregard it entirely, for the
nurse selected had merely acted as a substitute on one occasion, and
then only for about an hour. That was long enough, though, for my
memory to record her image.

Finding myself still under surveillance, I soon jumped to a second
conclusion, namely, that this was no brother of mine at all. He
instantly appeared in the light of a sinister double, acting as a
detective. After that I refused absolutely to speak to him again, and
this repudiation I extended to all other relatives, friends and
acquaintances. If the man I had accepted as my brother was spurious, so
was everybody--that was my deduction. For more than two years I was
without relatives or friends, in fact, without a world, except that one
created by my own mind from the chaos that reigned within it.

While I was at Grace Hospital, it was my sense of hearing which was the
most disturbed. But soon after I was placed in my room at home, _all_
of my senses became perverted. I still heard the "false voices"--which
were doubly false, for Truth no longer existed. The tricks played upon
me by my senses of taste, touch, smell, and sight were the source of
great mental anguish. None of my food had its usual flavor. This soon
led to that common delusion that some of it contained poison--not
deadly poison, for I knew that my enemies hated me too much to allow me
the boon of death, but poison sufficient to aggravate my discomfort. At
breakfast I had cantaloupe, liberally sprinkled with salt. The salt
seemed to pucker my mouth, and I believed it to be powdered alum.
Usually, with my supper, sliced peaches were served. Though there was
sugar on the peaches, salt would have done as well. Salt, sugar, and
powdered alum had become the same to me.

Familiar materials had acquired a different "feel." In the dark, the
bed sheets at times seemed like silk. As I had not been born with a
golden spoon in my mouth, or other accessories of a useless luxury, I
believed the detectives had provided these silken sheets for some
hostile purpose of their own. What that purpose was I could not divine,
and my very inability to arrive at a satisfactory conclusion stimulated
my brain to the assembling of disturbing thoughts in an almost endless
train.

Imaginary breezes struck my face, gentle, but not welcome, most of them
from parts of the room where currents of air could not possibly
originate. They seemed to come from cracks in the walls and ceiling and
annoyed me exceedingly. I thought them in some way related to that
ancient method of torture by which water is allowed to strike the
victim's forehead, a drop at a time, until death releases him. For a
while my sense of smell added to my troubles. The odor of burning human
flesh and other pestilential fumes seemed to assail me.

My sense of sight was subjected to many weird and uncanny effects.
Phantasmagoric visions made their visitations throughout the night, for
a time with such regularity that I used to await their coming with a
certain restrained curiosity. I was not entirely unaware that something
was ailing with my mind. Yet these illusions of sight I took for the
work of detectives, who sat up nights racking their brains in order to
rack and utterly wreck my own with a cruel and unfair Third Degree.

Handwriting on the wall has ever struck terror to the hearts of even
sane men. I remember as one of my most unpleasant experiences that I
began to see handwriting on the sheets of my bed staring me in the
face, and not me alone, but also the spurious relatives who often stood
or sat near me. On each fresh sheet placed over me I would soon begin
to see words, sentences, and signatures, all in my own handwriting. Yet
I could not decipher any of the words, and this fact dismayed me, for I
firmly believed that those who stood about could read them all and
found them to be incriminating evidence.

I imagined that these visionlike effects, with few exceptions, were
produced by a magic lantern controlled by some of my myriad
persecutors. The lantern was rather a cinematographic contrivance.
Moving pictures, often brilliantly colored, were thrown on the ceiling
of my room and sometimes on the sheets of my bed. Human bodies,
dismembered and gory, were one of the most common of these. All this
may have been due to the fact that, as a boy, I had fed my imagination
on the sensational news of the day as presented in the public press.
Despite the heavy penalty which I now paid for thus loading my mind, I
believe this unwise indulgence gave a breadth and variety to my
peculiar psychological experience which it otherwise would have lacked.
For with an insane ingenuity I managed to connect myself with almost
every crime of importance of which I had ever read.

Dismembered human bodies were not alone my bedfellows at this time. I
remember one vision of vivid beauty. Swarms of butterflies and large
and gorgeous moths appeared on the sheets. I wished that the usually
unkind operator would continue to show these pretty creatures. Another
pleasing vision appeared about twilight several days in succession. I
can trace it directly to impressions gained in early childhood. The
quaint pictures by Kate Greenaway--little children in attractive dress,
playing in old-fashioned gardens--would float through space just
outside my windows. The pictures were always accompanied by the gleeful
shouts of real children in the neighborhood, who, before being sent to
bed by watchful parents, devoted the last hour of the day to play. It
doubtless was their shouts that stirred my memories of childhood and
brought forth these pictures.

In my chamber of intermittent horrors and momentary delights, uncanny
occurrences were frequent. I believed there was some one who at fall of
night secreted himself under my bed. That in itself was not peculiar,
as sane persons at one time or another are troubled by that same
notion. But _my_ bed-fellow--under the bed--was a detective; and he
spent most of his time during the night pressing pieces of ice against
my injured heels, to precipitate, as I thought, my overdue confession.

The piece of ice in the pitcher of water which usually stood on the
table sometimes clinked against the pitcher's side as its center of
gravity shifted through melting. It was many days before I reasoned out
the cause of this sound; and until I did I supposed it was produced by
some mechanical device resorted to by the detectives for a purpose.
Thus the most trifling occurrence assumed for me vast significance.




V


After remaining at home for about a month, during which time I showed
no improvement mentally, though I did gain physically, I was taken to a
private sanatorium. My destination was frankly disclosed to me. But my
habit of disbelief had now become fixed, and I thought myself on the
way to a trial in New York City, for some one of the many crimes with
which I stood charged.

My emotions on leaving New Haven were, I imagine, much the same as
those of a condemned but penitent criminal who looks upon the world for
the last time. The day was hot, and, as we drove to the railway
station, the blinds on most of the houses in the streets through which
we passed were seen to be closed. The reason for this was not then
apparent to me. I thought I saw an unbroken line of deserted houses,
and I imagined that their desertion had been deliberately planned as a
sign of displeasure on the part of their former occupants. As citizens
of New Haven, I supposed them bitterly ashamed of such a despicable
townsman as myself. Because of the early hour, the streets were
practically deserted. This fact, too, I interpreted to my own
disadvantage. As the carriage crossed the main business thoroughfare, I
took what I believed to be my last look at that part of my native city.

From the carriage I was carried to the train and placed in the smoking
car in the last seat on the right-hand side. The back of the seat next
in front was reversed so that my legs might be placed in a comfortable
position, and one of the boards used by card-playing travelers was
placed beneath them as a support. With a consistent degree of suspicion
I paid particular attention to a blue mark on the face of the railroad
ticket held by my custodian. I took it to be a means of identification
for use in court.

That one's memory may perform its function in the grip of Unreason
itself is proved by the fact that my memory retains an impression, and
an accurate one, of virtually everything that befell me, except when
under the influence of an anaesthetic or in the unconscious hours of
undisturbed sleep. Important events, trifling conversations, and more
trifling thoughts of my own are now recalled with ease and accuracy;
whereas, prior to my illness and until a strange experience to be
recorded later, mine was an ordinary memory when it was not noticeably
poor. At school and in college I stood lowest in those studies in which
success depended largely upon this faculty. Psychiatrists inform me
that it is not unusual for those suffering as I did to retain accurate
impressions of their experiences while ill. To laymen this may seem
almost miraculous, yet it is not so; nor is it even remarkable.
Assuming that an insane person's memory is capable of recording
impressions at all, remembrance for one in the torturing grip of
delusions of persecution should be doubly easy. This deduction is in
accord with the accepted psychological law that the retention of an
impression in the memory depends largely upon the intensity of the
impression itself, and the frequency of its repetition. Fear to speak,
lest I should incriminate myself and others, gave to my impressions the
requisite intensity, and the daily recurrence of the same general line
of thought served to fix all impressions in my then supersensitive
memory.

Shortly before seven in the morning, on the way to the sanatorium, the
train passed through a manufacturing center. Many workmen were lounging
in front of a factory, most of them reading newspapers. I believed
these papers contained an account of me and my crimes, and I thought
everyone along the route knew who I was and what I was, and that I was
on that train. Few seemed to pay any attention to me, yet this very
fact looked to be a part of some well-laid plan of the detectives.

The sanatorium to which I was going was in the country. When a certain
station was reached, I was carried from the train to a carriage. At
that moment I caught sight of a former college acquaintance, whose
appearance I thought was designed to let me know that Yale, which I
believed I had disgraced, was one of the powers behind my throne of
torture.

Soon after I reached my room in the sanatorium, the supervisor entered.
Drawing a table close to the bed, he placed upon it a slip of paper
which he asked me to sign. I looked upon this as a trick of the
detectives to get a specimen of my handwriting. I now know that the
signing of the slip is a legal requirement, with which every patient is
supposed to comply upon entering such an institution--private in
character--unless he has been committed by some court. The exact
wording of this "voluntary commitment" I do not now recall; but, it
was, in substance, an agreement to abide by the rules of the
institution--whatever _they_ were--and to submit to such restraint as
might be deemed necessary. Had I not felt the weight of the world on my
shoulders, I believe my sense of humor would have caused me to laugh
outright; for the signing of such an agreement by one so situated was,
even to my mind, a farce. After much coaxing I was induced to go so far
as to take the pen in my hand. There I again hesitated. The supervisor
apparently thought I might write with more ease if the paper were
placed on a book. And so I might, had he selected a book of a different
title. One more likely to arouse suspicions in my mind could not have
been found in a search of the Congressional Library. I had left New
York on June 15th, and it was in the direction of that city that my
present trip had taken me. I considered this but the first step of my
return under the auspices of its Police Department. "Called Back" was
the title of the book that stared me in the face. After refusing for a
long time I finally weakened and signed the slip; but I did not place
it on the book. To have done that would, in my mind, have been
tantamount to giving consent to extradition; and I was in no mood to
assist the detectives in their mean work. At what cost had I signed
that commitment slip? To me it was the act of signing my own
death-warrant.




VI


During the entire time that my delusions of persecution, as they are
called, persisted, I could not but respect the mind that had laid out
so comprehensive and devilishly ingenious and, at times, artistic a
Third Degree as I was called upon to bear. And an innate modesty (more
or less fugitive since these peculiar experiences) does not forbid my
mentioning the fact that I still respect that mind.

Suffering such as I endured during the month of August in my own home
continued with gradually diminishing force during the eight months I
remained in this sanatorium. Nevertheless my sufferings during the
first four of these eight months was intense. All my senses were still
perverted. My sense of sight was the first to right itself--nearly
enough, at least, to rob the detectives of their moving pictures. But
before the last fitful film had run through my mind, I beheld one which
I shall now describe. I can trace it directly to an impression made on
my memory about two years earlier, before my breakdown.

Shortly after going to New York to live, I had explored the Eden Musée.
One of the most gruesome of the spectacles which I had seen in its
famed Chamber of Horrors was a representation of a gorilla, holding in
its arms the gory body of a woman. It was that impression which now
revived in my mind. But by a process strictly in accordance with
Darwin's theory, the Eden Musée gorilla had become a man--in appearance
not unlike the beast that had inspired my distorted thought. This man
held a bloody dagger which he repeatedly plunged into the woman's
breast. The apparition did not terrify me at all. In fact I found it
interesting, for I looked upon it as a contrivance of the detectives.
Its purpose I could not divine, but this fact did not trouble me, as I
reasoned that no additional criminal charges could make my situation
worse than it already was.

For a month or two, "false voices" continued to annoy me. And if there
is a hell conducted on the principles of my temporary hell, gossippers
will one day wish they had attended strictly to their own business.
This is not a confession. I am no gossipper, though I cannot deny that
I have occasionally gossipped--a little. And this was my punishment:
persons in an adjoining room seemed to be repeating the very same
things which I had said of others on these communicative occasions. I
supposed that those whom I had talked about had in some way found me
out, and intended now to take their revenge.

My sense of smell, too, became normal; but my sense of taste was slow
in recovering. At each meal, poison was still the _pièce de
résistance_, and it was not surprising that I sometimes dallied one,
two, or three hours over a meal, and often ended by not eating it at
all.

There was, however, another reason for my frequent refusal to take
food, in my belief that the detectives had resorted to a more subtle
method of detection. They now intended by each article of food to
suggest a certain idea, and I was expected to recognize the idea thus
suggested. Conviction or acquittal depended upon my correct
interpretation of their symbols, and my interpretation was to be
signified by my eating, or not eating, the several kinds of food placed
before me. To have eaten a burnt crust of bread would have been a
confession of arson. Why? Simply because the charred crust suggested
fire; and, as bread is the staff of life, would it not be an inevitable
deduction that life had been destroyed--destroyed by fire--and that I
was the destroyer? On one day to eat a given article of food meant
confession. The next day, or the next meal, a refusal to eat it meant
confession. This complication of logic made it doubly difficult for me
to keep from incriminating myself and others.

It can easily be seen that I was between several devils and the deep
sea. To eat or not to eat perplexed me more than the problem conveyed
by a few shorter words perplexed a certain prince, who, had he lived a
few centuries later (out of a book), might have been forced to enter a
kingdom where kings and princes are made and unmade on short notice.
Indeed, he might have lost his principality entirely--or, at least, his
subjects; for, as I later had occasion to observe, the frequency with
which a dethroned reason mounts a throne and rules a world is such that
self-crowned royalty receives but scant homage from the less elated
members of the court.

For several weeks I ate but little. Though the desire for food was not
wanting, my mind (that dog-in-the-manger) refused to let me satisfy my
hunger. Coaxing by the attendants was of little avail; force was
usually of less. But the threat that liquid nourishment would be
administered through my nostrils sometimes prevailed for the attribute
of shrewdness was not so utterly lost that I could not choose the less
of two evils.

What I looked upon as a gastronomic ruse of the detectives sometimes
overcame my fear of eating. Every Sunday ice cream was served with
dinner. At the beginning of the meal a large pyramid of it would be
placed before me in a saucer several sizes too small. I believed that
it was never to be mine unless I first partook of the more substantial
fare. As I dallied over the meal, that delicious pyramid would
gradually melt, slowly filling the small saucer, which I knew could not
long continue to hold all of its original contents. As the melting of
the ice cream progressed, I became more indifferent to my eventual
fate; and, invariably, before a drop of that precious reward had
dripped from the saucer, I had eaten enough of the dinner to prove my
title to the seductive dessert. Moreover, during its enjoyment, I no
longer cared a whit for charges or convictions of all the crimes in the
calendar. This fact is less trifling than it seems; for it proves the
value of strategy as opposed to brute and sometimes brutal force, of
which I shall presently give some illuminating examples.




VII


Choice of a sanatorium by people of limited means is, unfortunately,
very restricted. Though my relatives believed the one in which I was
placed was at least fairly well conducted, events proved otherwise.
From a modest beginning made not many years previously, it had enjoyed
a mushroom growth. About two hundred and fifty patients were harbored
in a dozen or more small frame buildings, suggestive of a mill
settlement. Outside the limits of a city and in a state where there was
lax official supervision, owing in part to faulty laws, the owner of
this little settlement of woe had erected a nest of veritable
fire-traps in which helpless sick people were forced to risk their
lives. This was a necessary procedure if the owner was to grind out an
exorbitant income on his investment.

The same spirit of economy and commercialism pervaded the entire
institution. Its worst manifestation was in the employment of the
meanest type of attendant--men willing to work for the paltry wage of
eighteen dollars a month. Very seldom did competent attendants consent
to work there, and then usually because of a scarcity of profitable
employment elsewhere. Providentially for me, such an attendant came
upon the scene. This young man, so long as he remained in the good
graces of the owner-superintendent, was admittedly one of the best
attendants he had ever had. Yet aside from a five-dollar bill which a
relative had sent me at Christmas and which I had refused to accept
because of my belief that it, like my relatives, was counterfeit--aside
from that bill, which was turned over to the attendant by my brother,
he received no additional pecuniary rewards. His chief reward lay in
his consciousness of the fact that he was protecting me against
injustices which surely would have been visited upon me had he quitted
his position and left me to the mercies of the owner and his ignorant
assistants. To-day, with deep appreciation, I contrast the treatment I
received at his hands with that which I suffered during the three weeks
preceding his appearance on the scene. During that period, no fewer
than seven attendants contributed to my misery. Though some of them
were perhaps decent enough fellows outside a sickroom, not one had the
right to minister to a patient in my condition.

The two who were first put in charge of me did not strike me with their
fists or even threaten to do so; but their unconscious lack of
consideration for my comfort and peace of mind was torture. They were
typical eighteen-dollar-a-month attendants. Another of the same sort,
on one occasion, cursed me with a degree of brutality which I prefer
not to recall, much less record. And a few days later the climax was
appropriately capped when still another attendant perpetrated an
outrage which a sane man would have resented to the point of homicide.
He was a man of the coarsest type. His hands would have done credit to
a longshoreman--fingers knotted and nearly twice the normal size.
Because I refused to obey a peremptory command, and this at a time when
I habitually refused even on pain of imagined torture to obey or to
speak, this brute not only cursed me with abandon, he deliberately spat
upon me. I was a mental incompetent, but like many others in a similar
position I was both by antecedents and by training a gentleman. Vitriol
could not have seared my flesh more deeply than the venom of this human
viper stung my soul! Yet, as I was rendered speechless by delusions, I
could offer not so much as a word of protest. I trust that it is not
now too late, however, to protest in behalf of the thousands of
outraged patients in private and state hospitals whose mute submission
to such indignities has never been recorded.

Of the readiness of an unscrupulous owner to employ inferior
attendants, I shall offer a striking illustration. The capable
attendant who acted as my protector at this sanatorium has given me an
affidavit embodying certain facts which, of course, I could not have
known at the time of their occurrence. The gist of this sworn statement
is as follows: One day a man--seemingly a tramp--approached the main
building of the sanatorium and inquired for the owner. He soon found
him, talked with him a few minutes, and an hour or so later he was
sitting at the bedside of an old and infirm man. This aged patient had
recently been committed to the institution by relatives who had labored
under the common delusion that the payment of a considerable sum of
money each week would insure kindly treatment. When this
tramp-attendant first appeared, all his visible worldly possessions
were contained in a small bundle which he carried under his arm. So
filthy were his person and his clothes that he received a compulsory
bath and another suit before being assigned to duty. He then began to
earn his four dollars and fifty cents a week by sitting several hours a
day in the room with the aged man, sick unto death. My informant soon
engaged him in conversation. What did he learn? First, that the uncouth
stranger had never before so much as crossed the threshold of a
hospital. His last job had been as a member of a section-gang on a
railroad. From the roadbed of a railway to the bedside of a man about
to die was indeed a change which might have taxed the adaptability of a
more versatile being. But coarse as he was, this unkempt novice did not
abuse his charge--except in so far as his inability to interpret or
anticipate wants contributed to the sick man's distress. My own
attendant, realizing that the patient was suffering for the want of
skilled attention, spent a part of his time in this unhappy room, which
was but across the hall from my own. The end soon came.

My attendant, who had had training as a nurse, detected the
unmistakable signs of impending death. He forthwith informed the owner
of the sanatorium that the patient was in a dying condition, and urged
him (a doctor) to go at once to the bedside. The doctor refused to
comply with the request on the plea that he was at the time "too busy."
When at last he did visit the room, the patient was dead. Then came the
supervisor, who took charge of the body. As it was being carried from
the room the supervisor, the "handy man" of the owner, said: "There
goes the best paying patient the institution had; the doctor" (meaning
the owner) "was getting eighty-five dollars a week out of him." Of this
sum not more than twenty dollars at most, at the time this happened,
could be considered as "cost of maintenance." The remaining sixty-five
dollars went into the pocket of the owner. Had the man lived for one
year, the owner might have pocketed (so far as this one case was
concerned) the neat but wicked profit of thirty-three hundred and
eighty dollars. And what would the patient have received? The same
privilege of living in neglect and dying neglected.




VIII


For the first few weeks after my arrival at the sanatorium, I was cared
for by two attendants, one by day and one by night. I was still
helpless, being unable to put my feet out of bed, much less upon the
floor, and it was necessary that I be continually watched lest an
impulse to walk should seize me. After a month or six weeks, however, I
grew stronger, and from that time only one person was assigned to care
for me. He was with me all day, and slept at night in the same room.

The earliest possible dismissal of one of my two attendants was
expedient for the family purse; but such are the deficiencies in the
prevailing treatment of the insane that relief in one direction often
occasions evil in another. No sooner was the expense thus reduced than
I was subjected to a detestable form of restraint which amounted to
torture. To guard me at night while the remaining attendant slept, my
hands were imprisoned in what is known as a "muff." A muff, innocent
enough to the eyes of those who have never worn one, is in reality a
relic of the Inquisition. It is an instrument of restraint which has
been in use for centuries and even in many of our public and private
institutions is still in use. The muff I wore was made of canvas, and
differed in construction from a muff designed for the hands of fashion
only in the inner partition, also of canvas, which separated my hands,
but allowed them to overlap. At either end was a strap which buckled
tightly around the wrist and was locked.

The assistant physician, when he announced to me that I was to be
subjected at night to this restraint, broke the news gently--so gently
that I did not then know, nor did I guess for several months, why this
thing was done to me. And thus it was that I drew deductions of my own
which added not a little to my torture.

The gas jet in my room was situated at a distance, and stronger light
was needed to find the keyholes and lock the muff when adjusted. Hence,
an attendant was standing by with a lighted candle. Seating himself on
the side of the bed, the physician said: "You won't try again to do
what you did in New Haven, will you?" Now one may have done many things
in a city where he has lived for a score of years, and it is not
surprising that I failed to catch the meaning of the doctor's question.
It was only after months of secret puzzling that I at last did discover
his reference to my attempted suicide. But now the burning candle in
the hands of the attendant, and a certain similarity between the
doctor's name and the name of a man whose trial for arson I once
attended out of idle curiosity, led me to imagine that in some way I
had been connected with that crime. For months I firmly believed I
stood charged as an accomplice.

The putting on of the muff was the most humiliating incident of my
life. The shaving of my legs and the wearing of the court-plaster brand
of infamy had been humiliating, but those experiences had not
overwhelmed my very heart as did this bitter ordeal. I resisted weakly,
and, after the muff was adjusted and locked, for the first time since
my mental collapse I wept. And I remember distinctly why I wept. The
key that locked the muff unlocked in imagination the door of the home
in New Haven which I believed I had disgraced--and seemed for a time to
unlock my heart. Anguish beat my mind into a momentary sanity, and with
a wholly sane emotion I keenly felt my imagined disgrace. My thoughts
centred on my mother. Her (and other members of the family) I could
plainly see at home in a state of dejection and despair over her
imprisoned and heartless son. I wore the muff each night for several
weeks, and for the first few nights the unhappy glimpses of a ruined
home recurred and increased my sufferings.

It was not always as an instrument of restraint that the muff was
employed. Frequently it was used as a means of discipline on account of
supposed stubborn disobedience. Many times was I roughly overpowered by
two attendants who locked my hands and coerced me to do whatever I had
refused to do. My arms and hands were my only weapons of defence. My
feet were still in plaster casts, and my back had been so severely
injured as to necessitate my lying flat upon it most of the time. It
was thus that these unequal fights were fought. And I had not even the
satisfaction of tongue-lashing my oppressors, for I was practically
speechless.

My attendants, like most others in such institutions, were incapable of
understanding the operations of my mind, and what they could not
understand they would seldom tolerate. Yet they were not entirely to
blame. They were simply carrying out to the letter orders received from
the doctors.

To ask a patient in my condition to take a little medicated sugar
seemed reasonable. But from my point of view my refusal was
justifiable. That innocuous sugar disc to me seemed saturated with the
blood of loved ones; and so much as to touch it was to shed their
blood--perhaps on the very scaffold on which I was destined to die. For
myself I cared little. I was anxious to die, and eagerly would I have
taken the sugar disc had I had any reason to believe that it was deadly
poison. The sooner I could die and be forgotten, the better for all
with whom I had ever come in contact. To continue to live was simply to
be the treacherous tool of unscrupulous detectives, eager to
exterminate my innocent relatives and friends, if so their fame could
be made secure in the annals of their craft.

But the thoughts associated with the taking of the medicine were seldom
twice alike. If before taking it something happened to remind me of
mother, father, some other relative, or a friend, I imagined that
compliance would compromise, if not eventually destroy, that particular
person. Who would not resist when meek acceptance would be a confession
which would doom his own mother or father to prison, or ignominy, or
death? It was for this that I was reviled, for this, subjected to cruel
restraint.

They thought I was stubborn. In the strict sense of the word there is
no such thing as a stubborn insane person. The truly stubborn men and
women in the world are sane; and the fortunate prevalence of sanity may
be approximately estimated by the preponderance of stubbornness in
society at large. When one possessed of the power of recognizing his
own errors continues to hold an unreasonable belief--that is
stubbornness. But for a man bereft of reason to adhere to an idea which
to him seems absolutely correct and true because he has been deprived
of the means of detecting his error--that is not stubbornness. It is a
symptom of his disease, and merits the indulgence of forbearance, if
not genuine sympathy. Certainly the afflicted one deserves no
punishment. As well punish with a blow the cheek that is disfigured by
the mumps.

The attendant who was with me most of the time while I remained at the
sanatorium was the kindly one already mentioned. Him I regarded,
however, as a detective, or, rather, as two detectives, one of whom
watched me by day, and the other--a perfect double--by night. He was an
enemy, and his professed sympathy--which I now know was genuine--only
made me hate him the more. As he was ignorant of the methods of
treatment in vogue in hospitals for the insane, it was several weeks
before he dared put in jeopardy his position by presuming to shield me
against unwise orders of the doctors. But when at last he awoke to the
situation, he repeatedly intervened in my behalf. More than once the
doctor who was both owner and superintendent threatened to discharge
him for alleged officiousness. But better judgment usually held the
doctor's wrath in check, for he realized that not one attendant in a
hundred was so competent.

Not only did the friendly attendant frequently exhibit more wisdom than
the superintendent, but he also obeyed the dictates of a better
conscience than that of his nominal superior, the assistant physician.
On three occasions this man treated me with a signal lack of
consideration, and in at least one instance he was vicious. When this
latter incident occurred, I was both physically and mentally helpless.
My feet were swollen and still in plaster bandages. I was all but mute,
uttering only an occasional expletive when forced to perform acts
against my will.

One morning Doctor No-name (he represents a type) entered my room.

"Good morning! How are you feeling?" he asked.

No answer.

"Aren't you feeling well?"

No answer.

"Why don't you talk?" he asked with irritation.

Still no answer, except perhaps a contemptuous look such as is so often
the essence of eloquence. Suddenly, and without the slightest warning,
as a petulant child locked in a room for disobedience might treat a
pillow, he seized me by an arm and jerked me from the bed. It was
fortunate that the bones of my ankles and feet, not yet thoroughly
knitted, were not again injured. And this was the performance of the
very man who had locked my hands in the muff, that I might not injure
myself!

"Why don't you talk?" he again asked.

Though rather slow in replying, I will take pleasure in doing so by
sending that doctor a copy of this book--my answer--if he will but send
me his address.

It is not a pleasant duty to brand any physician for cruelty and
incompetence, for the worst that ever lived has undoubtedly done many
good deeds. But here is the type of man that has wrought havoc among
the helpless insane. And the owner represented a type that has too long
profited through the misfortunes of others. "Pay the price or put your
relative in a public institution!" is the burden of his discordant song
before commitment. "Pay or get out!" is his jarring refrain when
satisfied that the family's resources are exhausted. I later learned
that this grasping owner had bragged of making a profit of $98,000 in a
single year. About twenty years later he left an estate of
approximately $1,500,000. Some of the money, however, wrung from
patients and their relatives in the past may yet benefit similar
sufferers in the future, for, under the will of the owner, several
hundred thousand dollars will eventually be available as an endowment
for the institution.

It was at the sanatorium that my ankles were finally restored to a
semblance of their former utility. They were there subjected to a
course of heroic treatment; but as to-day they permit me to walk, run,
dance, and play tennis and golf, as do those who have never been
crippled, my hours of torture endured under my first attempts to walk
are almost pleasant to recall. About five months from the date of my
injury I was allowed, or rather compelled, to place my feet on the
floor and attempt to walk. My ankles were still swollen, absolutely
without action, and acutely sensitive to the slightest pressure. From
the time they were hurt until I again began to talk--two years later--I
asked not one question as to the probability of my ever regaining the
use of them. The fact was, I never expected to walk naturally again.
The desire of the doctors to have me walk I believed to be inspired by
the detectives, of whom, indeed, I supposed the doctor himself to be
one. Had there been any confession to make, I am sure it would have
been yielded under the stress of this ultimate torture. The million
needle points which, just prior to my mental collapse, seemed to goad
my brain, now centred their unwelcome attention on the soles of my
feet. Had the floor been studded with minute stilettos my sufferings
could hardly have been more intense. For several weeks assistance was
necessary with each attempt to walk, and each attempt was an ordeal.
Sweat stood in beads on either foot, wrung from my blood by agony.
Believing that it would be only a question of time when I should be
tried, condemned, and executed for some one of my countless felonies, I
thought that the attempt to prevent my continuing a cripple for the
brief remainder of my days was prompted by anything but benevolence.

The superintendent would have proved himself more humane had he not
peremptorily ordered my attendant to discontinue the use of a support
which, until the plaster bandages were removed, had enabled me to keep
my legs in a horizontal position when I sat up. His order was that I
should put my legs down and keep them down, whether it hurt or not. The
pain was of course intense when the blood again began to circulate
freely through tissues long unused to its full pressure, and so evident
was my distress that the attendant ignored the doctor's command and
secretly favored me. He would remove the forbidden support for only a
few minutes at a time, gradually lengthening the intervals until at
last I was able to do without the support entirely. Before long and
each day for several weeks I was forced at first to stagger and finally
to walk across the room and back to the bed. The distance was increased
as the pain diminished, until I was able to walk without more
discomfort than a comparatively pleasant sensation of lameness. For at
least two months after my feet first touched the floor I had to be
carried up and downstairs, and for several months longer I went
flat-footed.

Delusions of persecution--which include "delusions of
self-reference"--though a source of annoyance while I was in an
inactive state, annoyed and distressed me even more when I began to
move about and was obliged to associate with other patients. To my
mind, not only were the doctors and attendants detectives; each patient
was a detective and the whole institution was a part of the Third
Degree. Scarcely any remark was made in my presence that I could not
twist into a cleverly veiled reference to myself. In each person I
could see a resemblance to persons I had known, or to the principals or
victims of the crimes with which I imagined myself charged. I refused
to read; for to read veiled charges and fail to assert my innocence was
to incriminate both myself and others. But I looked with longing
glances upon all printed matter and, as my curiosity was continually
piqued, this enforced abstinence grew to be well-nigh intolerable.

It became again necessary to the family purse that every possible
saving be made. Accordingly, I was transferred from the main building,
where I had a private room and a special attendant, to a ward where I
was to mingle, under an aggregate sort of supervision, with fifteen or
twenty other patients. Here I had no special attendant by day, though
one slept in my room at night.

Of this ward I had heard alarming reports--and these from the lips of
several attendants. I was, therefore, greatly disturbed at the proposed
change. But, the transfer once accomplished, after a few days I really
liked my new quarters better than the old. During the entire time I
remained at the sanatorium I was more alert mentally than I gave
evidence of being. But not until after my removal to this ward, where I
was left alone for hours every day, did I dare to show my alertness.
Here I even went so far on one occasion as to joke with the attendant
in charge. He had been trying to persuade me to take a bath. I refused,
mainly because I did not like the looks of the bath room, which, with
its cement floor and central drain, resembled the room in which
vehicles are washed in a modern stable. After all else had failed, the
attendant tried the rôle of sympathizer.

"Now I know just how you feel," he said, "I can put myself in your
place."

"Well, if you can, do it and take the bath yourself," was my retort.

The remark is brilliant by contrast with the dismal source from which
it escaped. "Escaped" is the word; for the fear that I should hasten my
trial by exhibiting too great a gain in health, mental or physical, was
already upon me; and it controlled much of my conduct during the
succeeding months of depression.

Having now no special attendant, I spent many hours in my room, alone,
but not absolutely alone, for somewhere the eye of a detective was
evermore upon me. Comparative solitude, however, gave me courage; and
soon I began to read, regardless of consequences. During the entire
period of my depression, every publication seemed to have been written
and printed for me, and me alone. Books, magazines, and newspapers
seemed to be special editions. The fact that I well knew how inordinate
would be the cost of such a procedure in no way shook my belief in it.
Indeed, that I was costing my persecutors fabulous amounts of money was
a source of secret satisfaction. My belief in special editions of
newspapers was strengthened by items which seemed too trivial to
warrant publication in any except editions issued for a special
purpose. I recall a seemingly absurd advertisement, in which the
phrase, "Green Bluefish," appeared. At the time I did not know that
"green" was a term used to denote "fresh" or "unsalted."

During the earliest stages of my illness I had lost count of time, and
the calendar did not right itself until the day when I largely regained
my reason. Meanwhile, the date on each newspaper was, according to my
reckoning, two weeks out of the way. This confirmed my belief in the
special editions as a part of the Third Degree.

Most sane people think that no insane person can reason logically. But
this is not so. Upon unreasonable premises I made most reasonable
deductions, and that at the time when my mind was in its most disturbed
condition. Had the newspapers which I read on the day which I supposed
to be February 1st borne a January date, I might not then, for so long
a time, have believed in special editions. Probably I should have
inferred that the regular editions had been held back. But the
newspapers I had were dated about two weeks _ahead_. Now if a sane
person on February 1st receives a newspaper dated February 14th, be
will be fully justified in thinking something wrong, either with the
publication or with himself. But the shifted calendar which had planted
itself in my mind meant as much to me as the true calendar does to any
sane business man. During the seven hundred and ninety-eight days of
depression I drew countless incorrect deductions. But, such as they
were, they were deductions, and essentially the mental process was not
other than that which takes place in a well-ordered mind.

My gradually increasing vitality, although it increased my fear of
trial, impelled me to take new risks. I began to read not only
newspapers, but also such books as were placed within my reach. Yet had
they not been placed there, I should have gone without them, for I
would never ask even for what I greatly desired and knew I could have
for the asking.

Whatever love of literature I now have dates from this time, when I was
a mental incompetent and confined in an institution. Lying on a shelf
in my room was a book by George Eliot. For several days I cast longing
glances at it and finally plucked up the courage to take little nibbles
now and then. These were so good that I grew bold and at last began
openly to read the book. Its contents at the time made but little
impression on my mind, but I enjoyed it. I read also some of Addison's
essays; and had I been fortunate enough to have made myself familiar
with these earlier in life, I might have been spared the delusion that
I could detect, in many passages, the altering hand of my persecutors.

The friendly attendant, from whom I was now separated, tried to send
his favors after me into my new quarters. At first he came in person to
see me, but the superintendent soon forbade that, and also ordered him
not to communicate with me in any way. It was this disagreement, and
others naturally arising between such a doctor and such an attendant,
that soon brought about the discharge of the latter. But "discharge" is
hardly the word, for he had become disgusted with the institution, and
had remained so long only because of his interest in me. Upon leaving,
he informed the owner that he would soon cause my removal from the
institution. This he did. I left the sanatorium in March, 1901, and
remained for three months in the home of this kindly fellow, who lived
with a grandmother and an aunt in Wallingford, a town not far from New
Haven.

It is not to be inferred that I entertained any affection for my
friendly keeper. I continued to regard him as an enemy; and my life at
his home became a monotonous round of displeasure. I took my three
meals a day. I would sit listlessly for hours at a time in the house.
Daily I went out--accompanied, of course--for short walks about the
town. These were not enjoyable. I believed everybody was familiar with
my black record and expected me to be put to death. Indeed, I wondered
why passers-by did not revile or even stone me. Once I was sure I heard
a little girl call me "Traitor!" That, I believe, was my last "false
voice," but it made such an impression that I can even now recall
vividly the appearance of that dreadful child. It was not surprising
that a piece of rope, old and frayed, which someone had carelessly
thrown on a hedge by a cemetery that I sometimes passed, had for me
great significance.

During these three months I again refused to read books, though within
my reach, but I sometimes read newspapers. Still I would not speak,
except under some unusual stress of emotion. The only time I took the
initiative in this regard while living in the home of my attendant was
on a bitterly cold and snowy day when I had the temerity to tell him
that the wind had blown the blanket from a horse that had been standing
for a long time in front of the house. The owner had come inside to
transact some business with my attendant's relatives. In appearance he
reminded me of the uncle to whom this book is dedicated. I imagined the
mysterious caller was impersonating him and, by one of my curious
mental processes, I deduced that it was incumbent on me to do for the
dumb beast outside what I knew my uncle would have done had he been
aware of its plight. My reputation for decency of feeling I believed to
be gone forever; but I could not bear, in this situation, to be
unworthy of my uncle, who, among those who knew him, was famous for his
kindliness and humanity.

My attendant and his relatives were very kind and very patient, for I
was still intractable. But their efforts to make me comfortable, so far
as they had any effect, made keener my desire to kill myself. I shrank
from death; but I preferred to die by my own hand and take the blame
for it, rather than to be executed and bring lasting disgrace on my
family, friends, and, I may add with truth, on Yale. For I reasoned
that parents throughout the country would withhold their sons from a
university which numbered among its graduates such a despicable being.
But from any tragic act I was providentially restrained by the very
delusion which gave birth to the desire--in a way which signally
appeared on a later and, to me, a memorable day.




X


I am in a position not unlike that of a man whose obituary notice has
appeared prematurely. Few have ever had a better opportunity than I to
test the affection of their relatives and friends. That mine did their
duty and did it willingly is naturally a constant source of
satisfaction to me. Indeed, I believe that this unbroken record of
devotion is one of the factors which eventually made it possible for me
to take up again my duties in the social and business world, with a
comfortable feeling of continuity. I can, indeed, now view my past in
as matter-of-fact a way as do those whose lives have been uniformly
uneventful.

As I have seen scores of patients neglected by their relatives--a
neglect which they resent and often brood upon--my sense of gratitude
is the livelier, and especially so because of the difficulty with which
friendly intercourse with me was maintained during two of the three
years I was ill. Relatives and friends frequently called to see me.
True, these calls were trying for all concerned. I spoke to none, not
even to my mother and father. For, though they all appeared about as
they used to do, I was able to detect some slight difference in look or
gesture or intonation of voice, and this was enough to confirm my
belief that they were impersonators, engaged in a conspiracy, not
merely to entrap me, but to incriminate those whom they impersonated.
It is not strange, then, that I refused to say anything to them, or to
permit them to come near me. To have kissed the woman who was my
mother, but whom I believed to be a federal conspirator, would have
been an act of betrayal. These interviews were much harder for my
relatives and friends than for me. But even for me they were ordeals;
and though I suffered less at these moments than my callers, my sum of
suffering was greater, for I was constantly anticipating these
unwelcome, but eventually beneficial, visitations.

Suppose my relatives and friends had held aloof during this apparently
hopeless period, what to-day would be my feelings toward them? Let
others answer. For over two years I considered all letters forgeries.
Yet the day came when I convinced myself of their genuineness and the
genuineness of the love of those who sent them. Perhaps persons who
have relatives among the more than a quarter of a million patients in
institutions in this country to-day will find some comfort in this
fact. To be on the safe and humane side, let every relative and friend
of persons so afflicted remember the Golden Rule, which has never been
suspended with respect to the insane. Go to see them, treat them
sanely, write to them, keep them informed about the home circle; let
not your devotion flag, nor accept any repulse.

The consensus now was that my condition was unlikely ever to improve,
and the question of my commitment to some institution where incurable
cases could be cared for came up for decision. While it was being
considered, my attendant kept assuring me that it would be unnecessary
to commit me to an institution if I would but show some improvement. So
he repeatedly suggested that I go to New Haven and spend a day at home.
At this time, it will be recalled, I was all but mute, so, being unable
to beguile me into speech, the attendant one morning laid out for my
use a more fashionable shirt than I usually wore, telling me to put it
on if I wished to make the visit. That day it took me an unusually long
time to dress, but in the end I put on the designated garment. Thus did
one part of my brain outwit another.

I simply chose the less of two evils. The greater was to find myself
again committed to an institution. Nothing else would have induced me
to go to New Haven. I did not wish to go. To my best knowledge and
belief, I had no home there, nor did I have any relatives or friends
who would greet me upon my return. How could they, if still free, even
approach me while I was surrounded by detectives? Then, too, I had a
lurking suspicion that my attendant's offer was made in the belief that
I would not dare accept it. By taking him at his word, I knew that I
should at least have an opportunity to test the truth of many of his
statements regarding my old home. Life had become insupportable; and
back of my consent to make this experimental visit was a willingness to
beard the detectives in their own den, regardless of consequences. With
these and many other reflections I started for the train. The events of
the journey which followed are of no moment. We soon reached the New
Haven station; and, as I had expected, no relative or friend was there
to greet us. This apparent indifference seemed to support my suspicion
that my attendant had not told me the truth; but I found little
satisfaction in uncovering his deceit, for the more of a liar I proved
him to be, the worse would be my plight. We walked to the front of the
station and stood there for almost half an hour. The unfortunate, but
perfectly natural, wording of a question caused the delay.

"Well, shall we go home?" my attendant said.

How could I say, "Yes"? I had no home. I feel sure I should finally
have said, "No", had he continued to put the question in that form.
Consciously or unconsciously, however, he altered it. "Shall we go to
30 Trumbull Street?" That was what I had been waiting for. Certainly I
would go to the house designated by that number. I had come to New
Haven to see that house; and I had just a faint hope that its
appearance and the appearance of its occupants might prove convincing.

At home my visit came as a complete surprise. I could not believe that
my relatives--if they were relatives--had not been informed of my
presence in the city, and their words and actions upon my arrival
confirmed my suspicion and extinguished the faint hope I had briefly
cherished. My hosts were simply the same old persecutors with whom I
had already had too much to do. Soon after my arrival, dinner was
served. I sat at my old place at the table, and secretly admired the
skill with which he who asked the blessing imitated the language and
the well-remembered intonation of my father's voice. But alas for the
family!--I imagined my relatives banished and languishing in prison,
and the old home confiscated by the government!




XI


Though my few hours at home failed to prove that I did not belong in an
institution, it served one good purpose. Certain relatives who had
objected to my commitment now agreed that there was no alternative,
and, accordingly, my eldest brother caused himself to be appointed my
conservator. He had long favored taking such action, but other
relatives had counseled delay. They had been deterred by that inbred
dread of seeing a member of the family branded by law as a mental
incompetent, and, to a degree, stigmatized by the prevailing
unwarranted attitude of the public toward mental illness and the
institutions in which mental cases are treated. The very thought was
repellent; and a mistaken sense of duty--and perhaps a suggestion of
pride--led them to wish me out of such an institution as long as
possible.

Though at the time I dreaded commitment, it was the best possible thing
that could befall me. To be, as I was, in the world but not of it, was
exasperating. The constant friction that is inevitable under such
conditions--conditions such as existed for me in the home of my
attendant--can only aggravate the mental disturbance. Especially is
this true of those laboring under delusions of persecution. Such
delusions multiply with the complexity of the life led. It is the
even-going routine of institutional life which affords the
indispensable quieting effect--provided that routine is well ordered,
and not defeated by annoyances imposed by ignorant or indifferent
doctors and attendants.

My commitment occurred on June 11th, 1901. The institution to which I
was committed was a chartered, private institution, but not run for
personal profit. It was considered one of the best of its kind in the
country and was pleasantly situated. Though the view was a restricted
one, a vast expanse of lawn, surrounded by groups of trees, like
patches of primeval forest, gave the place an atmosphere which was not
without its remedial effect. My quarters were comfortable, and after a
little time I adjusted myself to my new environment.

Breakfast was served about half-past seven, though the hour varied
somewhat according to the season--earlier in summer and later in
winter. In the spring, summer, and autumn, when the weather was
favorable, those able to go out of doors were taken after breakfast for
walks within the grounds, or were allowed to roam about the lawn and
sit under the trees, where they remained for an hour or two at a time.
Dinner was usually served shortly after noon, and then the active
patients were again taken out of doors, where they remained an hour or
two doing much as they pleased, but under watchful eyes. About
half-past three they returned to their respective wards, there to
remain until the next day--except those who cared to attend the
religious service which was held almost every afternoon in an endowed
chapel.

In all institutions those confined in different kinds of wards go to
bed at different hours. The patients in the best wards retire at nine
or ten o'clock. Those in the wards where more troublesome cases are
treated go to bed usually at seven or eight o'clock. I, while
undergoing treatment, have retired at all hours, so that I am in the
better position to describe the mysteries of what is, in a way, one of
the greatest secret societies in the world. I soon became accustomed to
the rather agreeable routine, and had I not been burdened with the
delusions which held me a prisoner of the police, and kept me a
stranger to my old world, I should have been able to enjoy a
comparatively happy existence in spite of all.

This new feeling of comparative contentment had not been brought about
by any marked improvement in health. It was due directly and entirely
to an environment more nearly in tune with my ill-tuned mind. While
surrounded by sane people my mental inferiority had been painfully
apparent to me, as well as to others. Here a feeling of superiority
easily asserted itself, for many of my associates were, to my mind,
vastly inferior to myself. But this stimulus did not affect me at once.
For several weeks I believed the institution to be peopled by
detectives, feigning insanity. The government was still operating the
Third Degree, only on a grander scale. Nevertheless, I did soon come to
the conclusion that the institution was what it purported to be--still
cherishing the idea, however, that certain patients and attachés were
detectives.

For a while after my arrival I again abandoned my new-found reading
habit. But as I became accustomed to my surroundings I grew bolder and
resumed the reading of newspapers and such books as were at hand. There
was a bookcase in the ward, filled with old numbers of standard English
periodicals; among them: _Westminster Review, Edinburgh Review, London
Quarterly_, and _Blackwood's_. There were also copies of _Harper's_ and
_The Atlantic Monthly_, dated a generation or more before my first
reading days. Indeed, some of the reviews were over fifty years old.
But I had to read their heavy contents or go without reading, for I
would not yet ask even for a thing I ardently desired. In the room of
one of the patients were thirty or forty books belonging to him. Time
and again I walked by his door and cast longing glances at those books,
which at first I had not the courage to ask for or to take. But during
the summer, about the time I was getting desperate, I finally managed
to summon enough courage to take them surreptitiously. It was usually
while the owner of these books was attending the daily service in the
chapel that his library became a circulating one.

The contents of the books I read made perhaps a deeper impression on my
memory than most books make on the minds of normal readers. To assure
myself of the fact, I have since reread "The Scarlet Letter," and I
recognize it as an old friend. The first part of the story, however,
wherein Hawthorne describes his work as a Custom House official and
portrays his literary personality, seems to have made scarcely any
impression. This I attribute to my utter lack of interest at that time
in writers and their methods. I then had no desire to write a book, nor
any thought of ever doing so.

Letters I looked upon with suspicion. I never read them at the time
they were received. I would not even open them; but generally, after a
week or sometimes a month, I would secretly open and read
them--forgeries of the detectives.

I still refused to speak, and exhibited physical activity only when the
patients were taken out of doors. For hours I would sit reading books
or newspapers, or apparently doing nothing. But my mind was in an
active state and very sensitive. As the event proved, almost everything
done or said within the range of my senses was making indelible
impressions, though these at the time were frequently of such a
character that I experienced great difficulty in trying to recall
incidents which I thought I might find useful at the time of my
appearance in court.

My ankles had not regained anything like their former strength. It hurt
to walk. For months I continued to go flat-footed. I could not sustain
my weight with heels lifted from the floor. In going downstairs I had
to place my insteps on the edge of each step, or go one step at a time,
like a child. Believing that the detectives were pampering me into
prime condition, as a butcher fattens a beast for slaughter, I
deliberately made myself out much weaker than I really was; and not a
little of my inactivity was due to a desire to prolong my fairly
comfortable existence, by deferring as long as possible the day of
trial and conspicuous disgrace.

But each day still had its distressing incidents. Whenever the
attendants were wanted at the office, an electric bell was rung. During
the fourteen months that I remained in this hospital in a depressed
condition, the bell in my ward rang several hundred times. Never did it
fail to send through me a mild shock of terror, for I imagined that at
last the hour had struck for my transportation to the scene of trial.
Relatives and friends would be brought to the ward--heralded, of
course, by a warning bell--and short interviews would be held in my
room, during which the visitors had to do all the talking. My eldest
brother, whom I shall refer to hereafter as my conservator, called
often. He seldom failed to use one phrase which worried me.

"You are looking better and getting stronger," he would say. "We shall
straighten you out yet."

To be "straightened out" was an ambiguous phrase which might refer to
the end of the hangman's rope or to a fatal electric shock.

I preferred to be let alone, and the assistant physician in charge of
my case, after several ineffectual attempts to engage me in
conversation, humored my persistent taciturnity. For more than a year
his only remarks to me were occasional conventional salutations.
Subsequent events have led me to doubt the wisdom of his policy.

For one year no further attention was paid to me than to see that I had
three meals a day, the requisite number of baths, and a sufficient
amount of exercise. I was, however, occasionally urged by an attendant
to write a letter to some relative, but that, of course, I refused to
do. As I shall have many hard things to say about attendants in
general, I take pleasure in testifying that, so long as I remained in a
passive condition, those at this institution were kind, and at times
even thoughtful. But there came a time when diplomatic relations with
doctors and attendants became so strained that war promptly ensued.

It was no doubt upon the gradual, but sure improvement in my physical
condition that the doctors were relying for my eventual return to
normality. They were not without some warrant for this. In a way I had
become less suspicious, but my increased confidence was due as much to
an increasing indifference to my fate as to an improvement in health.
And there were other signs of improved mental vigor. I was still
watchful, however, for a chance to end my life, and, but for a series
of fortunate circumstances, I do not doubt that my choice of evils
would have found tragic expression in an overt act.

Having convinced myself that most of my associates were really insane,
and therefore (as I believed) disqualified as competent witnesses in a
court of law, I would occasionally engage in conversation with a few
whose evident incompetency seemed to make them safe confidants. One, a
man who during his life had more than once been committed to an
institution, took a very evident interest in me and persisted in
talking to me, often much against my will. His persistent
inquisitiveness seemed to support his own statement that he had
formerly been a successful life-insurance agent. He finally gained my
confidence to such a degree that months before I finally began to talk
to others I permitted myself to converse frequently with him--but only
when we were so situated as to escape observation. I would talk to him
on almost any subject, but would not speak about myself. At length,
however, his admirable persistence overcame my reticence. During a
conversation held in June, 1902, he abruptly said, "Why you are kept
here I cannot understand. Apparently you are as sane as anyone. You
have never made any but sensible remarks to me." Now for weeks I had
been waiting for a chance to tell this man my very thoughts. I had come
to believe him a true friend who would not betray me.

"If I should tell you things which you apparently don't know, you would
understand why I am held here," I said.

"Well, tell me," he urged.

"Will you promise not to repeat my statements to any one else?"

"I promise not to say a word."

"Well," I remarked, "you have seen certain persons who have come here,
professing to be relatives of mine."

"Yes, and they are your relatives, aren't they?"

"They look like my relatives, but they're not," was my reply.

My inquisitive friend burst into laughter and said, "Well, if you mean
_that_, I shall have to take back what I just said. You are really the
craziest person I have ever met, and I have met several."

"You will think differently some day," I replied; for I believed that
when my trial should occur, he would appreciate the significance of my
remark. I did not tell him that I believed these callers to be
detectives; nor did I hint that I thought myself in the hands of the
police.

Meanwhile, during July and August, 1902, I redoubled my activity in
devising suicidal schemes; for I now thought my physical condition
satisfactory to my enemies, and was sure that my trial could not be
postponed beyond the next opening of the courts in September. I even
went so far as to talk to one of the attendants, a medical student, who
during the summer worked as an attendant at the hospital. I approached
him artfully. First I asked him to procure from the library for me "The
Scarlet Letter," "The House of the Seven Gables," and other books; then
I talked medicine and finally asked him to lend me a textbook on
anatomy which I knew he had in his possession. This he did, cautioning
me not to let anyone know that he had done so. The book once secured, I
lost no time in examining that part which described the heart, its
functions, and especially its exact position in the body. I had
scarcely begun to read when the young man returned and took the book
from me, giving as his reason that an attendant had no right to let a
patient read a medical work. Maybe his change of heart was
providential.

As is usual in these institutions, all knives, forks, and other
articles that might be used by a patient for a dangerous purpose were
counted by the attendants after each meal. This I knew, and the
knowledge had a deterrent effect. I dared not take one. Though I might
at any time during the night have hanged myself, that method did not
appeal to me, and I kept it in mind only as a last resort. To get
possession of some sharp dagger-like instrument which I could plunge
into my heart at a moment's notice--this was my consuming desire. With
such a weapon I felt that I could, when the crisis came, rob the
detectives of their victory. During the summer months an employé spent
his entire time mowing the lawn with a large horse-drawn machine. This,
when not in use, was often left outdoors. Upon it was a square wooden
box, containing certain necessary tools, among them a sharp, spike-like
instrument, used to clean the oil-holes when they became clogged. This
bit of steel was five or six inches long, and was shaped like a pencil.
For at least three months, I seldom went out of doors that I did not go
with the intention of purloining that steel spike. I intended then to
keep it in my room against the day of my anticipated transfer to jail.

It was now that my delusions protected me from the very fate they had
induced me to court. For had I not believed that the eye of a detective
was on me every moment, I could have taken that spike a score of times.
Often, when it was not in use, I walked to the lawnmower and even laid
my hand upon the tool-box. But I dared not open it. My feelings were
much like those of Pandora about a certain other box. In my case,
however, the box upon which I looked with longing had Hope without, and
not within. Instinctively, perhaps, I realized this, for I did not lift
the lid.

One day, as the patients were returning to their wards, I saw, lying
directly in my path (I could even now point out the spot), the coveted
weapon. Never have I seen anything that I wanted more. To have stooped
and picked it up without detection would have been easy; and had I
known, as I know now, that it had been carelessly dropped there,
nothing could have prevented me from doing so and perhaps using it with
fatal effect. But I believed it had been placed there deliberately and
as a test, by those who had divined my suicidal purpose. The eye of the
imagined detective, which, I am inclined to believe, and like to
believe, was the eye of the real God, was upon me; and though I stepped
directly over it, I did not pick up that thing of death.




XII


When I had decided that my chance for securing the little stiletto spike
was very uncertain, I at once busied myself with plans which were designed
to bring about my death by drowning. There was in the ward a large bath
tub. Access to it could be had at any time, except from the hour of
nine (when the patients were locked in their rooms for the night) until
the following morning. How to reach it during the night was the problem
which confronted me. The attendant in charge was supposed to see that
each patient was in his room before his door was locked. As it rarely
happened that the patients were not in their rooms at the appointed
time, the attendants naturally grew careless, and often locked a door
without looking in. "Good night"--a salutation usually devoid of
sentiment--might, or might not, elicit a response, and the absence of a
response would not tend to arouse suspicion--especially in a case like
mine, for I would sometimes say "good night," but more often not.

My simple and easy plan was to hide behind a piece of furniture in the
corridor and there remain until the attendant had locked the doors of
the rooms and gone to bed. I had even advanced so far in my plan as to
select a convenient nook within twenty feet of my own room. Should the
attendant, when about to lock the door, discover my absence, I should,
of course, immediately reveal my hiding-place by leaving it; and it
would have been an easy matter to convince him that I had done the
thing as a test of his own vigilance. On the other hand, if I escaped
discovery, I should then have nine hours at my disposal with little
fear of interruption. True, the night watch passed through the ward
once every hour. But death by drowning requires a time no longer than
that necessary to boil an egg. I had even calculated how long it would
take to fill the tub with water. To make sure of a fatal result, I had
secreted a piece of wire which I intended so to use that my head, once
under water, could by no possibility be raised above the surface in the
inevitable death struggle.

I have said that I did not desire death; nor did I. Had the supposed
detectives been able to convince me that they would keep their word, I
would willingly have signed an agreement stipulating on my side that I
must live the rest of my life in confinement, and on theirs that I
should never undergo a trial for crime.

Fortunately, during these dismal preparations, I had not lost interest
in other schemes which probably saved my life. In these the
fellow-patient who had won my confidence played the role of my own
private detective. That he and I could defeat the combined forces
arrayed against me hardly seemed probable, but the seeming
impossibility of so doing only lent zest to the undertaking. My friend,
who, of course, did not realize that he was engaged in combat with the
Secret Service, was allowed to go where he pleased within the limits of
the city where the hospital was situated. Accordingly I determined to
enlist his services. It was during July that, at my suggestion, he
tried to procure copies of certain New Haven newspapers, of the date of
my attempted suicide and the several dates immediately following. My
purpose was to learn what motive had been ascribed to my suicidal act.
I felt sure that the papers would contain at least hints as to the
nature of the criminal charges against me. But my purpose I did not
disclose to my friend. In due time he reported that no copies for the
given dates were to be had. So _that_ quest proved fruitless, and I
attributed the failure to the superior strategy of the enemy.

Meanwhile, my friend had not stopped trying to convince me that my
apparent relatives were not spurious; so one day I said to him: "If my
relatives still live in New Haven, their addresses must be in the
latest New Haven Directory. Here is a list containing the names and
former addresses of my father, brother, and uncle. These were their
addresses in 1900. To-morrow, when you go out, please see whether they
appear in the New Haven Directory for 1902. These persons who present
themselves to me as relatives pretend to live at these addresses. If
they speak the truth, the 1902 Directory will corroborate them. I shall
then have hope that a letter sent to any one of these addresses will
reach relatives--and surely some attention will be paid to it."

The next day, my own good detective went to a local publishing house
where directories of important cities throughout the country could be
consulted. Shortly after he went upon this errand, my conservator
appeared. He found me walking about the lawn. At his suggestion we sat
down. Bold in the assurance that I could kill myself before the crisis
came, I talked with him freely, replying to many of his questions and
asking several. My conservator, who did not know that I doubted his
identity, commented with manifest pleasure on my new-found readiness to
talk. He would have been less pleased, however, had he been able to
read my mind.

Shortly after my conservator's departure, my fellow-patient returned
and informed me that the latest New Haven Directory contained the names
and addresses I had given him. This information, though it did not
prove that my morning caller was no detective, did convince me that my
real brother still lived where he did when I left New Haven, two years
earlier. Now that my delusions were growing weaker, my returning reason
enabled me to construct the ingenious scheme which, I believe, saved my
life; for, had I not largely regained my reason _when I did_, I am
inclined to believe that my distraught mind would have destroyed itself
and me, before it could have been restored by the slow process of
returning health.

A few hours after my own private detective had given me the information
I so much desired, I wrote the first letter I had written in twenty-six
months. As letters go, it is in a class by itself. I dared not ask for
ink, so I wrote with a lead pencil. Another fellow-patient in whom I
had confidence, at my request, addressed the envelope; but he was not
in the secret of its contents. This was an added precaution, for I
thought the Secret Service men might have found out that I had a
detective of my own and would confiscate any letters addressed by him
or me. The next morning, _my_ "detective" mailed the letter. That
letter I still have, and I treasure it as any innocent man condemned to
death would treasure a pardon. It should convince the reader that
sometimes a mentally disordered person, even one suffering from many
delusions, can think and write clearly. An exact copy of this--the most
important letter I ever expect to be called upon to write--is here
presented:

    AUGUST 29, 1902.

    DEAR GEORGE:

    On last Wednesday morning a person who claimed to be George M.
    Beers of New Haven, Ct., clerk in the Director's Office of the
    Sheffield Scientific School and a brother of mine, called to see
    me.

    Perhaps what he said was true, but after the events of the last
    two years I find myself inclined to doubt the truth of everything
    that is told me. He said that he would come and see me again
    sometime next week, and I am sending you this letter in order that
    you may bring it with you as a passport, provided you are the one
    who was here on Wednesday.

    If you did not call as stated please say nothing about this letter
    to anyone, and when your double arrives, I'll tell him what I
    think of him. Would send other messages, but while things seem as
    they do at present it is impossible. Have had someone else address
    envelope for fear letter might be held up on the way.

    Yours,

    CLIFFORD W.B.

Though I felt reasonably confident that this message would reach my
brother, I was by no means certain. I was sure, however, that, should
he receive it, under no circumstances would he turn it over to anyone
hostile to myself. When I wrote the words: "Dear George," my feeling
was much like that of a child who sends a letter to Santa Claus after
his childish faith has been shaken. Like the skeptical child, I felt
there was nothing to lose, but everything to gain. "Yours" fully
expressed such affection for relatives as I was then capable of--for
the belief that I had disgraced, perhaps destroyed, my family prompted
me to forbear to use the family name in the signature.

The thought that I might soon get in touch with my old world did not
excite me. I had not much faith anyway that I was to re-establish
former relations with it, and what little faith I had was all but
destroyed on the morning of August 30th, 1902, when a short message,
written on a slip of paper, reached me by the hand of an attendant. It
informed me that my conservator would call that afternoon. I thought it
a lie. I felt that any brother of mine would have taken the pains to
send a letter in reply to the first I had written him in over two
years. The thought that there had not been time for him to do so and
that this message must have arrived by telephone did not then occur to
me. What I believed was that my own letter had been confiscated. I
asked one of the doctors to swear on his honor that it really was my
own brother who was coming to see me. This he did. But abnormal
suspicion robbed all men in my sight of whatever honor they may have
had, and I was not fully reassured.

In the afternoon, as usual, the patients were taken out of doors, I
among them. I wandered about the lawn and cast frequent and expectant
glances toward the gate, through which I believed my anticipated
visitor would soon pass. In less than an hour he appeared. I first
caught sight of him about three hundred feet away, and, impelled more
by curiosity than hope, I advanced to meet him. "I wonder what the lie
will be this time," was the gist of my thoughts.

The person approaching me was indeed the counterpart of my brother as I
remembered him. Yet he was no more my brother than he had been at any
time during the preceding two years. He was still a detective. Such he
was when I shook his hand. As soon as that ceremony was over, he drew
forth a leather pocketbook. I instantly recognized it as one I myself
had carried for several years prior to the time I was taken ill in
1900. It was from this that he took my recent letter.

"Here's my passport," he said.

"It's a good thing you brought it," I replied, as I glanced at it and
again shook his hand--this time the hand of my own brother.

"Don't you want to read it?" he asked.

"There is no need of that. I am convinced."

After my long journey of exploration in the jungle of a tangled
imagination, a journey which finally ended in my finding the person for
whom I had long searched, my behavior differed very little from that of
a great explorer who, full of doubt after a long and perilous trip
through real jungles, found the man he sought and, grasping his hand,
greeted him with the simple and historic words, "Dr. Livingstone, I
presume?"

The very instant I caught sight of my letter in the hands of my
brother, all was changed. The thousands of false impressions recorded
during the seven hundred and ninety-eight days of my depression seemed
at once to correct themselves. Untruth became Truth. A large part of
what was once my old world was again mine. To me, at last my mind
seemed to have found itself, for the gigantic web of false beliefs in
which it had been all but hopelessly enmeshed I now immediately
recognized as a snare of delusions. That the Gordian knot of mental
torture should be cut and swept away by the mere glance of a willing
eye is like a miracle. Not a few patients, however, suffering from
certain forms of mental disorder, regain a high degree of insight into
their mental condition in what might be termed a flash of divine
enlightenment. Though insight regained seemingly in an instant is a
most encouraging symptom, power to reason normally on all subjects
cannot, of course, be so promptly recovered. My new power to reason
correctly on some subjects simply marked the transition from
depression, one phase of my disorder, to elation, another phase of it.
Medically speaking, I was as mentally disordered as before--yet I was
happy!

My memory during depression may be likened to a photographic film,
seven hundred and ninety-eight days long. Each impression seems to have
been made in a negative way and then, in a fraction of a second,
miraculously developed and made positive. Of hundreds of impressions
made during that depressed period I had not before been conscious, but
from the moment my mind, if not my full reason, found itself, they
stood out vividly. Not only so, but other impressions registered during
earlier years became clearer. Since that August 30th, which I regard as
my second birthday (my first was on the 30th of another month), my mind
has exhibited qualities which, prior to that time, were so latent as to
be scarcely distinguishable. As a result, I find myself able to do
desirable things I never before dreamed of doing--the writing of this
book is one of them.

Yet had I failed to convince myself on August 30th, when my brother
came to see me, that he was no spy, I am almost sure that I should have
compassed my own destruction within the following ten days, for the
next month, I believed, was the fatal one of opening courts. You will
recall that it was death by drowning that impended. I liken my
salvation itself to a prolonged process of drowning. Thousands of
minutes of the seven hundred and ninety-eight days--and there were over
one million of them, during which I had been borne down by intolerably
burdensome delusions--were, I imagine, much like the last minutes of
consciousness experienced by persons who drown. Many who have narrowly
escaped that fate can testify to the vividness with which good and bad
impressions of their entire life rush through their confused minds, and
hold them in a grip of terror until a kind unconsciousness envelops
them. Such had been many of my moments. But the only unconsciousness
which had deadened my sensibilities during these two despondent years
was that of sleep itself. Though I slept fairly well most of the time,
mine was seldom a dreamless sleep. Many of my dreams were, if anything,
harder to bear than my delusions of the day, for what little reason I
had was absolutely suspended in sleep. Almost every night my brain was
at battledore and shuttlecock with weird thoughts. And if not all my
dreams were terrifying, this fact seemed to be only because a perverted
and perverse Reason, in order that its possessor might not lose the
capacity for suffering, knew how to keep Hope alive with visions which
supplied the contrast necessary for keen appreciation.

No man can be born again, but I believe I came as near it as ever a man
did. To leave behind what was in reality a hell, and immediately have
this good green earth revealed in more glory than most men ever see it,
was one of the compensating privileges which make me feel that my
suffering was worth while.

I have already described the peculiar sensation which assailed me when,
in June, 1900, I lost my reason. At that time my brain felt as though
pricked by a million needles at white heat. On this August 30th, 1902,
shortly after largely regaining my reason, I had another most distinct
sensation in the brain. It started under my brow and gradually spread
until the entire surface was affected. The throes of a dying Reason had
been torture. The sensations felt as my dead Reason was reborn were
delightful. It seemed as though the refreshing breath of some kind
Goddess of Wisdom were being gently blown against the surface of my
brain. It was a sensation not unlike that produced by a menthol pencil
rubbed ever so gently over a fevered brow. So delicate, so crisp and
exhilarating was it that words fail me in my attempt to describe it.
Few, if any, experiences can be more delightful. If the exaltation
produced by some drugs is anything like it, I can easily understand how
and why certain pernicious habits enslave those who contract them. For
me, however, this experience was liberation, not enslavement.




XIII


After two years of silence I found it no easy matter to carry on with
my brother a sustained conversation. So weak were my vocal cords from
lack of use that every few minutes I must either rest or whisper. And
upon pursing my lips I found myself unable to whistle, notwithstanding
the popular belief, drawn from vague memories of small-boyhood, that
this art is instinctive. Those who all their lives have talked at will
cannot possibly appreciate the enjoyment I found in using my regained
power of speech. Reluctantly I returned to the ward; but not until my
brother had left for home, laden with so much of my conversation that
it took most of his leisure for the next two days to tell the family
what I had said in two hours.

During the first few hours I seemed virtually normal. I had none of the
delusions which had previously oppressed me; nor had I yet developed
any of the expansive ideas, or delusions of grandeur, which soon began
to crowd in upon me. So normal did I appear while talking to my brother
that he thought I should be able to return home in a few weeks; and,
needless to say, I agreed with him. But the pendulum, as it were, had
swung too far. The human brain is too complex a mechanism to admit of
any such complete readjustment in an instant. It is said to be composed
of several million cells; and, that fact granted, it seems safe to say
that every day, perhaps every hour, hundreds of thousands of the cells
of my brain were now being brought into a state of renewed activity.
Comparatively sane and able to recognize the important truths of life,
I was yet insane as to many of its practical details. Judgment being
King of the Realm of Thought, it was not surprising that my judgment
failed often to decide correctly the many questions presented to it by
its abnormally communicative subjects. At first I seemed to live a
second childhood. I did with delight many things which I had first
learned to do as a child--the more so as it had been necessary for me
to learn again to eat and walk, and now to talk. I had much lost time
to make up; and for a while my sole ambition seemed to be to utter as
many thousand words a day as possible. My fellow-patients who for
fourteen months had seen me walk about in silence--a silence so
profound and inexorable that I would seldom heed their friendly
salutations--were naturally surprised to see me in my new mood of
unrestrained loquacity and irrepressible good humor. In short, I had
come into that abnormal condition which is known to psychiatrists as
elation.

For several weeks I believe I did not sleep more than two or three
hours a night. Such was my state of elation, however, that all signs of
fatigue were entirely absent and the sustained and abnormal mental and
physical activity in which I then indulged has left on my memory no
other than a series of very pleasant impressions. Though based on
fancy, the delights of some forms of mental disorder are real. Few, if
any, sane persons would care to test the matter at so great a price;
but those familiar with the "Letters of Charles Lamb" must know that
Lamb, himself, underwent treatment for mental disease. In a letter to
Coleridge, dated June 10th, 1796, he says: "At some future time I will
amuse you with an account, as full as my memory will permit, of the
strange turns my frenzy took. I look back upon it at times with a
gloomy kind of envy; for, while it lasted, I had many, many hours of
pure happiness. Dream not, Coleridge, of having tasted all the grandeur
and wildness of Fancy till you have gone mad! All now seems to me
vapid, comparatively so!"

As for me, the very first night vast but vague humanitarian projects
began joyously to shape themselves in my mind. My garden of thoughts
seemed filled with flowers which might properly be likened to the
quick-blowing night-blooming cereus--that Delusion of Grandeur of all
flowering plants that thinks itself prodigal enough if it but unmask
its beauty to the moon! Few of my bold fancies, however, were of so
fugitive and chaste a splendor.

The religious instinct is found in primitive man. It is not strange,
therefore, that at this time the religious side of my nature was the
first to display compelling activity. Whether or not this was due to my
rescue from a living death, and my immediate appreciation of God's
goodness, both to me and to those faithful relatives who had done all
the praying during the preceding two years--this I cannot say. But the
fact stands out, that, whereas I had, while depressed, attached a
sinister significance to everything done or said in my presence, I now
interpreted the most trifling incidents as messages from God. The day
after this transition I attended church. It was the first service in
over two years which I had not attended against my will. The reading of
a psalm--the 45th--made a lasting impression upon me, and the
interpretation which I placed upon it furnishes the key to my attitude
during the first weeks of elation. It seemed to me a direct message
from Heaven.

The minister began: "My heart is inditing a good matter: I speak of the
things which I have made touching the king: my tongue is the pen of a
ready writer."--Whose heart but mine? And the things indited--what were
they but the humanitarian projects which had blossomed in my garden of
thoughts over night? When, a few days later, I found myself writing
very long letters with unwonted facility, I became convinced that my
tongue was to prove itself "the pen of a ready writer." Indeed, to
these prophetic words I trace the inception of an irresistible desire,
of which this book is the first fruit.

"Thou art fairer than the children of men; grace is poured into thy
lips:" was the verse next read (by myself and the congregation), to
which the minister responded, "Therefore God hath blessed thee for
ever."--"Surely, I have been selected as the instrument wherewith great
reforms shall be effected," was my thought. (All is grist that comes to
the mill of a mind in elation--then even divine encomiums seem not
undeserved.)

"Gird thy sword upon thy thigh, O most mighty, with thy glory and thy
majesty"--a command to fight. "And in thy majesty ride prosperously
because of truth and meekness and righteousness;" replied the minister.
"And thy right hand shall teach thee terrible things,"--was another
response. That I could speak the truth, I knew. "Meekness" I could not
associate with myself, except that during the preceding two years I had
suffered many indignities without open resentment. That my right hand
with a pen should teach me terrible things--how to fight for reform--I
firmly believed.

"Thine arrows are sharp in the heart of the King's enemies, whereby the
people fall under thee," quoth the minister. Yes, my tongue could be as
sharp as an arrow, and I should be able to stand up against those who
should stand in the way of reform. Again: "Thou lovest righteousness,
and hatest wickedness. Therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with
the oil of gladness above thy fellows." The first sentence I did not
apply to myself; but being then, as I supposed, a man restored to
himself, it was easy to feel that I had been anointed with the oil of
gladness above my fellows. "Oil of gladness" is, in truth, an apt
phrase wherewith to describe elation.

The last two verses of the psalm corroborated the messages found in the
preceding verses: "I will make thy name to be remembered in all
generations:"--thus the minister. "Therefore shall the people praise
thee for ever and ever," was the response I read. That spelled immortal
fame for me, but only on condition that I should carry to a successful
conclusion the mission of reform--an obligation placed upon me by God
when He restored my reason.

When I set out upon a career of reform, I was impelled to do so by
motives in part like those which seem to have possessed Don Quixote
when he set forth, as Cervantes says, with the intention "of righting
every kind of wrong, and exposing himself to peril and danger, from
which in the issue he would obtain eternal renown and fame." In
likening myself to Cervantes' mad hero my purpose is quite other than
to push myself within the charmed circle of the chivalrous. What I wish
to do is to make plain that a man abnormally elated may be swayed
irresistably by his best instincts, and that while under the spell of
an exaltation, idealistic in degree, he may not only be willing, but
eager to assume risks and endure hardships which under normal
conditions he would assume reluctantly, if at all. In justice to
myself, however, I may remark that my plans for reform have never
assumed quixotic, and therefore, impracticable proportions. At no time
have I gone a-tilting at windmills. A pen rather than a lance has been
my weapon of offence and defence; for with its point I have felt sure
that I should one day prick the civic conscience into a compassionate
activity, and thus bring into a neglected field earnest men and women
who should act as champions for those afflicted thousands least able to
fight for themselves.




XIV


After being without relatives and friends for over two years I
naturally lost no time in trying again to get in touch with them;
though I did heed my conservator's request that I first give him two or
three days in which to acquaint intimates with the new turn my affairs
had taken.

During the latter part of that first week I wrote many letters, so
many, indeed, that I soon exhausted a liberal supply of stationery.
This had been placed at my disposal at the suggestion of my
conservator, who had wisely arranged that I should have whatever I
wanted, if expedient. It was now at my own suggestion that the
supervisor gave me large sheets of manila wrapping paper. These I
proceeded to cut into strips a foot wide. One such strip, four feet
long, would suffice for a mere _billet-doux_; but a real letter usually
required several such strips pasted together. More than once letters
twenty or thirty feet long were written; and on one occasion the
accumulation of two or three days of excessive productivity, when
spread upon the floor, reached from one end of the corridor to the
other--a distance of about one hundred feet. My hourly output was
something like twelve feet, with an average of one hundred and fifty
words to the foot. Under the pressure of elation one takes pride in
doing everything in record time. Despite my speed my letters were not
incoherent. They were simply digressive, which was to be expected, as
elation befogs one's "goal idea." Though these epistolary monstrosities
were launched, few reached those to whom they were addressed; for my
conservator had wisely ordered that my literary output be sent in bulk
to him. His action was exasperating, but later I realized that he had
done me a great favor when he interposed his judgment between my
red-hot mentality and the cool minds of the workaday world. Yet this
interference with what I deemed my rights proved to be the first step
in the general overruling of them by tactless attendants and, in
particular, by a certain assistant physician.

I had always shown a strong inclination to superintend. In consequence,
in my elated condition it was but natural that I should have an excess
of executive impulses. In order to decrease this executive pressure I
proceeded to assume entire charge of that portion of the hospital in
which I happened at the moment to be confined. What I eventually issued
as imperative orders were often presented at first as polite
suggestions. But, if my suggestions were not accorded a respectful
hearing, and my demands acted upon at once, I invariably supplemented
them with vituperative ultimatums. These were double-edged, and
involved me in trouble quite as often as they gained the ends I sought.

The assistant physician in charge of my case, realizing that he could
not grant all of my requests, unwisely decided to deny most of them.
Had he been tactful, he could have taken the same stand without
arousing my animosity. As it was, he treated me with a contemptuous
sort of indifference which finally developed into spite, and led to
much trouble for us both. During the two wild months that followed, the
superintendent and the steward could induce me to do almost anything by
simply requesting it. If two men out of three could control me easily
during such a period of mental excitement, is it not reasonable to
suppose that the third man, the assistant physician, could likewise
have controlled me had he treated me with consideration? It was his
undisguised superciliousness that gave birth to my contempt for him. In
a letter written during my second week of elation, I expressed the
opinion that he and I should get along well together. But that was
before I had become troublesome enough to try the man's patience.
Nevertheless, it indicates that he could have saved himself hours of
time and subsequent worry, had he met my friendly advances in the
proper spirit, for it is the quality of heart quite as much as the
quantity of mind that cures or makes happy the insane.

The literary impulse took such a hold on me that, when I first sat down
to compose a letter, I bluntly refused to stop writing and go to bed
when the attendant ordered me to do so. For over one year this man had
seen me mute and meek, and the sudden and startling change from passive
obedience to uncompromising independence naturally puzzled him. He
threatened to drag me to my room, but strangely enough decided not to
do so. After half an hour's futile coaxing, during which time an
unwonted supply of blood was drawn to his brain, that surprised organ
proved its gratitude by giving birth to a timely and sensible idea.
With an unaccustomed resourcefulness, by cutting off the supply of
light at the electric switch, he put the entire ward in darkness.
Secretly I admired the stratagem, but my words on that occasion
probably conveyed no idea of the approbation that lurked within me.

I then went to bed, but not to sleep. The ecstasy of elation made each
conscious hour one of rapturous happiness, and my memory knows no day
of brighter sunlight than those nights. The floodgates of thought wide
open. So jealous of each other were the thoughts that they seemed to
stumble over one another in their mad rush to present themselves to my
re-enthroned ego.

I naturally craved companionship, but there were not many patients whom
I cared to talk with. I did, however, greatly desire to engage the
assistant physician in conversation, as he was a man of some education
and familiar with the history of my case. But this man, who had tried
to induce me to speak when delusions had tied my tongue, now, when I
was at last willing talk, would scarcely condescend to listen; and what
seemed to me his studied and ill-disguised avoidance only served to
whet my desire to detain him whenever possible.

It was about the second week that my reformative turn of mind became
acute. The ward in which I was confined was well furnished and as
homelike as such a place could be, though in justice to my own home I
must observe that the resemblance was not great. About the so-called
violent ward I had far less favorable ideas. Though I had not been
subjected to physical abuse during the first fourteen months of my stay
here, I had seen unnecessary and often brutal force used by the
attendants in managing several so-called violent patients, who, upon
their arrival, had been placed in the ward where I was. I had also
heard convincing rumors of rough treatment of irresponsible patients in
the violent ward.

At once I determined to conduct a thorough investigation of the
institution. In order that I might have proof that my intended action
was deliberate, my first move was to tell one or two fellow-patients
that I should soon transgress some rule in such a way as to necessitate
my removal to the violent ward. At first I thought of breaking a few
panes of glass; but my purpose was accomplished in another way--and,
indeed, sooner than I had anticipated. My conservator, in my presence,
had told the assistant physician that the doctors could permit me to
telephone him whenever they should see fit. It was rather with the wish
to test the unfriendly physician than to satisfy any desire to speak
with my conservator that one morning I asked permission to call up the
latter. That very morning I had received a letter from him. This the
doctor knew, for I showed him the letter--but not its contents. It was
on the letter that I based my demand, though in it my brother did not
even intimate that he wished to speak to me. The doctor, however, had
no way of knowing that my statement was not true. To deny my request
was simply one of his ill-advised whims, and his refusal was given with
customary curtness and contempt. I met his refusal in kind, and
presented him with a trenchant critique of his character.

He said, "Unless you stop talking in that way I shall have you
transferred to the Fourth Ward." (This was the violent ward.)

"Put me where you please," was my reply. "I'll put you in the gutter
before I get through with you."

With that the doctor made good his threat, and the attendant escorted
me to the violent ward--a willing, in fact, eager prisoner.

The ward in which I was now placed (September 13th, 1902) was furnished
in the plainest manner. The floors were of hard wood and the walls were
bare. Except when at meals or out of doors taking their accustomed
exercise, the patients usually lounged about in one large room, in
which heavy benches were used, it being thought that in the hands of
violent patients, chairs might become a menace to others. In the dining
room, however, there were chairs of a substantial type, for patients
seldom run amuck at meal time. Nevertheless, one of these dining-room
chairs soon acquired a history.

As my banishment had come on short notice, I had failed to provide
myself with many things I now desired. My first request was that I be
supplied with stationery. The attendants, acting no doubt on the
doctor's orders, refused to grant my request; nor would they give me a
lead pencil--which, luckily, I did not need, for I happened to have
one. Despite their refusal I managed to get some scraps of paper, on
which I was soon busily engaged in writing notes to those in authority.
Some of these (as I learned later) were delivered, but no attention was
paid to them. No doctor came near me until evening, when the one who
had banished me made his regular round of inspection. When he appeared,
the interrupted conversation of the morning was resumed--that is, by
me--and in a similar vein. I again asked leave to telephone my
conservator. The doctor again refused, and, of course, again I told him
what I thought of him.

My imprisonment pleased me. I was where I most wished to be, and I
busied myself investigating conditions and making mental notes. As the
assistant physician could grant favors to the attendants, and had
authority to discharge them, they did his bidding and continued to
refuse most of my requests. In spite of their unfriendly attitude,
however, I did manage to persuade the supervisor, a kindly man, well
along in years, to deliver a note to the steward. In it I asked him to
come at once, as I wished to talk with him. The steward, whom I looked
upon as a friend, returned no answer and made no visit. I supposed he,
too, had purposely ignored me. As I learned afterwards, both he and the
superintendent were absent, else perhaps I should have been treated in
a less high-handed manner by the assistant physician, who was not
absent.

The next morning, after a renewal of my request and a repeated refusal,
I asked the doctor to send me the "Book of Psalms" which I had left in
my former room. With this request he complied, believing, perhaps, that
some religion would at least do me no harm. I probably read my favorite
psalm, the 45th; but most of my time I spent writing, on the flyleaves,
psalms of my own. And if the value of a psalm is to be measured by the
intensity of feeling portrayed, my compositions of that day rightly
belonged beside the writings of David. My psalms were indited to those
in authority at the hospital, and later in the day the supervisor--who
proved himself a friend on many occasions--took the book to
headquarters.

The assistant physician, who had mistaken my malevolent tongue for a
violent mind, had placed me in an exile which precluded my attending
the service which was held in the chapel that Sunday afternoon. Time
which might better have been spent in church I therefore spent in
perfecting a somewhat ingenious scheme for getting in touch with the
steward. That evening, when the doctor again appeared, I approached him
in a friendly way and politely repeated my request. He again refused to
grant it. With an air of resignation I said, "Well, as it seems useless
to argue the point with you and as the notes sent to others have thus
far been ignored, I should like, with your kind permission, to kick a
hole in your damned old building and to-morrow present myself to the
steward in his office."

"Kick away!" he said with a sneer. He then entered an adjoining ward,
where he remained for about ten minutes.

If you will draw in your mind, or on paper, a letter "L," and let the
vertical part represent a room forty feet in length, and the horizontal
part one of twenty, and if you will then picture me as standing in a
doorway at the intersection of these two lines--the door to the dining
room--and the doctor behind another door at the top of the
perpendicular, forty feet away, you will have represented graphically
the opposing armies just prior to the first real assault in what proved
to be a siege of seven weeks.

The moment the doctor re-entered the ward, as he had to do to return to
the office, I disappeared through my door--into the dining room. I then
walked the length of that room and picked up one of the heavy wooden
chairs, selected for my purpose while the doctor and his tame charges
were at church. Using the chair as a battering-ram, without malice--joy
being in my heart--I deliberately thrust two of its legs through an
upper and a lower pane of a four-paned plate glass window. The only
miscalculation I made was in failing to place myself directly in front
of that window, and at a proper distance, so that I might have broken
every one of the four panes. This was a source of regret to me, for I
was always loath to leave a well-thought-out piece of work unfinished.

The crash of shattered and falling glass startled every one but me.
Especially did it frighten one patient who happened to be in the dining
room at the time. He fled. The doctor and the attendant who were in the
adjoining room could not see me, or know what the trouble was; but they
lost no time in finding out. Like the proverbial cold-blooded murderer
who stands over his victim, weapon in hand, calmly awaiting arrest, I
stood my ground, and, with a fair degree of composure, awaited the
onrush of doctor and attendant. They soon had me in hand. Each taking
an arm, they marched me to my room. This took not more than half a
minute, but the time was not so short as to prevent my delivering
myself of one more thumb-nail characterization of the doctor. My
inability to recall that delineation, verbatim, entails no loss on
literature. But one remark made as the doctor seized hold of me was
apt, though not impromptu. "Well, doctor," I said, "knowing you to be a
truthful man, I just took you at your word."

Senseless as this act appears it was the result of logical thinking.
The steward had entire charge of the building and ordered all necessary
repairs. It was he whom I desired above all others to see, and I
reasoned that the breaking of several dollars' worth of plate glass
(for which later, to my surprise, I had to pay) would compel his
attention on grounds of economy, if not those of the friendly interest
which I now believed he had abandoned. Early the next morning, as I had
hoped, the steward appeared. He approached me in a friendly way (as had
been his wont) and I met him in a like manner. "I wish you would leave
a little bit of the building," he said good-naturedly.

"I will leave it all, and gladly, if you will pay some attention to my
messages," was my rejoinder.

"Had I not been out of town," he replied, "I would have come to see you
sooner." And this honest explanation I accepted.

I made known to the steward the assistant physician's behavior in
balking my desire to telephone my conservator. He agreed to place the
matter before the superintendent, who had that morning returned. As
proof of gratitude, I promised to suspend hostilities until I had had a
talk with the superintendent. I made it quite plain, however, that
should he fail to keep his word, I would further facilitate the
ventilation of the violent ward. My faith in mankind was not yet wholly
restored.




XV


A few hours later, without having witnessed anything of particular
significance, except as it befell myself, I was transferred to my old
ward. The superintendent, who had ordered this rehabilitation, soon
appeared, and he and I had a satisfactory talk. He gave me to
understand that he himself would in future look after my case, as he
realized that his assistant lacked the requisite tact and judgment to
cope with one of my temperament--and with that, my desire to telephone
my conservator vanished.

Now no physician would like to have his wings clipped by a patient,
even indirectly, and without doubt the man's pride was piqued as his
incompetence was thus made plain. Thereafter, when he passed through
the ward, he and I had frequent tilts. Not only did I lose no
opportunity to belittle him in the presence of attendants and patients,
but I even created such opportunities; so that before long he tried to
avoid me whenever possible. But it seldom was possible. One of my chief
amusements consisted in what were really one-sided interviews with him.
Occasionally he was so unwise as to stand his ground for several
minutes, and his arguments on such occasions served only to keep my
temper at a vituperative heat. If there were any epithets which I
failed to apply to him during the succeeding weeks of my association
with him, they must have been coined since. The uncanny admixture of
sanity displayed by me, despite my insane condition, was something this
doctor could not comprehend. Remarks of mine, which he should have
discounted or ignored, rankled as the insults of a sane and free man
would have done. And his blunt and indiscriminate refusal of most of my
requests prolonged my period of mental excitement.

After my return to my old ward I remained there for a period of three
weeks. At that time I was a very self-centred individual. My large and
varied assortment of delusions of grandeur made everything seem
possible. There were few problems I hesitated to attack. With
sufficient provocation I even attacked attendants--problems in
themselves; but such fights as I subsequently engaged in were fights
either for my own rights or the rights of others. Though for a while I
got along fairly well with the attendants and as well as could be
expected with the assistant physician, it soon became evident that
these men felt that to know me more was to love me less. Owing to their
lack of capacity for the work required of them, I was able to cause
them endless annoyance. Many times a day I would tell the attendants
what to do and what not to do, and tell them what I should do if my
requests, suggestions, or orders were not immediately complied with.
For over one year they had seen me in a passive, almost speechless
condition, and they were, therefore, unable to understand my unwonted
aggressions. The threat that I would chastise them for any disobedience
of my orders they looked upon as a huge joke. So it was, until one day
I incontinently cracked that joke against the head of one of them.

It began in this wise: Early in October there was placed in the ward a
man whose abnormality for the most part consisted of an inordinate
thirst for liquor. He was over fifty years of age, well educated,
traveled, refined and of an artistic temperament. Congenial companions
were scarce where I was, and he and I were soon drawn together in
friendship. This man had been trapped into the institution by the
subterfuge of relatives. As is common in such cases, many "white" lies
had been resorted to in order to save trouble for all concerned--that
is, all except the patient. To be taken without notice from one's home
and by a deceitful, though under the circumstances perhaps justifiable
strategy, placed in a ward with fifteen other men, all exhibiting
insanity in varying degrees, is as heartbreaking an ordeal as one can
well imagine. Yet such was this man's experience. A free man one day,
he found himself deprived of his liberty the next, and branded with
what he considered an unbearable disgrace.

Mr. Blank (as I shall call him) was completely unnerved. As he was a
stranger in what I well knew was a strange world, I took him under my
protecting and commodious wing. I did all I could to cheer him up, and
tried to secure for him that consideration which to me seemed
indispensable to his well-being. Patients in his condition had never
been forced, when taking their exercise, to walk about the grounds with
the other patients. At no time during the preceding fourteen months had
I seen a newly committed patient forced to exercise against his will.
One who objected was invariably left in the ward, or his refusal was
reported to the doctor before further action was taken. No sane person
need stretch his imagination in order to realize how humiliating it
would be for this man to walk with a crowd which greatly resembled a
"chain gang." Two by two, under guard, these hostages of misfortune get
the only long walks their restricted liberty allows them. After the one
or two occasions when this man did walk with the gang, I was impressed
with the not wholly unreasonable thought that the physical exercise in
no way compensated for the mental distress which the sense of
humiliation and disgrace caused him to suffer. It was delightfully easy
for me to interfere in his behalf; and when he came to my room, wrought
up over the prospect of another such humiliation and weeping bitterly,
I assured him that he should take his exercise that day when I did. My
first move to accomplish the desired result was to approach, in a
friendly way, the attendant in charge, and ask him to permit my new
friend to walk about the grounds with me when next I went. He said he
would do nothing of the kind--that he intended to take this man when he
took the others. I said, "For over a year I have been in this ward and
so have you, and I have never yet seen a man in Mr. Blank's condition
forced to go out of doors."

"It makes no difference whether you have or not," said the attendant,
"he's going."

"Will you ask the doctor whether Mr. Blank can or cannot walk about the
grounds with my special attendant when I go?"

"No, I won't. Furthermore, it's none of your business."

"If you resort to physical force and attempt to take Mr. Blank with the
other patients, you'll wish you hadn't," I said, as I walked away.

At this threat the fellow scornfully laughed. To him it meant nothing.
He believed I could fight only with my tongue, and I confess that I
myself was in doubt as to my power of fighting otherwise.

Returning to my room, where Mr. Blank was in waiting, I supported his
drooping courage and again assured him that he should be spared the
dreaded ordeal. I ordered him to go to a certain room at the farther
end of the hall and there await developments--so that, should there be
a fight, the line of battle might be a long one. He obeyed. In a minute
or two the attendant was headed for that room. I followed closely at
his heels, still threatening to attack him if he dared so much as lay a
finger on my friend. Though I was not then aware of it, I was followed
by another patient, a man who, though a mental case, had his lucid
intervals and always a loyal heart. He seemed to realize that trouble
was brewing and that very likely I should need help. Once in the room,
the war of words was renewed, my sensitive and unnerved friend standing
by and anxiously looking on.

"I warn you once more," I said, "if you touch Mr. Blank, I'll punch you
so hard you'll wish you hadn't." The attendant's answer was an
immediate attempt to eject Mr. Blank from the room by force. Nothing
could be more automatic than my action at that time; indeed, to this
day I do not remember performing the act itself. What I remember is the
determination to perform it and the subsequent evidence of its having
been performed. At all events I had already made up my mind to do a
certain thing if the attendant did a certain thing. He did the one and
I did the other. Almost before he had touched Mr. Blank's person, my
right fist struck him with great force in, on, or about the left eye.
It was then that I became the object of the attendant's attention--but
not his undivided attention--for as he was choking me, my unsuspected
ally stepped up and paid the attendant a sincere compliment by likewise
choking him. In the scuffle I was forced to the floor. The attendant
had a grip upon my throat. My wardmate had a double grip upon the
attendant's throat. Thus was formed a chain with a weak, if not a
missing, link in the middle. Picture, if you will, an insane man being
choked by a supposedly sane one, and he in turn being choked by a
temporarily sane insane friend of the assaulted one, and you will have
Nemesis as nearly in a nutshell as any mere rhetorician has yet been
able to put her.

That I was well choked is proved by the fact that my throat bore the
crescent-shaped mark of my assailant's thumb nail. And I am inclined to
believe that my rescuer, who was a very powerful man, made a decided
impression on my assailant's throat. Had not the superintendent
opportunely appeared at that moment, the man might soon have lapsed
into unconsciousness, for I am sure my ally would never have released
him until he had released me. The moment the attendant with his one
good eye caught sight of the superintendent the scrimmage ended. This
was but natural, for it is against the code of honor generally
obtaining among attendants, that one should so far forget himself as to
abuse patients in the presence of sane and competent witnesses.

The choking which I had just received served only to limber my vocal
cords. I told the doctor all about the preliminary verbal skirmish and
the needlessness of the fight. The superintendent had graduated at Yale
over fifty years prior to my own graduation, and because of this common
interest and his consummate tact we got along well together. But his
friendly interest did not keep him from speaking his mind upon
occasion, as his words at this time proved. "You don't know," he said,
"how it grieves me to see you--a Yale man--act so like a rowdy."

"If fighting for the rights of a much older man, unable to protect his
own interests, is the act of a rowdy, I'm quite willing to be thought
one," was my reply.

Need I add that the attendant did not take Mr. Blank for a walk that
morning? Nor, so far as I know, was the latter ever forced again to
take his exercise against his will.




XVI


The superintendent now realized that I was altogether too energetic a
humanitarian to remain in a ward with so many other patients. My
actions had a demoralizing effect upon them; so I was forthwith
transferred to a private room, one of two situated in a small one-story
annex. These new quarters were rather attractive, not unlike a bachelor
apartment.

As there was no one here with whom I could interfere I got along
without making any disturbance--that is, so long as I had a certain
special attendant, a man suited to my temperament. He who was now
placed over me understood human nature. He never resorted to force if
argument failed to move me; and trifling transgressions, which would
have led to a fight had he behaved like a typical attendant, he either
ignored or privately reported to the doctor. For the whole period of my
intense excitement there were certain persons who could control me, and
certain others whose presence threw me into a state bordering on rage,
and frequently into passions which led to distressing results.

Unfortunately for me, my good attendant soon left the institution to
accept a more attractive business offer. He left without even a
good-bye to me. Nothing proves more conclusively how important to me
would have been his retention than this abrupt leave-taking which the
doctor had evidently ordered, thinking perhaps that the prospect of
such a change would excite me. However, I caused no trouble when the
substitution was made, though I did dislike having placed over me a man
with whom I had previously had misunderstandings. He was about my own
age and it was by no means so easy to take orders from him as it had
been to obey his predecessor, who was considerably older than myself.
Then, too, this younger attendant disliked me because of the many
disagreeable things I had said to him while we were together in a
general ward. He weighed about one hundred and ninety pounds to my one
hundred and thirty, and had evidently been selected to attend me
because of his great strength. A choice based on mental rather than
physical considerations would have been wiser. The superintendent,
because of his advanced age and ill health, had been obliged again to
place my case in the hands of the assistant physician, and the latter
gave this new attendant certain orders. What I was to be permitted to
do, and what not, was carefully specified. These orders, many of them
unreasonable, were carried out to the letter. For this I cannot justly
blame the attendant. The doctor had deprived him of the right to
exercise what judgment he had.

At this period I required but little sleep. I usually spent part of the
night drawing; for it was in September, 1902, while I was at the height
of my wave of self-centred confidence, that I decided that I was
destined to become a writer of books--or at least of one book; and now
I thought I might as well be an artist, too, and illustrate my own
works. In school I had never cared for drawing; nor at college either.
But now my awakened artistic impulse was irresistible. My first
self-imposed lesson was a free-hand copy of an illustration on a cover
of _Life_. Considering the circumstances, that first drawing was
creditable, though I cannot now prove the assertion; for inconsiderate
attendants destroyed it, with many more of my drawings and manuscripts.
From the very moment I completed that first drawing, honors were
divided between my literary and artistic impulses; and a letter which,
in due time, I felt impelled to write to the Governor of the State,
incorporated art with literature. I wrote and read several hours a day
and I spent as many more in drawing. But the assistant physician,
instead of making it easy for me to rid myself of an excess of energy
along literary and artistic lines, balked me at every turn, and seemed
to delight in displaying as little interest as possible in my newly
awakened ambitions. When everything should have been done to calm my
abnormally active mind, a studied indifference and failure to protect
my interests kept me in a state of exasperation.

But circumstances now arose which brought about the untimely
stifling--I might better say strangulation--of my artistic impulses.
The doctors were led--unwisely, I believe--to decide that absolute
seclusion was the only thing that would calm my over-active brain. In
consequence, all writing and drawing materials and all books were taken
from me. And from October 18th until the first of the following
January, except for one fortnight, I was confined in one or another
small, barred room, hardly better than a cell in a prison and in some
instances far worse.

A corn cob was the determining factor at this crisis. Seeing in myself
an embryonic Raphael, I had a habit of preserving all kinds of odds and
ends as souvenirs of my development. These, I believed, sanctified by
my Midas-like touch, would one day be of great value. If the public can
tolerate, as it does, thousands of souvenir hunters, surely one with a
sick mind should be indulged in the whim for collecting such souvenirs
as come within his reach. Among the odds and ends that I had gathered
were several corn cobs. These I intended to gild and some day make
useful by attaching to them small thermometers. But on the morning of
October 18th, the young man in charge of me, finding the corn cobs,
forthwith informed me that he would throw them away. I as promptly
informed him that any such action on his part would lead to a fight.
And so it did.

When this fight began, there were two attendants at hand. I fought them
both to a standstill, and told them I should continue to fight until
the assistant physician came to the ward. Thereupon, my special
attendant, realizing that I meant what I said, held me while the other
went for assistance. He soon returned, not with the assistant
physician, but with a third attendant, and the fight was renewed. The
one who had acted as messenger, being of finer fibre than the other
two, stood at a safe distance. It was, of course, against the rules of
the institution for an attendant to strike a patient, and, as I was
sane enough to report with a fair chance of belief any forbidden blows,
each captor had to content himself with holding me by an arm and
attempting to choke me into submission. However, I was able to prevent
them from getting a good grip on my throat, and for almost ten minutes
I continued to fight, telling them all the time that I would not stop
until a doctor should come. An assistant physician, but not the one in
charge of my case, finally appeared. He gave orders that I be placed in
the violent ward, which adjoined the private apartment I was then
occupying, and no time was lost in locking me in a small room in that
ward.

Friends have said to me: "Well, what is to be done when a patient runs
amuck?" The best answer I can make is: "Do nothing to make him run
amuck." Psychiatrists have since told me that had I had an attendant
with the wisdom and ability to humor me and permit me to keep my
priceless corn cobs, the fight in question, and the worse events that
followed, would probably not have occurred--not that day, nor ever, had
I at all times been properly treated by those in charge of me.

So again I found myself in the violent ward--but this time not because
of any desire to investigate it. Art and literature being now more
engrossing than my plans for reform, I became, in truth, an unwilling
occupant of a room and a ward devoid of even a suggestion of the
aesthetic. The room itself was clean, and under other circumstances
might have been cheerful. It was twelve feet long, seven feet wide, and
twelve high. A cluster of incandescent lights, enclosed in a
semi-spherical glass globe, was attached to the ceiling. The walls were
bare and plainly wainscotted, and one large window, barred outside,
gave light. At one side of the door was an opening a foot square with a
door of its own which could be unlocked only from without, and through
which food could be passed to a supposedly dangerous patient. Aside
from a single bed, the legs of which were screwed to the floor, the
room had no furniture.

The attendant, before locking me in, searched me and took from me
several lead pencils; but the stub of one escaped his vigilance.
Naturally, to be taken from a handsomely furnished apartment and thrust
into such a bare and unattractive room as this caused my already heated
blood to approach the boiling point. Consequently, my first act was to
send a note to the physician who regularly had charge of my case,
requesting him to visit me as soon as he should arrive, and I have
every reason to believe that the note was delivered. Whether or not
this was so, a report of the morning's fight and my transfer must have
reached him by some one of several witnesses. While waiting for an
answer, I busied myself writing, and as I had no stationery I wrote on
the walls. Beginning as high as I could reach, I wrote in columns, each
about three feet wide. Soon the pencil became dull. But dull pencils
are easily sharpened on the whetstone of wit. Stifling acquired traits,
I permitted myself to revert momentarily to a primitive expedient. I
gnawed the wood quite from the pencil, leaving only the graphite core.
With a bit of graphite a hand guided by the unerring insolence of
elation may artistically damn all men and things. That I am inclined to
believe I did; and I question whether Raphael or Michael Angelo--upon
whom I then looked as mere predecessors--ever put more feeling per
square foot into their mural masterpieces. Every little while, as if to
punctuate my composition, and in an endeavor to get attention, I
viciously kicked the door.

This first fight of the day occurred about 8 A.M. For the three hours
following I was left to thrash about the room and work myself into a
frenzy. I made up my mind to compel attention. A month earlier,
shattered glass had enabled me to accomplish a certain sane purpose.
Again this day it served me. The opalescent half-globe on the ceiling
seemed to be the most vulnerable point for attack. How to reach and
smash it was the next question--and soon answered. Taking off my shoes,
I threw one with great force at my glass target and succeeded in
striking it a destructive blow.

The attendants charged upon my room. Their entrance was momentarily
delayed by the door which stuck fast. I was standing near it, and when
it gave way, its edge struck me on the forehead with force enough to
have fractured my skull had it struck a weaker part. Once in the room,
the two attendants threw me on the bed and one choked me so severely
that I could feel my eyes starting from their sockets. The attendants
then put the room in order; removed the glass--that is, all except one
small and apparently innocent, but as the event proved well-nigh fatal,
piece--took my shoes and again locked me in my room--not forgetting,
however, to curse me well for making them work for their living.

When the assistant physician finally appeared, I met him with a blast
of invective which, in view of the events which quickly followed, must
have blown out whatever spark of kindly feeling toward me he may ever
have had. I demanded that he permit me to send word to my conservator
asking him to come at once and look after my interests, for I was being
unfairly treated. I also demanded that he request the superintendent to
visit me at once, as I intended to have nothing more to do with the
assistant physicians or attendants who were neglecting and abusing me.
He granted neither demand.

The bit of glass which the attendants had overlooked was about the size
of my thumb nail. If I remember rightly, it was not a part of the
broken globe. It was a piece that had probably been hidden by a former
occupant, in a corner of the square opening at the side of the door. At
all events, if the pen is the tongue of a ready writer, so may a piece
of glass be, under given conditions. As the thought I had in mind
seemed an immortal one I decided to etch, rather than write with
fugitive graphite. On the topmost panel of the door, which a few
minutes before had dealt me so vicious a blow, I scratched a seven-word
sentiment--sincere, if not classic: "God bless our Home, which is
Hell."

The violent exercise of the morning had given me a good appetite and I
ate my dinner with relish, though with some difficulty, for the choking
had lamed my throat. On serving this dinner, the attendants again left
me to my own devices. The early part of the afternoon I spent in vain
endeavors to summon them and induce them to take notes to the
superintendent and his assistant. They continued to ignore me. By
sundown the furious excitement of the morning had given place to what
might be called a deliberative excitement, which, if anything, was more
effective. It was but a few days earlier that I had discussed my case
with the assistant physician and told him all about the suicidal
impulse which had been so strong during my entire period of depression.
I now reasoned that a seeming attempt at suicide, a "fake" suicide,
would frighten the attendants into calling this doctor whose presence I
now desired--and desired the more because of his studied indifference.
No man that ever lived, loved life more than I did on that day, and the
mock tragedy which I successfully staged about dusk was, I believe, as
good a farce as was ever perpetrated. If I had any one ambition it was
to live long enough to regain my freedom and put behind prison bars
this doctor and his burly henchmen. To compel attention that was my
object.

At that season the sun set by half-past five and supper was usually
served about that time. So dark was my room then that objects in it
could scarcely be discerned. About a quarter of an hour before the
attendant was due to appear with my evening meal I made my
preparations. That the stage setting might be in keeping with the plot,
I tore up such papers as I had with me, and also destroyed other
articles in the room--as one might in a frenzy; and to complete the
illusion of desperation, deliberately broke my watch. I then took off
my suspenders, and tying one end to the head of the bedstead, made a
noose of the other. This I adjusted comfortably about my throat. At the
crucial moment I placed my pillow on the floor beside the head of the
bed and sat on it--for this was to be an easy death. I then bore just
enough weight on the improvised noose to give all a plausible look. And
a last lifelike (or rather deathlike) touch I added by gurgling as in
infancy's happy days.

No schoolboy ever enjoyed a prank more than I enjoyed this one. Soon I
heard the step of the attendant, bringing my supper. When he opened the
door, he had no idea that anything unusual was happening within. Coming
as he did from a well-lighted room into one that was dark, it took him
several seconds to grasp the situation--and then he failed really to
take it in, for he at once supposed me to be in a semi-unconscious
condition from strangulation. In a state of great excitement this brute
of the morning called to his brute partner and I was soon released from
what was nothing more than an amusing position, though they believed it
one of torture or death. The vile curses with which they had addressed
me in the morning were now silenced. They spoke kindly and expressed
regret that I should have seen fit to resort to such an act. Their
sympathy was as genuine as such men can feel, but a poor kind at best,
for it was undoubtedly excited by the thought of what might be the
consequences to them of their own neglect. While this unwonted stress
of emotion threatened their peace of mind, I continued to play my part,
pretending to be all but unconscious.

Shortly after my rescue from a very living death, the attendants picked
me up and carried my limp body and laughing soul to an adjoining room,
where I was tenderly placed upon a bed. I seemed gradually to revive.

"What did you do it for?" asked one.

"What's the use of living in a place like this, to be abused as I've
been to-day?" I asked. "You and the doctor ignore me and all my
requests. Even a cup of water between meals is denied me, and other
requests which you have no right to refuse. Had I killed myself, both
of you would have been discharged. And if my relatives and friends had
ever found out how you had abused and neglected me, it is likely you
would have been arrested and prosecuted."

Word had already been sent to the physician. He hurried to the ward,
his almost breathless condition showing how my farce had been mistaken
for a real tragedy. The moment he entered I abandoned the part I had
been playing.

"Now that I have you three brutes where I want you, I'll tell you a few
things you don't know," I said. "You probably think I've just tried to
kill myself. It was simply a ruse to make you give me some attention.
When I make threats and tell you that my one object in life is to live
long enough to regain my freedom and lay bare the abuses which abound
in places like this, you simply laugh at me, don't you? But the fact
is, that's my ambition, and if you knew anything at all, you'd know
that abuse won't drive me to suicide. You can continue to abuse me and
deprive me of my rights, and keep me in exile from relatives and
friends, but the time will come when I'll make you sweat for all this.
I'll put you in prison where you belong. Or if I fail to do that, I can
at least bring about your discharge from this institution. What's more,
I will."

The doctor and attendants took my threats with characteristic
nonchalance. Such threats, often enough heard in such places, make
little or no impression, for they are seldom made good. When I made
these threats, I really wished to put these men in prison. To-day I
have no such desire, for were they not victims of the same vicious
system of treatment to which I was subjected? In every institution
where the discredited principles of "Restraint" are used or tolerated,
the very atmosphere is brutalizing. Place a bludgeon in the hand of any
man, with instructions to use it when necessary, and the gentler and
more humane methods of persuasion will naturally be forgotten or
deliberately abandoned.

Throughout my period of elation, especially the first months of it when
I was doing the work of several normal men, I required an increased
amount of fuel to generate the abnormal energy my activity demanded. I
had a voracious appetite, and I insisted that the attendant give me the
supper he was about to serve when he discovered me in the simulated
throes of death. At first he refused, but finally relented and brought
me a cup of tea and some buttered bread. Because of the severe choking
administered earlier in the day it was with difficulty that I swallowed
any food. I _had_ to eat slowly. The attendant, however, ordered me to
hurry, and threatened otherwise to take what little supper I had. I
told him that I thought he would not--that I was entitled to my supper
and intended to eat it with as much comfort as possible. This nettled
him, and by a sudden and unexpected move he managed to take from me all
but a crust of bread. Even that he tried to snatch. I resisted and the
third fight of the day was soon on--and that within five minutes of the
time the doctor had left the ward. I was seated on the bed. The
attendant, true to his vicious instincts, grasped my throat and choked
me with the full power of a hand accustomed to that unmanly work. His
partner, in the meantime, had rendered me helpless by holding me flat
on my back while the attacking party choked me into breathless
submission. The first fight of the day was caused by a corn cob; this
of the evening by a crust of bread.

Were I to close the record of events of that October day with an
account of the assault just described, few, if any, would imagine that
I had failed to mention all the abuse to which I was that day
subjected. The fact is that not the half has been told. As the handling
of me within the twenty-four hours typifies the worst, but,
nevertheless, the not unusual treatment of many patients in a like
condition, I feel constrained to describe minutely the torture which
was my portion that night.

There are several methods of restraint in use to this day in various
institutions, chief among them "mechanical restraint" and so-called
"chemical restraint." The former consists in the use of instruments of
restraint, namely, strait-jackets or camisoles, muffs, straps, mittens,
restraint or strong sheets, etc.--all of them, except on the rarest of
occasions, instruments of neglect and torture. Chemical restraint
(sometimes called medical restraint) consists in the use of temporarily
paralyzing drugs--hyoscine being the popular "dose." By the use of such
drugs a troublesome patient may be rendered unconscious and kept so for
hours at a time. Indeed, very troublesome patients (especially when
attendants are scarce) are not infrequently kept in a stupefied
condition for days, or even for weeks--but only in institutions where
the welfare of the patients is lightly regarded.

After the supper fight I was left alone in my room for about an hour.
Then the assistant physician entered with three attendants, including
the two who had figured in my farce. One carried a canvas contrivance
known as a camisole. A camisole is a type of straitjacket; and a very
convenient type it is for those who resort to such methods of
restraint, for it enables them to deny the use of strait-jackets at
all. A strait-jacket, indeed, is not a camisole, just as electrocution
is not hanging.

A camisole, or, as I prefer to stigmatize it, a straitjacket, is really
a tight-fitting coat of heavy canvas, reaching from neck to waist,
constructed, however, on no ordinary pattern. There is not a button on
it. The sleeves are closed at the ends, and the jacket, having no
opening in front, is adjusted and tightly laced behind. To the end of
each blind sleeve is attached a strong cord. The cord on the right
sleeve is carried to the left of the body, and the cord on the left
sleeve is carried to the right of the body. Both are then drawn tightly
behind, thus bringing the arms of the victim into a folded position
across his chest. These cords are then securely tied.

When I planned my ruse of the afternoon, I knew perfectly that I should
soon find myself in a strait-jacket. The thought rather took my fancy,
for I was resolved to know the inner workings of the violent ward.

The piece of glass with which I had that morning written the motto
already quoted, I had appropriated for a purpose. Knowing that I should
soon be put in the uncomfortable, but not necessarily intolerable
embrace of a strait-jacket, my thought was that I might during the
night, in some way or other, use this piece of glass to
advantage--perhaps cut my way to a limited freedom. To make sure that I
should retain possession of it, I placed it in my mouth and held it
snugly against my cheek. Its presence there did not interfere with my
speech; nor did it invite visual detection. But had I known as much
about strait-jackets and their adjustment as I learned later, I should
have resorted to no such futile expedient.

After many nights of torture, this jacket, at my urgent and repeated
request, was finally adjusted in such manner that, had it been so
adjusted at first, I need not have suffered any _torture_ at all. This
I knew at the time, for I had not failed to discuss the matter with a
patient who on several occasions had been restrained in this same
jacket.

On this occasion the element of personal spite entered into the
assistant physician's treatment of me. The man's personality was
apparently dual. His "Jekyll" personality was the one most in evidence,
but it was the "Hyde" personality that seemed to control his actions
when a crisis arose. It was "Doctor Jekyll" who approached my room that
night, accompanied by the attendants. The moment he entered my room he
became "Mr. Hyde." He was, indeed, no longer a doctor, or the semblance
of one. His first move was to take the straitjacket in his own hands
and order me to stand. Knowing that those in authority really believed
I had that day attempted to kill myself, I found no fault with their
wish to put me in restraint; but I did object to having this done by
Jekyll-Hyde. Though a straitjacket should always be adjusted by the
physician in charge, I knew that as a matter of fact the disagreeable
duty was invariably assigned to the attendants. Consequently
Jekyll-Hyde's eagerness to assume an obligation he usually shirked gave
me the feeling that his motives were spiteful. For that reason I
preferred to entrust myself to the uncertain mercies of a regular
attendant; and I said so, but in vain. "If you will keep your mouth
shut, I'll be able to do this job quicker," said Jekyll-Hyde.

"I'll shut my mouth as soon as you get out of this room and not
before," I remarked. Nor did I. My abusive language was, of course,
interlarded with the inevitable epithets. The more I talked, the more
vindictive he became. He said nothing, but, unhappily for me, he
expressed his pent-up feelings in something more effectual than words.
After he had laced the jacket, and drawn my arms across my chest so
snugly that I could not move them a fraction of an inch, I asked him to
loosen the strait-jacket enough to enable me at least to take a full
breath. I also requested him to give me a chance to adjust my fingers,
which had been caught in an unnatural and uncomfortable position.

"If you will keep still a minute, I will," said Jekyll-Hyde. I obeyed,
and willingly too, for I did not care to suffer more than was
necessary. Instead of loosening the appliance as agreed, this doctor,
now livid with rage, drew the cords in such a way that I found myself
more securely and cruelly held than before. This breach of faith threw
me into a frenzy. Though it was because his continued presence served
to increase my excitement that Jekyll-Hyde at last withdrew, it will be
observed that he did not do so until he had satisfied an unmanly desire
which an apparently lurking hatred had engendered. The attendants soon
withdrew and locked me up for the night.

No incidents of my life have ever impressed themselves more indelibly
on my memory than those of my first night in a strait-jacket. Within
one hour of the time I was placed in it I was suffering pain as intense
as any I ever endured, and before the night had passed it had become
almost unbearable. My right hand was so held that the tip of one of my
fingers was all but cut by the nail of another, and soon knifelike
pains began to shoot through my right arm as far as the shoulder. After
four or five hours the excess of pain rendered me partially insensible
to it. But for fifteen consecutive hours I remained in that instrument
of torture; and not until the twelfth hour, about breakfast time the
next morning, did an attendant so much as loosen a cord.

During the first seven or eight hours, excruciating pains racked not
only my arms, but half of my body. Though I cried and moaned, in fact,
screamed so loudly that the attendants must have heard me, little
attention was paid to me--possibly because of orders from Mr. Hyde
after he had again assumed the role of Doctor Jekyll. I even begged the
attendants to loosen the jacket enough to ease me a little. This they
refused to do, and they even seemed to enjoy being in a position to add
their considerable mite to my torture.

Before midnight I really believed that I should be unable to endure the
torture and retain my reason. A peculiar pricking sensation which I now
felt in my brain, a sensation exactly like that of June, 1900, led me
to believe that I might again be thrown out of touch with the world I
had so lately regained. Realizing the awfulness of that fate, I
redoubled my efforts to effect my rescue. Shortly after midnight I did
succeed in gaining the attention of the night watch. Upon entering my
room he found me flat on the floor. I had fallen from the bed and
perforce remained absolutely helpless where I lay. I could not so much
as lift my head. This, however, was not the fault of the straitjacket.
It was because I could not control the muscles of my neck which that
day had been so mauled. I could scarcely swallow the water the night
watch was good enough to give me. He was not a bad sort; yet even he
refused to let out the cords of the strait-jacket. As he seemed
sympathetic, I can attribute his refusal to nothing but strict orders
issued by the doctor.

It will be recalled that I placed a piece of glass in my mouth before
the strait-jacket was adjusted. At midnight the glass was still there.
After the refusal of the night watch, I said to him: "Then I want you
to go to Doctor Jekyll" (I, of course, called him by his right name;
but to do so now would be to prove myself as brutal as Mr. Hyde
himself). "Tell him to come here at once and loosen this jacket. I
can't endure the torture much longer. After fighting two years to
regain my reason, I believe I'll lose it again. You have always treated
me kindly. For God's sake, get the doctor!"

"I can't leave the main building at this time," the night watch said.
(Jekyll-Hyde lived in a house about one-eighth of a mile distant, but
within the hospital grounds.)

"Then will you take a message to the assistant physician who stays
here?" (A colleague of Jekyll-Hyde had apartments in the main
building.)

"I'll do that," he replied.

"Tell him how I'm suffering. Ask him to please come here at once and
ease this strait-jacket. If he doesn't, I'll be as crazy by morning as
I ever was. Also tell him I'll kill myself unless he comes, and I can
do it, too. I have a piece of glass in this room and I know just what
I'll do with it."

The night watch was as good as his word. He afterwards told me that he
had delivered my message. The doctor ignored it. He did not come near
me that night, nor the next day, nor did Jekyll-Hyde appear until his
usual round of inspection about eleven o'clock the next morning.

"I understand that you have a piece of glass which you threatened to
use for a suicidal purpose last night," he said, when he appeared.

"Yes, I have, and it's not your fault or the other doctor's that I am
not dead. Had I gone mad, in my frenzy I might have swallowed that
glass."

"Where is it?" asked the doctor, incredulously.

As my strait-jacket rendered me armless, I presented the glass to
Jekyll-Hyde on the tip of a tongue he had often heard, but never before
seen.




XVII


After fifteen interminable hours the strait-jacket was removed. Whereas
just prior to its putting on I had been in a vigorous enough condition
to offer stout resistance when wantonly assaulted, now, on coming out
of it, I was helpless. When my arms were released from their
constricted position, the pain was intense. Every joint had been
racked. I had no control over the fingers of either hand, and could not
have dressed myself had I been promised my freedom for doing so.

For more than the following week I suffered as already described,
though of course with gradually decreasing intensity as my racked body
became accustomed to the unnatural positions it was forced to take.
This first experience occurred on the night of October 18th, 1902. I
was subjected to the same unfair, unnecessary, and unscientific ordeal
for twenty-one consecutive nights and parts of each of the
corresponding twenty-one days. On more than one occasion, indeed, the
attendant placed me in the strait-jacket during the day for refusing to
obey some trivial command. This, too, without an explicit order from
the doctor in charge, though perhaps he acted under a general order.

During most of this time I was held also in seclusion in a padded cell.
A padded cell is a vile hole. The side walls are padded as high as a
man can reach, as is also the inside of the door. One of the worst
features of such cells is the lack of ventilation, which deficiency of
course aggravates their general unsanitary condition. The cell which I
was forced to occupy was practically without heat, and as winter was
coming on, I suffered intensely from the cold. Frequently it was so
cold I could see my breath. Though my canvas jacket served to protect
part of that body which it was at the same time racking, I was seldom
comfortably warm; for, once uncovered, my arms being pinioned, I had no
way of rearranging the blankets. What little sleep I managed to get I
took lying on a hard mattress placed on the bare floor. The condition
of the mattress I found in the cell was such that I objected to its
further use, and the fact that another was supplied, at a time when few
of my requests were being granted, proves its disgusting condition.

For this period of three weeks--from October 18th until November 8th,
1902, when I left this institution and was transferred to a state
hospital--I was continuously either under lock and key (in the padded
cell or some other room) or under the eye of an attendant. Over half
the time I was in the snug, but cruel embrace of a strait-jacket--about
three hundred hours in all.

While being subjected to this terrific abuse I was held in exile. I was
cut off from all direct and all _honest_ indirect communication with my
legally appointed conservator--my own brother--and also with all other
relatives and friends. I was even cut off from satisfactory
communication with the superintendent. I saw him but twice, and then
for so short a time that I was unable to give him any convincing idea
of my plight. These interviews occurred on two Sundays that fell within
my period of exile, for it was on Sunday that the superintendent
usually made his weekly round of inspection.

What chance had I of successfully pleading my case, while my pulpit was
a padded cell, and the congregation--with the exception of the
superintendent--the very ones who had been abusing me? At such times my
pent-up indignation poured itself forth in such a disconnected way that
my protests were robbed of their right ring of truth. I was not
incoherent in speech. I was simply voluble and digressive--a natural
incident of elation. Such notes as I managed to write on scraps of
paper were presumably confiscated by Jekyll-Hyde. At all events, it was
not until some months later that the superintendent was informed of my
treatment, when, at my request (though I was then elsewhere), the
Governor of the State discussed the subject with him. How I brought
about that discussion while still virtually a prisoner in another place
will be narrated in due time. And not until several days after I had
left this institution and had been placed in another, when for the
first time in six weeks I saw my conservator, did _he_ learn of the
treatment to which I had been subjected. From his office in New Haven
he had telephoned several times to the assistant physician and inquired
about my condition. Though Jekyll-Hyde did tell him that I was highly
excited and difficult to control, he did not even hint that I was being
subjected to any unusual restraint. Doctor Jekyll deceived everyone,
and--as things turned out--deceived himself; for had he realized then
that I should one day be able to do what I have since done, his
brutality would surely have been held in check by his discretion.

How helpless, how at the mercy of his keepers, a patient may be is
further illustrated by the conduct of this same man. Once, during the
third week of my nights in a strait-jacket, I refused to take certain
medicine which an attendant offered me. For some time I had been
regularly taking this innocuous concoction without protest; but I now
decided that, as the attendant refused most of my requests, I should no
longer comply with all of his. He did not argue the point with me. He
simply reported my refusal to Doctor Jekyll. A few minutes later Doctor
Jekyll--or rather Mr. Hyde--accompanied by three attendants, entered
the padded cell. I was robed for the night--in a strait-jacket. Mr.
Hyde held in his hand a rubber tube. An attendant stood near with the
medicine. For over two years, the common threat had been made that the
"tube" would be resorted to if I refused medicine or food. I had begun
to look upon it as a myth; but its presence in the hands of an
oppressor now convinced me of its reality. I saw that the doctor and
his bravos meant business; and as I had already endured torture enough,
I determined to make every concession this time and escape what seemed
to be in store for me.

"What are you going to do with that?" I asked, eyeing the tube.

"The attendant says you refuse to take your medicine. We are going to
make you take it."

"I'll take your old medicine," was my reply.

"You have had your chance."

"All right," I said. "Put that medicine into me any way you think best.
But the time will come when you'll wish you hadn't. When that time does
come it won't be easy to prove that you had the right to force a
patient to take medicine he had offered to take. I know something about
the ethics of your profession. You have no right to do anything to a
patient except what's good for him. You know that. All you are trying
to do is to punish me, and I give you fair warning I'm going to camp on
your trail till you are not only discharged from this institution, but
expelled from the State Medical Society as well. You are a disgrace to
your profession, and that society will attend to your case fast enough
when certain members of it, who are friends of mine, hear about this.
Furthermore, I shall report your conduct to the Governor of the State.
He can take some action even if this is _not_ a state institution. Now,
damn you, do your worst!"

Coming from one in my condition, this was rather straight talk. The
doctor was visibly disconcerted. Had he not feared to lose caste with
the attendants who stood by, I think he would have given me another
chance. But he had too much pride and too little manhood to recede from
a false position already taken. I no longer resisted, even verbally,
for I no longer wanted the doctor to desist. Though I did not
anticipate the operation with pleasure, I was eager to take the man's
measure. He and the attendants knew that I usually kept a trick or two
even up the sleeve of a strait-jacket, so they took added precautions.
I was flat on my back, with simply a mattress between me and the floor.
One attendant held me. Another stood by with the medicine and with a
funnel through which, as soon as Mr. Hyde should insert the tube in one
of my nostrils, the dose was to be poured. The third attendant stood
near as a reserve force. Though the insertion of the tube, when
skilfully done, need not cause suffering, the operation as conducted by
Mr. Hyde was painful. Try as he would, he was unable to insert the tube
properly, though in no way did I attempt to balk him. His embarrassment
seemed to rob his hand of whatever cunning it may have possessed. After
what seemed ten minutes of bungling, though it was probably not half
that, he gave up the attempt, but not until my nose had begun to bleed.
He was plainly chagrined when he and his bravos retired. Intuitively I
felt that they would soon return. That they did, armed with a new
implement of war. This time the doctor inserted between my teeth a
large wooden peg--to keep open a mouth which he usually wanted shut. He
then forced down my throat a rubber tube, the attendant adjusted the
funnel, and the medicine, or rather liquid--for its medicinal
properties were without effect upon me--was poured in.

As the scant reports sent to my conservator during these three weeks
indicated that I was not improving as he had hoped, he made a special
trip to the institution, to investigate in person. On his arrival he
was met by none other than Doctor Jekyll, who told him that I was in a
highly excited condition, which, he intimated, would be aggravated by a
personal interview. Now for a man to see his brother in such a plight
as mine would be a distressing ordeal, and, though my conservator came
within a few hundred feet of my prison cell, it naturally took but a
suggestion to dissuade him from coming nearer. Doctor Jekyll did tell
him that it had been found necessary to place me in "restraint" and
"seclusion" (the professional euphemisms for "strait-jacket," "padded
cell," etc.), but no hint was given that I had been roughly handled.
Doctor Jekyll's politic dissuasion was no doubt inspired by the
knowledge that if ever I got within speaking distance of my
conservator, nothing could prevent my giving him a circumstantial
account of my sufferings--which account would have been corroborated by
the blackened eye I happened to have at the time. Indeed, in dealing
with my conservator the assistant physician showed a degree of tact
which, had it been directed toward myself, would have sufficed to keep
me tolerably comfortable.

My conservator, though temporarily stayed, was not convinced. He felt
that I was not improving where I was, and he wisely decided that the
best course would be to have me transferred to a public
institution--the State Hospital. A few days later the judge who had
originally committed me ordered my transfer. Nothing was said to me
about the proposed change until the moment of departure, and then I
could scarcely believe my ears. In fact I did not believe my informant;
for three weeks of abuse, together with my continued inability to get
in touch with my conservator, had so shaken my reason that there was a
partial recurrence of old delusions. I imagined myself on the way to
the State Prison, a few miles distant; and not until the train had
passed the prison station did I believe that I was really on my way to
the State Hospital.




XVIII


The State Hospital in which I now found myself, the third institution
to which I had been committed, though in many respects above the
average of such institutions, was typical. It commanded a wide view of
a beautiful river and valley. This view I was permitted to enjoy--at
first. Those in charge of the institution which I had just left did not
give my new custodians any detailed account of my case. Their reticence
was, I believe, occasioned by chagrin rather than charity. Tamers of
wild men have as much pride as tamers of wild animals (but
unfortunately less skill) and to admit defeat is a thing not to be
thought of. Though private institutions are prone to shift their
troublesome cases to state institutions, there is too often a
deplorable lack of sympathy and co-operation between them, which, in
this instance, however, proved fortunate for me.

From October 18th until the early afternoon of November 8th, at the
private institution, I had been classed as a raving maniac. The _name_
I had brought upon myself by experimental conduct; the _condition_ had
been aggravated and perpetuated by the stupidity of those in authority
over me. And it was the same experimental conduct on my part, and
stupidity on the part of my new custodians, which gave rise, two weeks
later, to a similar situation. On Friday, November 7th, I was in a
strait-jacket. On November 9th and 10th I was apparently as tractable
as any of the twenty-three hundred patients in the State
Hospital--conventionally clothed, mild mannered, and, seemingly, right
minded. On the 9th, the day after my arrival, I attended a church
service held at the hospital. My behavior was not other than that of
the most pious worshipper in the land. The next evening, with most
exemplary deportment, I attended one of the dances which are held every
fortnight during the winter. Had I been a raving maniac, such
activities would have led to a disturbance; for maniacs, of necessity,
disregard the conventions of both pious and polite society. Yet, on
either of these days, had I been in the private institution which I had
recently left, I should have occupied a cell and worn a strait-jacket.

The assistant superintendent, who received me upon my arrival, judged
me by my behavior. He assigned me to one of two connecting wards--the
best in the hospital--where about seventy patients led a fairly
agreeable life. Though no official account of my case had accompanied
my transfer, the attendant who had acted as escort and guard had
already given an attendant at the State Hospital a brief account of my
recent experiences. Yet when this report finally reached the ears of
those in authority, they wisely decided not to transfer me to another
ward so long as I caused no trouble where I was. Finding myself at last
among friends, I lost no time in asking for writing and drawing
materials, which had so rudely been taken from me three weeks earlier.
My request was promptly granted. The doctors and attendants treated me
kindly and I again began to enjoy life. My desire to write and draw had
not abated. However, I did not devote my entire time to those pursuits,
for there were plenty of congenial companions about. I found pleasure
in talking--more pleasure by far than others did in listening. In fact
I talked incessantly, and soon made known, in a general way, my scheme
for reforming institutions, not only in my native State, but, of
course, throughout the world, for my grandiose perspective made the
earth look small. The attendants had to bear the brunt of my loquacity,
and they soon grew weary. One of them, wishing to induce silence,
ventured to remark that I was so "crazy" I could not possibly keep my
mouth shut for even one minute. It was a challenge which aroused my
fighting spirit.

"I'll show you that I can stop talking for a whole day," I said. He
laughed, knowing that of all difficult tasks this which I had imposed
upon myself was, for one in my condition, least likely of
accomplishment. But I was as good as my boast. Until the same hour the
next day I refused to speak to anyone. I did not even reply to civil
questions; and, though my silence was deliberate and good-natured, the
assistant physician seemed to consider it of a contumacious variety,
for he threatened to transfer me to a less desirable ward unless I
should again begin to talk.

That day of self-imposed silence was about the longest I have ever
lived, for I was under a word pressure sufficient to have filled a
book. Any psychiatrist will admit that my performance was remarkable,
and he will further agree that it was, at least, an indication of a
high degree of self-control. Though I have no desire to prove that at
this period I was not in an abnormal condition, I do wish to show that
I had a degree of self-control that probably would have enabled me to
remain in the best ward at this institution had I not been intent
--abnormally intent, of course, and yet with a high degree of
deliberation--upon a reformative investigation. The crest of my wave of
elation had been reached early in October. It was now (November) that
the curve representing my return to normality should have been
continuous and diminishing. Instead, it was kept violently
fluctuating--or at least its fluctuations were aggravated--by the
impositions of those in charge of me, induced sometimes, I freely
admit, by deliberate and purposeful transgressions of my own. My
condition during my three weeks of exile just ended, had been, if
anything, one of milder excitement than that which had obtained
previously during the first seven weeks of my period of elation. And my
condition during the two weeks I now remained in the best ward in the
State Hospital was not different from my condition during the preceding
three weeks of torture, or the succeeding three weeks of abuse and
privation, except in so far as a difference was occasioned by the
torture and privation themselves.

Though I had long intended to effect reforms in existing methods of
treatment, my reckless desire to investigate violent wards did not
possess me until I myself had experienced the torture of continued
confinement in one such ward before coming to this state institution.
It was simple to deduce that if one could suffer such abuses as I had
while a patient in a private institution--nay, in two private
institutions--brutality must exist in a state hospital also. Thus it
was that I entered the State Hospital with a firm resolve to inspect
personally every type of ward, good and bad.

But I was in no hurry to begin. My recent experience had exhausted me,
and I wished to regain strength before subjecting myself to another
such ordeal. This desire to recuperate controlled my conduct for a
while, but its influence gradually diminished as life became more and
more monotonous. I soon found the good ward entirely too polite. I
craved excitement--action. And I determined to get it regardless of
consequences; though I am free to confess I should not have had the
courage to proceed with my plan had I known what was in store for me.

About this time my conservator called to see me. Of course, I told him
all about my cruel experiences at the private institution. My account
surprised and distressed him. I also told him that I knew for a fact
that similar conditions existed at the State Hospital, as I had heard
convincing rumors to that effect. He urged me to behave myself and
remain in the ward where I was, which ward, as I admitted, was all that
one could desire--provided one had schooled himself to desire that sort
of thing.

The fact that I was under lock and key and behind what were virtually
prison bars in no way gave me a sense of helplessness. I firmly
believed that I should find it easy to effect my escape and reach home
for the Thanksgiving Day celebration. And, furthermore, I knew that,
should I reach home, I should not be denied my portion of the good
things to eat before being returned to the hospital. Being under the
spell of an intense desire to investigate the violent ward, I concluded
that the time for action had come. I reasoned, too, that it would be
easier and safer to escape from that ward--which was on a level with
the ground--than from a ward three stories above it. The next thing I
did was to inform the attendants (not to mention several of the
patients) that within a day or two I should do something to cause my
removal to it. They of course did not believe that I had any idea of
deliberately inviting such a transfer. My very frankness disarmed them.

On the evening of November 21st, I went from room to room collecting
all sorts of odds and ends belonging to other patients. These I
secreted in my room. I also collected a small library of books,
magazines and newspapers. After securing all the booty I dared, I
mingled with the other patients until the time came for going to bed.
The attendants soon locked me in my junk shop and I spent the rest of
the night setting it in disorder. My original plan had been to
barricade the door during the night, and thus hold the doctors and
attendants at bay until those in authority had accepted my ultimatum,
which was to include a Thanksgiving visit at home. But before morning I
had slightly altered my plan. My sleepless night of activity had made
me ravenously hungry, and I decided that it would be wiser not only to
fill my stomach, but to lay by other supplies of food before submitting
to a siege. Accordingly I set things to rights and went about my
business the next morning as usual. At breakfast I ate enough for two
men, and put in my pockets bread enough to last for twenty-four hours
at least. Then I returned to my room and at once barricaded the door.
My barricade consisted of a wardrobe, several drawers which I had
removed from the bureau, and a number of books--among them "Paradise
Lost" and the Bible. These, with conscious satisfaction, I placed in
position as a keystone. Thus the floor space between the door and the
opposite wall of the room was completely filled. My roommate, a young
fellow in the speechless condition in which I had been during my period
of depression, was in the room with me. This was accidental. It was no
part of my plan to hold him as a hostage, though I might finally have
used him as a pawn in the negotiations, had my barricade resisted the
impending attack longer than it did.

It was not long before the attendants realized that something was
wrong. They came to my door and asked me to open it. I refused, and
told them that to argue the point would be a waste of time. They tried
to force an entrance. Failing in that, they reported to the assistant
physician, who soon appeared. At first he parleyed with me. I
good-naturedly, but emphatically, told him that I could not be talked
out of the position I had taken; nor could I be taken out of it until I
was ready to surrender, for my barricade was one that would surely
hold. I also announced that I had carefully planned my line of action
and knew what I was about. I complimented him on his hitherto tactful
treatment of me, and grandiloquently--yet sincerely--thanked him for
his many courtesies. I also expressed entire satisfaction with the past
conduct of the attendants. In fact, on part of the institution I put
the stamp of my approval. "But," I said, "I know there are wards in
this hospital where helpless patients are brutally treated; and I
intend to put a stop to these abuses at once. Not until the Governor of
the State, the judge who committed me, and my conservator come to this
door will I open it. When they arrive, we'll see whether or not
patients are to be robbed of their rights and abused."

My speech was made through a screen transom over the door. For a few
minutes the doctor continued his persuasive methods, but that he should
even imagine that I would basely recede from my high and mighty
position only irritated me the more.

"You can stand outside that door all day if you choose," I said. "I
won't open it until the three men I have named appear. I have prepared
for a siege; and I have enough food in this room to keep me going for a
day anyway."

Realizing at last that no argument would move me, he set about forcing
an entrance. First he tried to remove the transom by striking it with a
stout stick. I gave blow for blow and the transom remained in place. A
carpenter was then sent for, but before he could go about his work one
of the attendants managed to open the door enough to thrust in his arm
and shove aside my barricade. I did not realize what was being done
until it was too late to interfere. The door once open, in rushed the
doctor and four attendants. Without ceremony I was thrown upon the bed,
with two or three of the attacking force on top of me. Again I was
choked, this time by the doctor. The operation was a matter of only a
moment. But before it was over I had the good fortune to deal the
doctor a stinging blow on the jaw, for which (as he was about my own
age and the odds were five to one) I have never felt called upon to
apologize.

Once I was subdued, each of the four attendants attached himself to a
leg or an arm and, under the direction and leadership of the doctor, I
was carried bodily through two corridors, down two flights of stairs,
and to the violent ward. My dramatic exit startled my fellow-patients,
for so much action in so short a time is seldom seen in a quiet ward.
And few patients placed in the violent ward are introduced with so
impressive an array of camp-followers as I had that day.

All this to me was a huge joke, with a good purpose behind it. Though
excited I was good-natured and, on the way to my new quarters, I said
to the doctor: "Whether you believe it or not, it's a fact that I'm
going to reform these institutions before I'm done. I raised this
rumpus to make you transfer me to the violent ward. What I want you to
do now is to show me the worst you've got."

"You needn't worry," the doctor said. "You'll get it."

He spoke the truth.




XIX


Even for a violent ward my entrance was spectacular--if not dramatic.
The three attendants regularly in charge naturally jumped to the
conclusion that, in me, a troublesome patient had been foisted upon
them. They noted my arrival with an unpleasant curiosity, which in turn
aroused _my_ curiosity, for it took but a glance to convince me that my
burly keepers were typical attendants of the brute-force type. Acting
on the order of the doctor in charge, one of them stripped me of my
outer garments; and, clad in nothing but underclothes, I was thrust
into a cell.

Few, if any, prisons in this country contain worse holes than this cell
proved to be. It was one of five, situated in a short corridor
adjoining the main ward. It was about six feet wide by ten long and of
a good height. A heavily screened and barred window admitted light and
a negligible quantity of air, for the ventilation scarcely deserved the
name. The walls and floor were bare, and there was no furniture. A
patient confined here must lie on the floor with no substitute for a
bed but one or two felt druggets. Sleeping under such conditions
becomes tolerable after a time, but not until one has become accustomed
to lying on a surface nearly as hard as a stone. Here (as well, indeed,
as in other parts of the ward) for a period of three weeks I was again
forced to breathe and rebreathe air so vitiated that even when I
occupied a larger room in the same ward, doctors and attendants seldom
entered without remarking its quality.

My first meal increased my distaste for my semi-sociological
experiment. For over a month I was kept in a half-starved condition. At
each meal, to be sure, I was given as much food as was served to other
patients, but an average portion was not adequate to the needs of a
patient as active as I was at this time.

Worst of all, winter was approaching and these, my first quarters, were
without heat. As my olfactory nerves soon became uncommunicative, the
breathing of foul air was not a hardship. On the other hand, to be
famished the greater part of the time was a very conscious hardship.
But to be half-frozen, day in and day out for a long period, was
exquisite torture. Of all the suffering I endured, that occasioned by
confinement in cold cells seems to have made the most lasting
impression. Hunger is a local disturbance, but when one is cold, every
nerve in the body registers its call for help. Long before reading a
certain passage of De Quincey's I had decided that cold could cause
greater suffering than hunger; consequently, it was with great
satisfaction that I read the following sentences from his
"Confessions": "O ancient women, daughters of toil and suffering, among
all the hardships and bitter inheritances of flesh that ye are called
upon to face, not one--not even hunger--seems in my eyes comparable to
that of nightly cold.... A more killing curse there does not exist for
man or woman than the bitter combat between the weariness that prompts
sleep and the keen, searching cold that forces you from that first
access of sleep to start up horror-stricken, and to seek warmth vainly
in renewed exercise, though long since fainting under fatigue."

The hardness of the bed and the coldness of the room were not all that
interfered with sleep. The short corridor in which I was placed was
known as the "Bull Pen"--a phrase eschewed by the doctors. It was
usually in an uproar, especially during the dark hours of the early
morning. Patients in a state of excitement may sleep during the first
hours of the night, but seldom all night; and even should one have the
capacity to do so, his companions in durance would wake him with a
shout or a song or a curse or the kicking of a door. A noisy and
chaotic medley frequently continued without interruption for hours at a
time. Noise, unearthly noise, was the poetic license allowed the
occupants of these cells. I spent several days and nights in one or
another of them, and I question whether I averaged more than two or
three hours' sleep a night during that time. Seldom did the regular
attendants pay any attention to the noise, though even they must at
times have been disturbed by it. In fact the only person likely to
attempt to stop it was the night watch, who, when he did enter a cell
for that purpose, almost invariably kicked or choked the noisy patient
into a state of temporary quiet. I noted this and scented trouble.

Drawing and writing materials having been again taken from me, I cast
about for some new occupation. I found one in the problem of warmth.
Though I gave repeated expression to the benumbed messages of my
tortured nerves, the doctor refused to return my clothes. For a
semblance of warmth I was forced to depend upon ordinary undergarments
and an extraordinary imagination. The heavy felt druggets were about as
plastic as blotting paper and I derived little comfort from them until
I hit upon the idea of rending them into strips. These strips I would
weave into a crude Rip Van Winkle kind of suit; and so intricate was
the warp and woof that on several occasions an attendant had to cut me
out of these sartorial improvisations. At first, until I acquired the
destructive knack, the tearing of one drugget into strips was a task of
four or five hours. But in time I became so proficient that I could
completely destroy more than one of these six-by-eight-foot druggets in
a single night. During the following weeks of my close confinement I
destroyed at least twenty of them, each worth, as I found out later,
about four dollars; and I confess I found a peculiar satisfaction in
the destruction of property belonging to a State which had deprived me
of all my effects except underclothes. But my destructiveness was due
to a variety of causes. It was occasioned primarily by a "pressure of
activity," for which the tearing of druggets served as a vent. I was in
a state of mind aptly described in a letter written during my first
month of elation, in which I said, "I'm as busy as a nest of ants."

Though the habit of tearing druggets was the outgrowth of an abnormal
impulse, the habit itself lasted longer than it could have done had I
not, for so long a time, been deprived of suitable clothes and been
held a prisoner in cold cells. But another motive soon asserted itself.
Being deprived of all the luxuries of life and most of the necessities,
my mother wit, always conspiring with a wild imagination for something
to occupy my tune, led me at last to invade the field of invention.
With appropriate contrariety, an unfamiliar and hitherto almost
detested line of investigation now attracted me. Abstruse mathematical
problems which had defied solution for centuries began to appear easy.
To defy the State and its puny representatives had become mere child's
play. So I forthwith decided to overcome no less a force than gravity
itself.

My conquering imagination soon tricked me into believing that I could
lift myself by my boot-straps--or rather that I could do so when my
laboratory should contain footgear that lent itself to the experiment.
But what of the strips of felt torn from the druggets? Why, these I
used as the straps of my missing boots; and having no boots to stand
in, I used my bed as boots. I reasoned that for my scientific purpose a
man in bed was as favorably situated as a man in boots. Therefore,
attaching a sufficient number of my felt strips to the head and foot of
the bed (which happened not to be screwed to the floor), and, in turn,
attaching the free ends to the transom and the window guard, I found
the problem very simple. For I next joined these cloth cables in such
manner that by pulling downward I effected a readjustment of stress and
strain, and my bed, _with me in it_, was soon dangling in space. My
sensations at this momentous instant must have been much like those
which thrilled Newton when he solved one of the riddles of the
universe. Indeed, they must have been more intense, for Newton,
knowing, had his doubts; I, not knowing, had no doubts at all. So
epoch-making did this discovery appear to me that I noted the exact
position of the bed so that a wondering posterity might ever afterward
view and revere the exact spot on the earth's surface whence one of
man's greatest thoughts had winged its way to immortality.

For weeks I believed I had uncovered a mechanical principle which would
enable man to defy gravity. And I talked freely and confidently about
it. That is, I proclaimed the impending results. The intermediate steps
in the solution of my problem I ignored, for good reasons. A blind man
may harness a horse. So long as the horse is harnessed, one need not
know the office of each strap and buckle. Gravity was harnessed--that
was all. Meanwhile I felt sure that another sublime moment of
inspiration would intervene and clear the atmosphere, thus rendering
flight of the body as easy as a flight of imagination.




XX


While my inventive operations were in progress, I was chafing under the
unjust and certainly unscientific treatment to which I was being
subjected. In spite of my close confinement in vile cells, for a period
of over three weeks I was denied a bath. I do not regret this
deprivation, for the attendants, who at the beginning were unfriendly,
might have forced me to bathe in water which had first served for
several other patients. Though such an unsanitary and disgusting
practice was contrary to rules, it was often indulged in by the lazy
brutes who controlled the ward.

I continued to object to the inadequate portions of food served me. On
Thanksgiving Day (for I had not succeeded in escaping and joining in
the celebration at home) an attendant, in the unaccustomed rôle of a
ministering angel, brought me the usual turkey and cranberry dinner
which, on two days a year, is provided by an intermittently generous
State. Turkey being the _rara avis_ the imprisoned, it was but natural
that I should desire to gratify a palate long insulted. I wished not
only to satisfy my appetite, but to impress indelibly a memory which
for months had not responded to so agreeable a stimulus. While
lingering over the delights of this experience I forgot all about the
ministering angel. But not for long. He soon returned. Observing that I
had scarcely touched my feast, he said, "If you don't eat that dinner
in a hurry, I'll take it from you."

"I don't see what difference it makes to you whether I eat it in a
hurry or take my time about it," I said. "It's the best I've had in
many a day, and I have a right to get as much pleasure out of it as I
can."

"We'll see about that," he replied, and, snatching it away, he stalked
out of the room, leaving me to satisfy my hunger on the memory of
vanished luxuries. Thus did a feast become a fast.

Under this treatment I soon learned to be more noisy than my neighbors.
I was never without a certain humor in contemplating not only my
surroundings, but myself; and the demonstrations in which I began to
indulge were partly in fun and partly by way of protest. In these
outbursts I was assisted, and at times inspired, by a young man in the
room next mine. He was about my own age and was enjoying the same phase
of exuberance as myself. We talked and sang at all hours of the night.
At the time we believed that the other patients enjoyed the spice which
we added to the restricted variety of their lives, but later I learned
that a majority of them looked upon us as the worst of nuisances.

We gave the doctors and attendants no rest--at least not intentionally.
Whenever the assistant physician appeared, we upbraided him for the
neglect which was then our portion. At one time or another we were
banished to the Bull Pen for these indiscretions. And had there been a
viler place of confinement still, our performances in the Bull Pen
undoubtedly would have brought us to it. At last the doctor hit upon
the expedient of transferring me to a room more remote from my
inspiring, and, I may say, conspiring, companion. Talking to each other
ceased to be the easy pastime it had been; so we gradually lapsed into
a comparative silence which must have proved a boon to our ward-mates.
The megaphonic Bull Pen, however, continued with irregularity, but
annoying certainty to furnish its quota of noise.

On several occasions I concocted plans to escape, and not only that,
but also to liberate others. That I did not make the attempt was the
fault--or merit, perhaps--of a certain night watch, whose timidity,
rather than sagacity, impelled him to refuse to unlock my door early
one morning, although I gave him a plausible reason for the request.
This night watch, I learned later, admitted that he feared to encounter
me single-handed. And on this particular occasion well might he, for,
during the night, I had woven a spider-web net in which I intended to
enmesh him. Had I succeeded, there would have been a lively hour for
him in the violent ward--had I failed, there would have been a lively
hour for me. There were several comparatively sane patients (especially
my elated neighbor) whose willing assistance I could have secured. Then
the regular attendants could have been held prisoners in their own
room, if, indeed, we had not in turn overpowered them and transferred
them to the Bull Pen, where the several victims of their abuse might
have given them a deserved dose of their own medicine. This scheme of
mine was a prank rather than a plot. I had an inordinate desire to
prove that one _could_ escape if he had a mind to do so. Later I
boasted to the assistant physician of my unsuccessful attempt. This
boast he evidently tucked away in his memory.

My punishment for harmless antics of this sort was prompt in coming.
The attendants seemed to think their whole duty to their closely
confined charges consisted in delivering three meals a day. Between
meals he was a rash patient who interfered with their leisure. Now one
of my greatest crosses was their continued refusal to give me a drink
when I asked for it. Except at meal time, or on those rare occasions
when I was permitted to go to the wash room, I had to get along as best
I might with no water to drink, and that too at a time when I was in a
fever of excitement. My polite requests were ignored; impolite demands
were answered with threats and curses. And this war of requests,
demands, threats, and curses continued until the night of the fourth
day of my banishment. Then the attendants made good their threats of
assault. That they had been trying to goad me into a fighting mood I
well knew, and often accused them of their mean purpose. They brazenly
admitted that they were simply waiting for a chance to "slug" me, and
promised to punish me well as soon as I should give them a slight
excuse for doing so.

On the night of November 25th, 1902, the head attendant and one of his
assistants passed my door. They were returning from one of the dances
which, at intervals during the winter, the management provides for the
nurses and attendants. While they were within hearing, I asked for a
drink of water. It was a carefully worded request. But they were in a
hurry to get to bed, and refused me with curses. Then I replied in
kind.

"If I come there I'll kill you," one of them said.

"Well, you won't get in if I can help it," I replied, as I braced my
iron bedstead against the door.

My defiance and defences gave the attendants the excuse for which they
had said they were waiting; and my success in keeping them out for two
or three minutes only served to enrage them. By the time they had
gained entrance they had become furies. One was a young man of
twenty-seven. Physically he was a fine specimen of manhood; morally he
was deficient--thanks to the dehumanizing effect of several years in
the employ of different institutions whose officials countenanced
improper methods of care and treatment. It was he who now attacked me
in the dark of my prison room. The head attendant stood by, holding a
lantern which shed a dim light.

The door once open, I offered no further resistance. First I was
knocked down. Then for several minutes I was kicked about the
room--struck, kneed and choked. My assailant even attempted to grind
his heel into my cheek. In this he failed, for I was there protected by
a heavy beard which I wore at that time. But my shins, elbows, and back
were cut by his heavy shoes; and had I not instinctively drawn up my
knees to my elbows for the protection of my body, I might have been
seriously, perhaps fatally, injured. As it was, I was severely cut and
bruised. When my strength was nearly gone, I feigned unconsciousness.
This ruse alone saved me from further punishment, for usually a
premeditated assault is not ended until the patient is mute and
helpless. When they had accomplished their purpose, they left me
huddled in a corner to wear out the night as best I might--to live or
die for all they cared.

Strange as it may seem, I slept well. But not at once. Within five
minutes I was busily engaged writing an account of the assault. A
trained war correspondent could not have pulled himself together in
less time. As usual I had recourse to my bit of contraband lead pencil,
this time a pencil which had been smuggled to me the very first day of
my confinement in the Bull Pen by a sympathetic fellow-patient. When he
had pushed under my cell door that little implement of war, it had
loomed as large in my mind as a battering-ram. Paper I had none; but I
had previously found walls to be a fair substitute. I therefore now
selected and wrote upon a rectangular spot--about three feet by
two--which marked the reflection of a light in the corridor just
outside my transom.

The next morning, when the assistant physician appeared, he was
accompanied as usual by the guilty head attendant who, on the previous
night, had held the lantern.

"Doctor," I said, "I have something to tell you,"--and I glanced
significantly at the attendant. "Last night I had a most unusual
experience. I have had many imaginary experiences during the past two
years and a half, and it may be that last night's was not real. Perhaps
the whole thing was phantasmagoric--like what I used to see during the
first months of my illness. Whether it was so or not I shall leave you
to judge. It just happens to be my impression that I was brutally
assaulted last night. If it was a dream, it is the first thing of the
kind that ever left visible evidence on my body."

With that I uncovered to the doctor a score of bruises and lacerations.
I knew these would be more impressive than any words of mine. The
doctor put on a knowing look, but said nothing and soon left the room.
His guilty subordinate tried to appear unconcerned, and I really
believe he thought me not absolutely sure of the events of the previous
night, or at least unaware of his share in them.




XXI


Neither of the attendants involved in the assault upon me was
discharged. This fact made me more eager to gain wider knowledge of
conditions. The self-control which had enabled me to suspend speech for
a whole day now stood me in good stead. It enabled me to avert much
suffering that would have been my portion had I been like the majority
of my ward-mates. Time and again I surrendered when an attendant was
about to chastise me. But at least a score of patients in the ward were
not so well equipped mentally, and these were viciously assaulted again
and again by the very men who had so thoroughly initiated me into the
mysteries of their black art.

I soon observed that the only patients who were not likely to be
subjected to abuse were the very ones least in need of care and
treatment. The violent, noisy, and troublesome patient was abused
because he was violent, noisy, and troublesome. The patient too weak,
physically or mentally, to attend to his own wants was frequently
abused because of that very helplessness which made it necessary for
the attendants to wait upon him.

Usually a restless or troublesome patient placed in the violent ward
was assaulted the very first day. This procedure seemed to be a part of
the established code of dishonor. The attendants imagined that the best
way to gain control of a patient was to cow him from the first. In
fact, these fellows--nearly all of them ignorant and untrained--seemed
to believe that "violent cases" could not be handled in any other way.
One attendant, on the very day he had been discharged for choking a
patient into an insensibility so profound that it had been necessary to
call a physician to restore him, said to me, "They are getting pretty
damned strict these days, discharging a man simply for _choking_ a
patient." This illustrates the attitude of many attendants. On the
other hand, that the discharged employé soon secured a position in a
similar institution not twenty miles distant illustrates the attitude
of some hospital managements.

I recall the advent of a new attendant--a young man studying to become
a physician. At first he seemed inclined to treat patients kindly, but
he soon fell into brutal ways. His change of heart was due partly to
the brutalizing environment, but more directly to the attitude of the
three hardened attendants who mistook his consideration for cowardice
and taunted him for it. Just to prove his mettle he began to assault
patients, and one day knocked me down simply for refusing to stop my
prattle at his command. That the environment in some institutions is
brutalizing, was strikingly shown in the testimony of an attendant at a
public investigation in Kentucky, who said, "When I came here, if
anyone had told me I would be guilty of striking patients I would have
called him crazy himself, but now I take delight in punching hell out
of them."

I found also that an unnecessary and continued lack of out-door
exercise tended to multiply deeds of violence. Patients were supposed
to be taken for a walk at least once a day, and twice, when the weather
permitted. Yet those in the violent ward (and it is they who most need
the exercise) usually got out of doors only when the attendants saw fit
to take them. For weeks a ward-mate--a man sane enough to enjoy
freedom, had he had a home to go to--kept a record of the number of our
walks. It showed that we averaged not more than one or two a week for a
period of two months. This, too, in the face of many pleasant days,
which made the close confinement doubly irksome. The lazy fellows on
whose leisure we waited preferred to remain in the ward, playing cards,
smoking, and telling their kind of stories. The attendants needed
regular exercise quite as much as the patients and when they failed to
employ their energy in this healthful way, they were likely to use it
at the expense of the bodily comfort of their helpless charges.

If lack of exercise produced a need of discipline, each disciplinary
move, on the other hand, served only to inflame us the more. Some wild
animals can be clubbed into a semblance of obedience, yet it is a
treacherous obedience at best, and justly so. And that is the only kind
of obedience into which a _man_ can be clubbed. To imagine otherwise of
a human being, sane or insane, is the very essence of insanity itself.
A temporary leisure may be won for the aggressor, but in the long run
he will be put to greater inconvenience than he would be by a more
humane method. It was repression and wilful frustration of reasonable
desires which kept me a seeming maniac and made seeming maniacs of
others. Whenever I was released from lock and key and permitted to
mingle with the so-called violent patients, I was surprised to find
that comparatively few were by nature troublesome or noisy. A patient,
calm in mind and passive in behavior three hundred and sixty days in
the year, may, on one of the remaining days, commit some slight
transgression, or, more likely, be goaded into one by an attendant or
needlessly led into one by a tactless physician. His indiscretion may
consist merely in an unmannerly announcement to the doctor of how
lightly the latter is regarded by the patient. At once he is banished
to the violent ward, there to remain for weeks, perhaps indefinitely.




XXII


Like fires and railroad disasters, assaults seemed to come in groups.
Days would pass without a single outbreak. Then would come a veritable
carnival of abuse--due almost invariably to the attendants' state of
mind, not to an unwonted aggressiveness on the part of the patients. I
can recall as especially noteworthy several instances of atrocious
abuse. Five patients were chronic victims. Three of them, peculiarly
irresponsible, suffered with especial regularity, scarcely a day
passing without bringing to them its quota of punishment. One of these,
almost an idiot, and quite too inarticulate to tell a convincing story
even under the most favorable conditions, became so cowed that,
whenever an attendant passed, he would circle his oppressor as a
whipped cur circles a cruel master. If this avoidance became too
marked, the attendant would then and there chastise him for the
implied, but unconscious insult.

There was a young man, occupying a cell next to mine in the Bull Pen,
who was so far out of his mind as to be absolutely irresponsible. His
offence was that he could not comprehend and obey. Day after day I
could hear the blows and kicks as they fell upon his body, and his
incoherent cries for mercy were as painful to hear as they are
impossible to forget. That he survived is surprising. What wonder that
this man, who was "violent," or who was made violent, would not permit
the attendants to dress him! But he had a half-witted friend, a
ward-mate, who could coax him into his clothes when his oppressors
found him most intractable.

Of all the patients known to me, the one who was assaulted with the
greatest frequency was an incoherent and irresponsible man of sixty
years. This patient was restless and forever talking or shouting, as
any man might if oppressed by such delusions as his. He was profoundly
convinced that one of the patients had stolen his stomach--an idea
inspired perhaps by the remarkable corpulency of the person he accused.
His loss he would woefully voice even while eating. Of course, argument
to the contrary had no effect; and his monotonous recital of his
imaginary troubles made him unpopular with those whose business it was
to care for him. They showed him no mercy. Each day--including the
hours of the night, when the night watch took a hand--he was belabored
with fists, broom handles, and frequently with the heavy bunch of keys
which attendants usually carry on a long chain. He was also kicked and
choked, and his suffering was aggravated by his almost continuous
confinement in the Bull Pen. An exception to the general rule (for such
continued abuse often causes death), this man lived a long time--five
years, as I learned later.

Another victim, forty-five years of age, was one who had formerly been
a successful man of affairs. His was a forceful personality, and the
traits of his sane days influenced his conduct when he broke down
mentally. He was in the expansive phase of paresis, a phase
distinguished by an exaggerated sense of well-being, and by delusions
of grandeur which are symptoms of this form as well as of several other
forms of mental disease. Paresis, as everyone knows, is considered
incurable and victims of it seldom live more than three or four years.
In this instance, instead of trying to make the patient's last days
comfortable, the attendants subjected him to a course of treatment
severe enough to have sent even a sound man to an early grave. I
endured privations and severe abuse for one month at the State
Hospital. This man suffered in all ways worse treatment for many
months.

I became well acquainted with two jovial and witty Irishmen. They were
common laborers. One was a hodcarrier, and a strapping fellow. When he
arrived at the institution, he was at once placed in the violent ward,
though his "violence" consisted of nothing more than an annoying sort
of irresponsibility. He irritated the attendants by persistently doing
certain trivial things after they had been forbidden. The attendants
made no allowance for his condition of mind. His repetition of a
forbidden act was interpreted as deliberate disobedience. He was
physically powerful, and they determined to cow him. Of the master
assault by which they attempted to do this I was not an eyewitness. But
I was an ear witness. It was committed behind a closed door; and I
heard the dull thuds of the blows, and I heard the cries for mercy
until there was no breath left in the man with which he could beg even
for his life. For days, that wrecked Hercules dragged himself about the
ward moaning pitifully. He complained of pain in his side and had
difficulty in breathing, which would seem to indicate that some of his
ribs had been fractured. This man was often punished, frequently for
complaining of the torture already inflicted. But later, when he began
to return to the normal, his good-humor and native wit won for him an
increasing degree of good treatment.

The other patient's arch offence--a symptom of his disease--was that he
gabbled incessantly. He could no more stop talking than he could right
his reason on command. Yet his failure to become silent at a word was
the signal for punishment. On one occasion an attendant ordered him to
stop talking and take a seat at the further end of the corridor, about
forty feet distant. He was doing his best to obey, even running to keep
ahead of the attendant at his heels. As they passed the spot where I
was sitting, the attendant felled him with a blow behind the ear; and,
in falling, the patient's head barely missed the wall.

Addressing me, the attendant said, "Did you see that?"

"Yes," I replied, "and I'll not forget it."

"Be sure to report it to the doctor," he said, which remark showed his
contempt, not only for me, but for those in authority.

The man who had so terribly beaten me was particularly flagrant in
ignoring the claims of age. On more than one occasion he viciously
attacked a man of over fifty, who, however, seemed much older. He was a
Yankee sailing-master, who in his prime could have thrashed his
tormentor with ease. But now he was helpless and could only submit.
However, he was not utterly abandoned by his old world. His wife called
often to see him; and, because of his condition, she was permitted to
visit him in his room. Once she arrived a few hours after he had been
cruelly beaten. Naturally she asked the attendants how he had come by
the hurts--the blackened eye and bruised head. True to the code, they
lied. The good wife, perhaps herself a Yankee, was not thus to be
fooled; and her growing belief that her husband had been assaulted was
confirmed by a sight she saw before her visit was ended. Another
patient, a foreigner who was a target for abuse, was knocked flat two
or three times as he was roughly forced along the corridor. I saw this
little affair and I saw that the good wife saw it. The next day she
called again and took her husband home. The result was that after a few
(probably sleepless) nights, she had to return him to the hospital and
trust to God rather than the State to protect him.

Another victim was a man sixty years of age. He was quite inoffensive,
and no patient in the ward seemed to attend more strictly to his own
business. Shortly after my transfer from the violent ward this man was
so viciously attacked that his arm was broken. The attendant (the man
who had so viciously assaulted me) was summarily discharged.
Unfortunately, however, the relief afforded the insane was slight and
brief, for this same brute, like another whom I have mentioned, soon
secured a position in another institution--this one, however, a
thousand miles distant.

Death by violence in a violent ward is after all not an unnatural
death--for a violent ward. The patient of whom I am about to speak was
also an old man--over sixty. Both physically and mentally he was a
wreck. On being brought to the institution he was at once placed in a
cell in the Bull Pen, probably because of his previous history for
violence while at his own home. But his violence (if it ever existed)
had already spent itself, and had come to be nothing more than an utter
incapacity to obey. His offence was that he was too weak to attend to
his common wants. The day after his arrival, shortly before noon, he
lay stark naked and helpless upon the bed in his cell. This I know, for
I went to investigate immediately after a ward-mate had informed me of
the vicious way in which the head attendant had assaulted the sick man.
My informant was a man whose word regarding an incident of this
character I would take as readily as that of any man I know. He came to
me, knowing that I had taken upon myself the duty of reporting such
abominations. My informant feared to take the initiative, for, like
many other patients who believe themselves doomed to continued
confinement, he feared to invite abuse at the hands of vengeful
attendants. I therefore promised him that I would report the case as
soon as I had an opportunity.

All day long this victim of an attendant's unmanly passion lay in his
cell in what seemed to be a semi-conscious condition. I took particular
pains to observe his condition, for I felt that the assault of the
morning might result in death. That night, after the doctor's regular
tour of inspection, the patient in question was transferred to a room
next my own. The mode of transfer impressed itself upon my memory. Two
attendants--one of them being he who had so brutally beaten the
patient--placed the man in a sheet and, each taking an end, carried the
hammocklike contrivance, with its inert contents, to what proved to be
its last resting-place above ground. The bearers seemed as much
concerned about their burden as one might be about a dead dog, weighted
and ready for the river.

That night the patient died. Whether he was murdered none can ever
know. But it is my honest opinion that he was. Though he might never
have recovered, it is plain that he would have lived days, perhaps
months. And had he been humanely, nay, scientifically, treated, who can
say that he might not have been restored to health and home?

The young man who had been my companion in mischief in the violent ward
was also terribly abused. I am sure I do not exaggerate when I say that
on ten occasions, within a period of two months, this man was cruelly
assaulted, and I do not know how many times he suffered assaults of
less severity. After one of these chastisements, I asked him why he
persisted in his petty transgressions when he knew that he thereby
invited such body-racking abuse.

"Oh," he said, laconically, "I need the exercise."

To my mind, the man who, with such gracious humor, could refer to what
was in reality torture deserved to live a century. But an unkind fate
decreed that he should die young. Ten months after his commitment to
the State Hospital he was discharged as improved--but not cured. This
was not an unusual procedure; nor was it in his case apparently an
unwise one, for he seemed fit for freedom. During the first month of
regained liberty, he hanged himself. He left no message of excuse. In
my opinion, none was necessary. For aught any man knows, the memories
of the abuse, torture, and injustice which were so long his portion may
have proved to be the last straw which overbalanced the desire to live.

Patients with less stamina than mine often submitted with meekness; and
none so aroused my sympathy as those whose submission was due to the
consciousness that they had no relatives or friends to support them in
a fight for their rights. On behalf of these, with my usual piece of
smuggled lead pencil, I soon began to indite and submit to the officers
of the institution, letters in which I described the cruel practices
which came under my notice. My reports were perfunctorily accepted and
at once forgotten or ignored. Yet these letters, so far as they related
to overt acts witnessed, were lucid and should have been convincing.
Furthermore, my allegations were frequently corroborated by bruises on
the bodies of the patients. My usual custom was to write an account of
each assault and hand it to the doctor in authority. Frequently I would
submit these reports to the attendants with instructions first to read
and then deliver them to the superintendent or the assistant physician.
The men whose cruelty I thus laid bare read with evident but perverted
pleasure my accounts of assaults, and laughed and joked about my
ineffectual attempts to bring them to book.




XXXIII


I refused to be a martyr. Rebellion was my watchword. The only
difference between the doctor's opinion of me and mine of him was that
he could refuse utterance to his thoughts. Yes--there was another
difference. Mine could be expressed only in words--his in grim acts.

I repeatedly made demands for those privileges to which I knew I was
entitled. When he saw fit to grant them, I gave him perfunctory thanks.
When he refused--as he usually did--I at once poured upon his head the
vials of my wrath. One day I would be on the friendliest terms with the
doctor, the next I would upbraid him for some denial of my rights--or,
as frequently happened, for not intervening in behalf of the rights of
others.

It was after one of these wrangles that I was placed in a cold cell in
the Bull Pen at eleven o'clock one morning. Still without shoes and
with no more covering than underclothes, I was forced to stand, sit, or
lie upon a bare floor as hard and cold as the pavement outside. Not
until sundown was I provided even with a drugget, and this did little
good, for already I had become thoroughly chilled. In consequence I
contracted a severe cold which added greatly to my discomfort and might
have led to serious results had I been of less sturdy fibre.

This day was the thirteenth of December and the twenty-second of my
exile in the violent ward. I remember it distinctly for it was the
seventy-seventh birthday of my father, to whom I wished to write a
congratulatory letter. This had been my custom for years when absent
from home on that anniversary. And well do I remember when, and under
what conditions, I asked the doctor for permission. It was night. I was
flat on my drugget-bed. My cell was lighted only by the feeble rays of
a lantern held by an attendant to the doctor on this his regular visit.
At first I couched my request in polite language. The doctor merely
refused to grant it. I then put forth my plea in a way calculated to
arouse sympathy. He remained unmoved. I then pointed out that he was
defying the law of the State which provided that a patient should have
stationery--a statute, the spirit of which at least meant that he
should be permitted to communicate with his conservator. It was now
three weeks since I had been permitted to write or send a letter to
anyone. Contrary to my custom, therefore, I made my final demand in the
form of a concession. I promised that I would write only a conventional
note of congratulation, making no mention whatever of my plight. It was
a fair offer; but to accept it would have been an implied admission
that there was something to conceal, and for this, if for no other
reason, it was refused.

Thus, day after day, I was repressed in a manner which probably would
have driven many a sane man to violence. Yet the doctor would
frequently exhort me to play the gentleman. Were good manners and sweet
submission ever the product of such treatment? Deprived of my clothes,
of sufficient food, of warmth, of all sane companionship and of my
liberty, I told those in authority that so long as they should continue
to treat me as the vilest of criminals, I should do my best to complete
the illusion. The burden of proving my sanity was placed upon me. I was
told that so soon as I became polite and meek and lowly I should find
myself in possession of my clothes and of certain privileges. In every
instance I must earn my reward before being entrusted with it. If the
doctor, instead of demanding of me all the negative virtues in the
catalogue of spineless saints, had given me my clothes on the condition
that they would be taken from me again if I so much as removed a
button, his course would doubtless have been productive of good
results. Thus I might have had my clothes three weeks earlier than I
did, and so been spared much suffering from the cold.

I clamored daily for a lead pencil. This little luxury represents the
margin of happiness for hundreds of the patients, just as a plug or
package of tobacco represents the margin of happiness for thousands of
others; but for seven weeks no doctor or attendant gave me one. To be
sure, by reason of my somewhat exceptional persistence and ingenuity, I
managed to be always in possession of some substitute for a pencil,
surreptitiously obtained, a fact which no doubt had something to do
with the doctor's indifference to my request. But my inability to
secure a pencil in a legitimate way was a needless source of annoyance
to me, and many of my verbal indiscretions were directly inspired by
the doctor's continued refusal.

It was an assistant physician, other than the one regularly in charge
of my case, who at last relented and presented me with a good, whole
lead pencil. By so doing he placed himself high on my list of
benefactors; for that little shaftlike implement, magnified by my
lively appreciation, became as the very axis of the earth.




XXIV


A few days before Christmas my most galling deprivation was at last
removed. That is, my clothes were restored. These I treated with great
respect. Not so much as a thread did I destroy. Clothes, as is known,
have a sobering and civilizing effect, and from the very moment I was
again provided with presentable outer garments my conduct rapidly
improved. The assistant physician with whom I had been on such variable
terms of friendship and enmity even took me for a sleigh-ride. With
this improvement came other privileges or, rather, the granting of my
rights. Late in December I was permitted to send letters to my
conservator. Though some of my blood-curdling letters were confiscated,
a few detailing my experiences were forwarded. The account of my
sufferings naturally distressed my conservator, but, as he said when he
next visited me: "What could I have done to help you? If the men in
this State whose business it is to run these institutions cannot manage
you, I am at a loss to know what to do." True, he could have done
little or nothing, for he did not then know the ins and outs of the
baffling situation into which the ties of blood had drawn him.

About the middle of January the doctor in charge of my case went for a
two weeks' vacation. During his absence an older member of the staff
took charge of the violent ward. A man of wider experience and more
liberal ideas than his predecessor, he at once granted me several real
privileges. One day he permitted me to pay a brief visit to the best
ward--the one from which I had been transferred two months earlier. I
thus was able again to mingle with many seemingly normal men, and
though I enjoyed this privilege upon but one occasion, and then only
for a few hours, it gave me intense satisfaction.

Altogether the last six weeks of the fourteen during which I was
confined in the violent ward were comfortable and relatively happy. I
was no longer subjected to physical abuse, though this exemption was
largely due to my own skill in avoiding trouble. I was no longer cold
and hungry. I was allowed a fair amount of outdoor exercise which,
after my close confinement, proved to be a delightful shock. But, above
all, I was again given an adequate supply of stationery and drawing
materials, which became as tinder under the focussed rays of my
artistic eagerness. My mechanical investigations were gradually set
aside. Art and literature again held sway. Except when out of doors
taking my allotted exercise, I remained in my room reading, writing, or
drawing. This room of mine soon became a Mecca for the most
irrepressible and loquacious characters in the ward. But I soon
schooled myself to shut my ears to the incoherent prattle of my
unwelcome visitors. Occasionally, some of them would become
obstreperous--perhaps because of my lordly order to leave the room.
Often did they threaten to throttle me; but I ignored the threats, and
they were never carried out. Nor was I afraid that they would be.
Invariably I induced them to obey.

The drawings I produced at this time were crude. For the most part they
consisted of copies of illustrations which I had cut from magazines
that had miraculously found their way into the violent ward. The heads
of men and women interested me most, for I had decided to take up
portraiture. At first I was content to draw in black and white, but I
soon procured some colors and from that time on devoted my attention to
mastering pastel.

In the world of letters I had made little progress. My compositions
were for the most part epistles addressed to relatives and friends and
to those in authority at the hospital. Frequently the letters addressed
to the doctors were sent in sets of three--this to save time, for I was
very busy. The first letter of such a series would contain my request,
couched in friendly and polite terms. To this I would add a postscript,
worded about as follows: "If, after reading this letter, you feel
inclined to refuse my request, please read letter number two." Letter
number two would be severely formal--a business-like repetition of the
request made in letter number one. Again a postscript would advise the
reader to consult letter number three, if the reading of number two had
failed to move him. Letter number three was invariably a brief
philippic in which I would consign the unaccommodating doctor to
oblivion.

In this way I expended part of my prodigious supply of feeling and
energy. But I had also another way of reducing my creative pressure.
Occasionally, from sheer excess of emotion, I would burst into verse,
of a quality not to be doubted. Of that quality the reader shall judge,
for I am going to quote a "creation" written under circumstances which,
to say the least, were adverse. Before writing these lines I had never
attempted verse in my life--barring intentionally inane doggerel. And,
as I now judge these lines, it is probably true that even yet I have
never written a poem. Nevertheless, my involuntary, almost automatic
outburst is at least suggestive of the fervor that was in me. These
fourteen lines were written within thirty minutes of the time I first
conceived the idea; and I present them substantially as they first took
form. From a psychological standpoint at least, I am told, they are not
without interest.

    LIGHT

    Man's darkest hour is the hour before he's born,
    Another is the hour just before the Dawn;
    From Darkness unto Life and Light he leaps,
    To Life but once,--to Light as oft as God wills he should.
    'Tis God's own secret, why
    Some live long, and others early die;
    For Life depends on Light, and Light on God,
    Who hath given to Man the perfect knowledge
    That Grim Despair and Sorrow end in Light
    And Life everlasting, in realms
    Where darkest Darkness becomes Light;
    But not the Light Man knows,
    Which only is Light
    Because God told Man so.

These verses, which breathe religion, were written in an environment
which was anything but religious. With curses of ward-mates ringing in
my ears, some subconscious part of me seemed to force me to write at
its dictation. I was far from being in a pious frame of mind myself,
and the quality of my thought surprised me then--as it does now.




XXV


Though I continued to respect my clothes, I did not at once cease to
tear such material as would serve me in my scientific investigations.
Gravity being conquered, it was inevitable that I should devote some of
my time to the invention of a flying-machine. This was soon
perfected--in my mind; and all I needed, that I might test the device,
was my liberty. As usual I was unable to explain how I should produce
the result which I so confidently foretold. But I believed and
proclaimed that I should, erelong, fly to St. Louis and claim and
receive the one-hundred-thousand-dollar reward offered by the
Commission of the Louisiana Purchase Exposition for the most efficient
airship to be exhibited. The moment the thought winged its way through
my mind, I had not only a flying-machine, but a fortune in the bank.
Being where I could not dissipate my riches, I became a lavish verbal
spender. I was in a mood to buy anything, and I whiled away many an
hour planning what I should do with my fortune. The St. Louis prize was
a paltry trifle. I reasoned that the man who could harness gravity had
at his beck and call the world and all that therein is. This sudden
accession of wealth made my vast humanitarian projects seem only the
more feasible. What could be more delightful, I thought, than the
furnishing and financing of ideas of a magnitude to stagger humanity.
My condition was one of ecstatic suspense. Give me my liberty and I
would show a sleepy old world what could be done to improve conditions,
not only among the insane, but along every line of beneficent endeavor.

The city of my birth was to be made a garden-spot. All defiling,
smoke-begriming factories were to be banished to an innocuous distance.
Churches were to give way to cathedrals; the city itself was to become
a paradise of mansions. Yale University was to be transformed into the
most magnificent--yet efficient--seat of learning in the world. For
once, college professors were to be paid adequate salaries, and
alluring provision for their declining years was to be made. New Haven
should become a very hotbed of culture. Art galleries, libraries,
museums and theatres of a dreamlike splendor were to rise whenever and
wherever I should will. Why absurd? Was it not I who would defray the
cost? The famous buildings of the Old World were to be reproduced, if,
indeed, the originals could not be purchased, brought to this country
and reassembled. Not far from New Haven there is a sandy plain, once
the bed of the Connecticut River, but now a kind of miniature desert. I
often smile as I pass it on the train; for it was here, for the
edification of those who might never be able to visit the Valley of the
Nile, that I planned to erect a pyramid that should out-Cheops the
original. My harnessed gravity, I believed, would not only enable me to
overcome existing mechanical difficulties, but it would make the
quarrying of immense monoliths as easy as the slicing of bread, and the
placing of them in position as easy as the laying of bricks.

After all, delusions of grandeur are the most entertaining of toys. The
assortment which my imagination provided was a comprehensive one. I had
tossed aside the blocks of childhood days. Instead of laboriously
piling small squares of wood one upon another in an endeavor to build
the tiny semblance of a house, I now, in this second childhood of mine,
projected against thin air phantom edifices planned and completed in
the twinkling of an eye. To be sure, such houses of cards almost
immediately superseded one another, but the vanishing of one could not
disturb a mind that had ever another interesting bauble to take its
place. And therein lies part of the secret of the happiness peculiar to
that stage of elation which is distinguished by delusions of
grandeur--always provided that he who is possessed by them be not
subjected to privation and abuse. The sane man who can prove that he is
rich in material wealth is not nearly so happy as the mentally
disordered man whose delusions trick him into believing himself a
modern Croesus. A wealth of Midaslike delusions is no burden. Such a
fortune, though a misfortune in itself, bathes the world in a golden
glow. No clouds obscure the vision. Optimism reigns supreme. "Failure"
and "impossible" are as words from an unknown tongue. And the unique
satisfaction about a fortune of this fugitive type is that its loss
occasions no regret. One by one the phantom ships of treasure sail away
for parts unknown; until, when the last ship has become but a speck on
the mental horizon, the observer makes the happy discovery that his
pirate fleet has left behind it a priceless wake of Reason!




XXVI


Early in March, 1902, having lived in a violent ward for nearly four
months, I was transferred to another--a ward quite as orderly as the
best in the institution, though less attractively furnished than the
one in which I had first been placed. Here also I had a room to myself;
in this instance, however, the room had not only a bed, but a chair and
a wardrobe. With this elaborate equipment I was soon able to convert my
room into a veritable studio. Whereas in the violent ward it had been
necessary for me to hide my writing and drawing materials to keep other
patients from taking them, in my new abode I was able to conduct my
literary and artistic pursuits without the annoyances which had been
inevitable during the preceding months.

Soon after my transfer to this ward I was permitted to go out of doors
and walk to the business section of the city, two miles distant. But on
these walks I was always accompanied. To one who has never surrendered
any part of his liberty such surveillance would no doubt seem irksome;
yet, to me, after being so closely confined, the ever-present attendant
seemed a companion rather than a guard. These excursions into the sane
and free world were not only a great pleasure, they were almost a
tonic. To rub elbows with normal people tended to restore my mental
poise. That the casual passer-by had no way of knowing that I was a
patient, out for a walk about the city, helped me gain that
self-confidence so essential to the success of one about to re-enter a
world from which he had long been cut off.

My first trips to the city were made primarily for the purpose of
supplying myself with writing and drawing materials. While enjoying
these welcome tastes of liberty, on more than one occasion I
surreptitiously mailed certain letters which I did not dare entrust to
the doctor. Under ordinary circumstances such an act on the part of one
enjoying a special privilege would be dishonorable. But the
circumstances that then obtained were not ordinary. I was simply
protecting myself against what I believed to be unjust and illegal
confiscation of letters.

I have already described how an assistant physician arbitrarily denied
my request that I be permitted to send a birthday letter to my father,
thereby not merely exceeding his authority and ignoring decency, but,
consciously or unconsciously, stifling a sane impulse. That this should
occur while I was confined in the Bull Pen was, perhaps, not so
surprising. But about four months later, while I was in one of the best
wards, a similar, though less open, interference occurred. At this time
I was so nearly normal that my discharge was a question of but a very
few months. Anticipating my return to my old world, I decided to renew
former relationships. Accordingly, my brother, at my suggestion,
informed certain friends that I should be pleased to receive letters
from them. They soon wrote. In the meantime the doctor had been
instructed to deliver to me any and all letters that might arrive. He
did so for a time, and that without censoring. As was to be expected,
after nearly three almost letterless years, I found rare delight in
replying to my reawakened correspondents. Yet some of these letters,
written for the deliberate purpose of re-establishing myself in the
sane world, were destroyed by the doctor in authority. At the time, not
one word did he say to me about the matter. I had handed him for
mailing certain letters, unsealed. He did not mail them, nor did he
forward them to my conservator as he should have done, and had earlier
agreed to do with all letters which he could not see his way clear to
approve. It was fully a month before I learned that my friends had not
received my replies to their letters. Then I accused the doctor of
destroying them, and he, with belated frankness, admitted that he had
done so. He offered no better excuse than the mere statement that he
did not approve of the sentiments I had expressed. Another flagrant
instance was that of a letter addressed to me in reply to one of those
which I had posted surreptitiously. The person to whom I wrote, a
friend of years' standing, later informed me that he had sent the
reply. I never received it. Neither did my conservator. Were it not
that I feel absolutely sure that the letter in question was received at
the hospital and destroyed, I should not now raise this point. But such
a point, if raised at all, must of course be made without that direct
proof which can come only from the man guilty of an act which in the
sane world is regarded as odious and criminal.

I therefore need not dilate on the reasons which made it necessary for
me to smuggle, as it were, to the Governor of the State, a letter of
complaint and instruction. This letter was written shortly after my
transfer from the violent ward. The abuses of that ward were still
fresh in my mind, and the memory of distressing scenes was kept vivid
by reports reaching me from friends who were still confined there.
These private sleuths of mine I talked with at the evening
entertainments or at other gatherings. From them I learned that
brutality had become more rife, if anything, since I had left the ward.
Realizing that my crusade against the physical abuse of patients thus
far had proved of no avail, I determined to go over the heads of the
doctors and appeal to the ex-officio head of the institution, the
Governor of the State.

On March 12th, 1903, I wrote a letter which so disturbed the Governor
that he immediately set about an informal investigation of some of my
charges. Despite its prolixity, its unconventional form and what, under
other circumstances, would be characterized as almost diabolic
impudence and familiarity, my letter, as he said months later when I
talked with him, "rang true." The writing of it was an easy matter; in
fact, so easy, because of the pressure of truth under which I was
laboring at the time, that it embodied a compelling spontaneity.

The mailing of it was not so easy. I knew that the only sure way of
getting my thoughts before the Governor was to do my own mailing.
Naturally no doctor could be trusted to send an indictment against
himself and his colleagues to the one man in the State who had the
power to institute such an investigation as might make it necessary for
all to seek employment elsewhere. In my frame of mind, to wish to mail
my letter was to know how to accomplish the wish. The letter was in
reality a booklet. I had thoughtfully used waterproof India drawing ink
in writing it, in order, perhaps, that a remote posterity might not be
deprived of the document. The booklet consisted of thirty-two
eight-by-ten-inch pages of heavy white drawing paper. These I sewed
together. In planning the form of my letter I had forgotten to consider
the slot of a letter-box of average size. Therefore I had to adopt an
unusual method of getting the letter into the mails. My expedient was
simple. There was in the town a certain shop where I traded. At my
request the doctor gave me permission to go there for supplies. I was
of course accompanied by an attendant, who little suspected what was
under my vest. To conceal and carry my letter in that place had been
easy; but to get rid of it after reaching my goal was another matter.
Watching my opportunity, I slipped the missive between the leaves of a
copy of the _Saturday Evening Post_. This I did, believing that some
purchaser would soon discover the letter and mail it. Then I left the
shop.

On the back of the wrapper I had endorsed the following words:

    "Mr. Postmaster: This package is unsealed. Nevertheless it is
    first-class matter. Everything I write is necessarily first class.
    I have affixed two two-cent stamps. If extra postage is needed you
    will do the Governor a favor if you will put the extra postage on.
    Or affix 'due' stamps, and let the Governor pay his own bills, as
    he can well afford to. If you want to know who I am, just ask his
    Excellency, and oblige,

    Yours truly,

    ?"

Flanking this notice, I had arrayed other forceful sentiments, as
follows--taken from statutes which I had framed for the occasion:

    "Any person finding letter or package--duly stamped and
    addressed--_must_ mail same as said letter or package is really
    in hands of the Government the moment the stamp is affixed."

And again:

    "Failure to comply with Federal Statute which forbids any one
    except addressee to open a letter renders one liable to imprisonment
    in State Prison."

My letter reached the Governor. One of the clerks at the shop in which
I left the missive found and mailed it. From him I afterwards learned
that my unique instructions had piqued his curiosity, as well as
compelled my wished-for action. Assuming that the reader's curiosity
may likewise have been piqued, I shall quote certain passages from this
four-thousand-word epistle of protest. The opening sentence read as
follows: "If you have had the courage to read the above" (referring to
an unconventional heading) "I hope you will read on to the end of this
epistle--thereby displaying real Christian fortitude and learning a few
facts which I think should be brought to your attention."

I then introduced myself, mentioning a few common friends, by way of
indicating that I was not without influential political connections,
and proceeded as follows: "I take pleasure in informing you that I am
in the Crazy Business and am holding my job down with ease and a fair
degree of grace. Being in the Crazy Business, I understand certain
phases of the business about which you know nothing. You as Governor
are at present 'head devil' in this 'hell,' though I know you are
unconsciously acting as 'His Majesty's' 1st Lieutenant."

I then launched into my arraignment of the treatment of the insane. The
method, I declared, was "wrong from start to finish. The abuses
existing here exist in every other institution of the kind in the
country. They are all alike--though some of them are of course worse
than others. Hell is hell the world over, and I might also add that
hell is only a great big bunch of disagreeable details anyway. That's
all an Insane Asylum is. If you don't believe it, just go crazy and
take up your abode here. In writing this letter I am laboring under no
mental excitement. I am no longer subjected to the abuses about which I
complain. I am well and happy. In fact I never was so happy as I am
now. Whether I am in perfect mental health or not, I shall leave for
you to decide. If I am insane to-day I hope I may never recover my
Reason."

First I assailed the management of the private institution where I had
been strait-jacketed and referred to "Jekyll-Hyde" as "Dr.----, M.D.
(Mentally Deranged)." Then followed an account of the strait-jacket
experience; then an account of abuses at the State Hospital. I
described in detail the most brutal assault that fell to my lot. In
summing up I said, "The attendants claimed next day that I had called
them certain names. Maybe I did--though I don't believe I did at all.
What of it? This is no young ladies' boarding school. Should a man be
nearly killed because he swears at attendants who swear like pirates? I
have seen at least fifteen men, many of them mental and physical
wrecks, assaulted just as brutally as I was, and usually without a
cause. I know that men's lives have been shortened by these brutal
assaults. And that is only a polite way of saying that murder has been
committed here." Turning next to the matter of the women's wards, I
said: "A patient in this ward--a man in his right mind, who leaves here
on Tuesday next--told me that a woman patient told him that she had
seen many a helpless woman dragged along the floor by her hair, and had
also seen them choked by attendants who used a wet towel as a sort of
garrote. I have been through the mill and believe every word of the
abuse. You will perhaps doubt it, as it seems impossible. Bear in mind,
though, that everything bad and disagreeable is possible in an Insane
Asylum."

It will be observed that I was shrewd enough to qualify a charge I
could not prove.

When I came to the matter of the Bull Pen, I wasted no words: "The Bull
Pen," I wrote, "is a pocket edition of the New York Stock Exchange
during a panic."

I next pointed out the difficulties a patient must overcome in mailing
letters: "It is impossible for any one to send a letter to you _via_
the office. The letter would be consigned to the waste-basket--unless
it was a particularly crazy letter--in which case it might reach you,
as you would then pay no attention to it. But a sane letter and a
_true_ letter, telling about the abuses which exist here would stand no
show of being mailed. The way in which mail is tampered with by the
medical staff is contemptible."

I then described my stratagem in mailing my letter to the Governor.
Discovering that I had left a page of my epistolary booklet blank, I drew
upon it a copy of Rembrandt's Anatomy Lesson, and under it wrote: "This
page was skipped by mistake. Had to fight fifty-three days to get writing
paper and I hate to waste any space--hence the masterpiece--drawn in
five minutes. Never drew a line till September 26 (last) and never took
lessons in my life. I think you will readily believe my statement."
Continuing in the same half-bantering vein, I said: "I intend to
immortalize all members of medical staff of State Hospital for
Insane--when I illustrate my Inferno, which, when written, will make
Dante's Divine Comedy look like a French Farce."

I then outlined my plans for reform: "Whether my suggestions meet with
approval or not," I wrote, "will not affect the result--though
opposition on your part would perhaps delay reforms. I have decided to
devote the next few years of my life to correcting abuses now in
existence in every asylum in this country. I know how these abuses can
be corrected and I intend--later on, when I understand the subject
better--to draw up a Bill of Rights for the Insane. Every State in the
Union will pass it, because it will be founded on the Golden Rule. I am
desirous of having the co-operation of the Governor of Connecticut, but
if my plans do not appeal to him I shall deal directly with his only
superior, the President of the United States. When Theodore Roosevelt
hears my story his blood will boil. I would write to him now, but I am
afraid he would jump in and correct abuses too quickly. And by doing it
too quickly too little good would be accomplished."

Waxing crafty, yet, as I believed, writing truth, I continued: "I need
money badly, and if I cared to, I could sell my information and
services to the _New York World_ or _New York Journal_ for a large
amount. But I do not intend to advertise Connecticut as a Hell-hole of
Iniquity, Insanity, and Injustice. If the facts appeared in the public
press at this time, Connecticut would lose caste with her sister
States. And they would profit by Connecticut's disgrace and correct the
abuses before they could be put on the rack. As these conditions
prevail throughout the country, there is no reason why Connecticut
should get all the abuse and criticism which would follow any such
revelation of disgusting abuse; such inhuman treatment of human wrecks.
If publicity is necessary to force you to act--and I am sure it will
not be necessary--I shall apply for a writ of habeas corpus, and, in
proving my sanity to a jury, I shall incidentally prove your own
incompetence. Permitting such a whirl-wind reformer to drag
Connecticut's disgrace into open court would prove your incompetence."

For several obvious reasons it is well that I did not at that time
attempt to convince a jury that I was mentally sound. The mere
outlining of my ambitious scheme for reform would have caused my
immediate return to the hospital. That scheme, however, was a sound and
feasible one, as later events have proved. But, taking hold of me, as
it did, while my imagination was at white heat, I was impelled to
attack my problem with compromising energy and, for a time, in a manner
so unconvincing as to obscure the essential sanity of my cherished
purpose.

I closed my letter as follows: "No doubt you will consider certain
parts of this letter rather 'fresh.' I apologize for any such passages
now, but, as I have an Insane License, I do not hesitate to say what I
think. What's the use when one is caged like a criminal?

"P.S. This letter is a confidential one--and is to be returned to the
writer upon demand."

The letter was eventually forwarded to my conservator and is now in my
possession.

As a result of my protest the Governor immediately interrogated the
superintendent of the institution where "Jekyll-Hyde" had tortured me.
Until he laid before the superintendent my charges against his
assistant, the doctor in authority had not even suspected that I had
been tortured. This superintendent took pride in his institution. He
was sensitive to criticism and it was natural that he should strive to
palliate the offence of his subordinate. He said that I was a most
troublesome patient, which was, indeed, the truth; for I had always a
way of my own for doing the things that worried those in charge of me.
In a word, I brought to bear upon the situation what I have previously
referred to as "an uncanny admixture of sanity."

The Governor did not meet the assistant physician who had maltreated
me. The reprimand, if there was to be any, was left to the
superintendent to administer.

In my letter to the Governor I had laid more stress upon the abuses to
which I had been subjected at this private institution than I had upon
conditions at the State Hospital where I was when I wrote to him. This
may have had some effect on the action he took, or rather failed to
take. At any rate, as to the State Hospital, no action was taken. Not
even a word of warning was sent to the officials, as I later learned;
for before leaving the institution I asked them.

Though my letter did not bring about an investigation, it was not
altogether without results. Naturally, it was with considerable
satisfaction that I informed the doctors that I had outwitted them, and
it was with even greater satisfaction that I now saw those in authority
make a determined, if temporary, effort to protect helpless patients
against the cruelties of attendants. The moment the doctors were
convinced that I had gone over their heads and had sent a
characteristic letter of protest to the Governor of the State, that
moment they began to protect themselves with an energy born of a
realization of their former shortcomings. Whether or not the management
in question ever admitted that their unwonted activity was due to my
successful stratagem, the fact remains that the summary discharge of
several attendants accused and proved guilty of brutality immediately
followed and for a while put a stop to wanton assaults against which
for a period of four months I had protested in vain. Patients who still
lived in the violent ward told me that comparative peace reigned about
this time.




XXVII


My failure to force the Governor to investigate conditions at the State
Hospital convinced me that I could not hope to prosecute my reforms
until I should regain my liberty and re-establish myself in my old
world. I therefore quitted the role of reformer-militant; and, but for
an occasional outburst of righteous indignation at some flagrant abuse
which obtruded itself upon my notice, my demeanor was that of one quite
content with his lot in life.

I was indeed content--I was happy. Knowing that I should soon regain my
freedom, I found it easy to forgive--taking great pains not to
forget--any injustice which had been done me. Liberty is sweet, even to
one whose appreciation of it has never been augmented by its temporary
loss. The pleasurable emotions which my impending liberation aroused
within me served to soften my speech and render me more tractable. This
change the assistant physician was not slow to note, though he was
rather slow in placing in me the degree of confidence which I felt I
deserved. So justifiable, however, was his suspicion that even at the
time I forgave him for it. I had on so many prior occasions "played
possum" that the doctor naturally attributed complex and unfathomable
motives to my most innocent acts. For a long time he seemed to think
that I was trying to capture his confidence, win the privilege of an
unlimited parole, and so effect my escape. Doubtless he had not
forgotten the several plans for escape which I had dallied with and
bragged about while in the violent ward.

Though I was granted considerable liberty during the months of April,
May, and June, 1903, not until July did I enjoy a so-called unlimited
parole which enabled me to walk about the neighboring city unattended.
My privileges were granted so gradually that these first tastes of
regained freedom, though delightful, were not so thrilling as one might
imagine. I took everything as a matter of course, and, except when I
deliberately analyzed my feelings, was scarcely conscious of my former
deprivations.

This power to forget the past--or recall it only at will--has
contributed much to my happiness. Some of those who have suffered
experiences such as mine are prone to brood upon them, and I cannot but
attribute my happy immunity from unpleasant memories to the fact that I
have viewed my own case much as a physician might view that of a
patient. My past is a thing apart. I can examine this or that phase of
it in the clarifying and comforting light of reason, under a memory
rendered somewhat microscopic. And I am further compensated by the
belief that I have a distinct mission in life--a chance for usefulness
that might never have been mine had I enjoyed unbroken health and
uninterrupted liberty.

The last few months of my life in the hospital were much alike, save
that each succeeding one brought with it an increased amount of
liberty. My hours now passed pleasantly. Time did not drag, for I was
engaged upon some enterprise every minute. I would draw, read, write,
or talk. If any feeling was dominant, it was my feeling for art; and I
read with avidity books on the technique of that subject. Strange as it
may seem, however, the moment I again found myself in the world of
business my desire to become an artist died almost as suddenly as it
had been born. Though my artistic ambition was clearly an outgrowth of
my abnormal condition, and languished when normality asserted itself, I
am inclined to believe I should even now take a lively interest in the
study of art if I were so situated as to be deprived of a free choice
of my activities. The use of words later enthralled me because so
eminently suited to my purposes.

During the summer of 1903, friends and relatives often called to see
me. The talks we had were of great and lasting benefit to me. Though I
had rid myself of my more extravagant and impossible delusions of
grandeur--flying-machines and the like--I still discussed with intense
earnestness other schemes, which, though allied to delusions of
grandeur, were, in truth, still more closely allied to sanity itself.
My talk was of that high, but perhaps suspicious type in which
Imagination overrules Common Sense. Lingering delusions, as it were,
made great projects seem easy. That they were at least feasible under
certain conditions, my mentors admitted. Only I was in an abnormal
hurry to produce results. Work that I later realized could not be
accomplished in less than five or ten years, if, indeed, in a lifetime,
I then believed could be accomplished in a year or two, and by me
single-handed. Had I had none but mentally unbalanced people to talk
with, I might have continued to cherish a distorted perspective. It was
the unanimity of sane opinions that helped me to correct my own views;
and I am confident that each talk with relatives and friends hastened
my return to normality.

Though I was not discharged from the State Hospital until September
10th, 1903, during the preceding month I visited my home several times,
once for three days. These trips were not only interesting, but
steadying in effect. I willingly returned to the hospital when my
parole expired. Though several friends expressed surprise at this
willingness to enter again an institution where I had experienced so
many hardships, to me my temporary return was not in the least irksome.
As I had penetrated and conquered the mysteries of that dark side of
life, it no longer held any terrors for me. Nor does it to this day. I
can contemplate the future with a greater degree of complacency than
can some of those whose lot in life has been uniformly fortunate. In
fact, I said at that time that, should my condition ever demand it, I
would again enter a hospital for the insane, quite as willingly as the
average person now enters a hospital for the treatment of bodily
ailments.

It was in this complacent and confident mood, and without any sharp
line of transition, that I again began life in my old world of
companionship and of business.




XXVIII


For the first month of regained freedom I remained at home. These weeks
were interesting. Scarcely a day passed that I did not meet several
former friends and acquaintances who greeted me as one risen from the
dead. And well they might, for my three-year trip among the
worlds--rather than around the world--was suggestive of complete
separation from the everyday life of the multitude. One profound
impression which I received at this time was of the uniform delicacy of
feeling exhibited by my well-wishers. In no instance that I can recall
was a direct reference made to the nature of my recent illness, until I
had first made some remark indicating that I was not averse to
discussing it. There was an evident effort on the part of friends and
acquaintances to avoid a subject which they naturally supposed I wished
to forget. Knowing that their studied avoidance of a delicate subject
was inspired by a thoughtful consideration, rather than a lack of
interest, I invariably forced the conversation along a line calculated
to satisfy a suppressed, but perfectly proper, curiosity which I seldom
failed to detect. My decision to stand on my past and look the future
in the face has, I believe, contributed much to my own happiness, and,
more than anything else, enabled my friends to view my past as I myself
do. By frankly referring to my illness, I put my friends and
acquaintances at ease, and at a stroke rid them of that constraint
which one must feel in the presence of a person constantly in danger of
being hurt by a chance allusion to an unhappy occurrence.

I have said much about the obligation of the sane in reference to
easing the burdens of those committed to institutions. I might say
almost as much about the attitude of the public toward those who
survive such a period of exile, restored, but branded with a suspicion
which only time can efface. Though a former patient receives personal
consideration, he finds it difficult to obtain employment. No
fair-minded man can find fault with this condition of affairs, for an
inherent dread of insanity leads to distrust of one who has had a
mental breakdown. Nevertheless, the attitude is mistaken. Perhaps one
reason for this lack of confidence is to be found in the lack of
confidence which a former patient often feels in himself. Confidence
begets confidence, and those men and women who survive mental illness
should attack their problem as though their absence had been occasioned
by any one of the many circumstances which may interrupt the career of
a person whose mind has never been other than sound. I can testify to
the efficacy of this course, for it is the one I pursued. And I think
that I have thus far met with as great a degree of success as I might
have reasonably expected had my career never been all but fatally
interrupted.

Discharged from the State Hospital in September, 1903, late in October
of that same year I went to New York. Primarily my purpose was to study
art. I even went so far as to gather information regarding the several
schools; and had not my artistic ambition taken wing, I might have
worked for recognition in a field where so many strive in vain. But my
business instinct, revivified by the commercially surcharged atmosphere
of New York, soon gained sway, and within three months I had secured a
position with the same firm for which I had worked when I first went to
New York six years earlier. It was by the merest chance that I made
this most fortunate business connection. By no stretch of my rather
elastic imagination can I even now picture a situation that would, at
one and the same time, have so perfectly afforded a means of
livelihood, leisure in which to indulge my longing to write the story
of my experiences, and an opportunity to further my humanitarian
project.

Though persons discharged from mental hospitals are usually able to
secure, without much difficulty, work as unskilled laborers, or
positions where the responsibility is slight, it is often next to
impossible for them to secure positions of trust. During the
negotiations which led to my employment, I was in no suppliant mood. If
anything, I was quite the reverse; and as I have since learned, I
imposed terms with an assurance so sublime that any less degree of
audacity might have put an end to the negotiations then and there. But
the man with whom I was dealing was not only broad-minded, he was
sagacious. He recognized immediately such an ability to take care of my
own interests as argued an ability to protect those of his firm. But
this alone would not have induced the average business man to employ me
under the circumstances. It was the common-sense and rational attitude
of my employer toward mental illness which determined the issue. This
view, which is, indeed, exceptional to-day, will one day (within a few
generations, I believe) be too commonplace to deserve special mention.
As this man tersely expressed it: "When an employé is ill, he's ill,
and it makes no difference to me whether he goes to a general hospital
or a hospital for the insane. Should you ever find yourself in need of
treatment or rest, I want you to feel that you can take it when and
where you please, and work for us again when you are able."

Dealing almost exclusively with bankers, for that was the nature of my
work, I enjoyed almost as much leisure for reading and trying to learn
how to write as I should have enjoyed had I had an assured income that
would have enabled me to devote my entire time to these pursuits. And
so congenial did my work prove, and so many places of interest did I
visit, that I might rather have been classed as a "commercial tourist"
than as a commercial traveler. To view almost all of the natural
wonders and places of historic interest east of the Mississippi, and
many west of it; to meet and know representative men and women; to
enjoy an almost uninterrupted leisure, and at the same time earn a
livelihood--these advantages bear me out in the feeling that in
securing the position I did, at the time I did, I enjoyed one of those
rare compensations which Fate sometimes bestows upon those who survive
unusual adversity.




XXIX


After again becoming a free man, my mind would not abandon the
miserable ones whom I had left behind. I thought with horror that my
reason had been threatened and baffled at every turn. Without malice
toward those who had had me in charge, I yet looked with abhorrence
upon the system by which I had been treated. But I realized that I
could not successfully advocate reforms in hospital management until I
had first proved to relatives and friends my ability to earn a living.
And I knew that, after securing a position in the business world, I
must first satisfy my employers before I could hope to persuade others
to join me in prosecuting the reforms I had at heart. Consequently,
during the first year of my renewed business activity (the year 1904),
I held my humanitarian project in abeyance and gave all my executive
energy to my business duties. During the first half of that year I gave
but little time to reading and writing, and none at all to drawing. In
a tentative way, however, I did occasionally discuss my project with
intimate friends; but I spoke of its consummation as a thing of the
uncertain future. At that time, though confident of accomplishing my
set purpose, I believed I should be fortunate if my projected book were
published before my fortieth year. That I was able to publish it eight
years earlier was due to one of those unlooked for combinations of
circumstances which sometimes cause a hurried change of plans.

Late in the autumn of 1904, a slight illness detained me for two weeks
in a city several hundred miles from home. The illness itself amounted
to little, and, so far as I know, had no direct bearing on later
results, except that, in giving me an enforced vacation, it afforded me
an opportunity to read several of the world's great books. One of these
was "Les Misérables." It made a deep impression on me, and I am
inclined to believe it started a train of thought which gradually grew
into a purpose so all-absorbing that I might have been overwhelmed by
it, had not my over-active imagination been brought to bay by another's
common sense. Hugo's plea for suffering Humanity--for the world's
miserable--struck a responsive chord within me. Not only did it revive
my latent desire to help the afflicted; it did more. It aroused a
consuming desire to emulate Hugo himself, by writing a book which
should arouse sympathy for and interest in that class of unfortunates
in whose behalf I felt it my peculiar right and duty to speak. I
question whether any one ever read "Les Misérables" with keener
feeling. By day I read the story until my head ached; by night I
dreamed of it.

To resolve to write a book is one thing; to write it--fortunately for
the public--is quite another. Though I wrote letters with ease, I soon
discovered that I knew nothing of the vigils or methods of writing a
book. Even then I did not attempt to predict just when I should begin
to commit my story to paper. But, a month later, a member of the firm
in whose employ I was made a remark which acted as a sudden spur. One
day, while discussing the business situation with me, he informed me
that my work had convinced him that he had made no mistake in
re-employing me when he did. Naturally I was pleased. I had vindicated
his judgment sooner than I had hoped. Aside from appreciating and
remembering his compliment, at the time I paid no more attention to it.
Not until a fortnight later did the force of his remark exert any
peculiar influence on my plans. During that time it apparently
penetrated to some subconscious part of me--a part which, on prior
occasions, had assumed such authority as to dominate my whole being.
But, in this instance, the part that became dominant did not exert an
unruly or even unwelcome influence. Full of interest in my business
affairs one week, the next I not only had no interest in them, but I
had begun even to dislike them. From a matter-of-fact man of business I
was transformed into a man whose all-absorbing thought was the
amelioration of suffering among the afflicted insane. Travelling on
this high plane of ideal humanitarianism, I could get none but a
distorted and dissatisfying view of the life I must lead if I should
continue to devote my time to the comparatively deadening routine of
commercial affairs.

Thus it was inevitable that I should focus my attention on my
humanitarian project. During the last week of December I sought
ammunition by making a visit to two of the institutions where I had
once been a patient. I went there to discuss certain phases of the
subject of reform with the doctors in authority. I was politely
received and listened to with a degree of deference which was, indeed,
gratifying. Though I realized that I was rather intense on the subject
of reform, I did not have that clear insight into my state of mind
which the doctors had. Indeed, I believe that only those expert in the
detection of symptoms of a slightly disturbed mental condition could
possibly have observed anything abnormal about me at that time. Only
when I discussed my fond project of reform did I betray an abnormal
stress of feeling. I could talk as convincingly about business as I had
at any time in my life; for even at the height of this wave of
enthusiasm I dealt at length with a certain banker who finally placed
with my employers a large contract.

After conferring with the doctors, or rather--as it proved--exhibiting
myself to them, I returned to New Haven and discussed my project with
the President of Yale University. He listened patiently--he could
scarcely do otherwise--and did me the great favor of interposing his
judgment at a time when I might have made a false move. I told him that
I intended to visit Washington at once, to enlist the aid of President
Roosevelt; also that of Mr. Hay, Secretary of State. Mr. Hadley
tactfully advised me not to approach them until I had more thoroughly
crystallized my ideas. His wise suggestion I had the wisdom to adopt.

The next day I went to New York, and on January 1st, 1905, I began to
write. Within two days I had written about fifteen thousand words--for
the most part on the subject of reforms and how to effect them. One of
the documents prepared at that time contained grandiloquent passages
that were a portent of coming events--though I was ignorant of the
fact. In writing about my project I said, "Whether I am a tool of God
or a toy of the devil, time alone will tell; but there will be no
misunderstanding Time's answer if I succeed in doing one-tenth of the
good things I hope to accomplish.... Anything which is feasible in this
philanthropic age can easily be put into practice.... A listener gets
the impression that I hope to do a hundred years' work in a day. They
are wrong there, for I'm not so in love with work--as such. I would
like though to interest so many people in the accomplishment of my
purpose that one hundred years' work might be done in a fraction of
that time. Hearty co-operation brings quick results, and once you start
a wave of enthusiasm in a sea of humanity, and have for the base of
that wave a humanitarian project of great breadth, it will travel with
irresistible and ever-increasing impulse to the ends of the
earth--which is far enough. According to Dr. ----, many of my ideas
regarding the solution of the problem under consideration are years and
years in advance of the times. I agree with him, but that is no reason
why we should not put 'the times' on board the express train of
progress and give civilization a boost to a higher level, until it
finally lands on a plateau where performance and perfection will be
synonymous terms."

Referring to the betterment of conditions, I said, "And this
improvement can never be brought about without some central
organization by means of which the best ideas in the world may be
crystallized and passed along to those in charge of this army of
afflicted ones. The methods to be used to bring about these results
must be placed on the same high level as the idea itself. No yellow
journalism or other sensational means should be resorted to. Let the
thing be worked up secretly and confidentially by a small number of men
who know their business. Then when the very best plan has been
formulated for the accomplishment of the desired results, and men of
money have been found to support the movement until it can take care of
itself, announce to the world in a dignified and effective manner the
organization and aims of the society, the name of which shall be--,
decided later.... To start the movement will not require a whole lot of
money. It will be started modestly and as financial resources of the
society increase, the field will be broadened." ... "The abuses and
correction of same is a mere detail in the general scheme." ... "It is
too early to try to interest anyone in this scheme of preventing
breakdowns, as there are other things of more importance to be brought
about first--but it will surely come in time."

"'Uncle Tom's Cabin,'" I continued, "had a very decided effect on the
question of slavery of the negro race. Why cannot a book be written
which will free the helpless slaves of all creeds and colors confined
to-day in the asylums and sanitariums throughout the world? That is,
free them from unnecessary abuses to which they are now subjected. Such
a book, I believe, can be written and I trust that I may be permitted
to live till I am wise enough to write it. Such a book might change the
attitude of the public towards those who are unfortunate enough to have
the stigma of mental incompetency put upon them. Of course, an insane
man is an insane man and while insane should be placed in an
institution for treatment, but when that man comes out he should be as
free from all taint as the man is who recovers from a contagious
disease and again takes his place in society." In conclusion, I said,
"From a scientific point of view there is a great field for
research.... Cannot some of the causes be discovered and perhaps done
away with, thereby saving the lives of many--and millions in money? It
may come about that some day something will be found which will prevent
a complete and incurable mental breakdown...."

Thus did I, as revealed by these rather crude, unrevised quotations,
somewhat prophetically, if extravagantly, box the compass that later
guided the ship of my hopes (not one of my phantom ships) into a safe
channel, and later into a safe harbor.

By way of mental diversion during these creative days at the Yale Club,
I wrote personal letters to intimate friends. One of these produced a
result unlooked for. There were about it compromising earmarks which
the friend to whom it was sent recognized. In it I said that I intended
to approach a certain man of wealth and influence who lived in New
York, with a view to securing some action that would lead to reform.
That was enough. My friend showed the letter to my brother--the one who
had acted as my conservator. He knew at once that I was in an excited
mental condition. But he could not very well judge the degree of the
excitement; for when I had last talked with him a week earlier, I had
not discussed my larger plans. Business affairs and my hope for
business advancement had then alone interested me.

I talked with President Hadley on Friday; Saturday I went to New York;
Sunday and Monday I spent at the Yale Club, writing; Tuesday, this
telltale letter fell under the prescient eye of my brother. On that day
he at once got in touch with me by telephone. We briefly discussed the
situation. He did not intimate that he believed me to be in elation. He
simply urged me not to attempt to interest anyone in my project until I
had first returned to New Haven and talked with him. Now I had already
gone so far as to invite my employers to dine with me that very night
at the Yale Club for the purpose of informing them of my plans. This I
did, believing it to be only fair that they should know what I intended
to do, so that they might dispense with my services should they feel
that my plans would in any way impair my usefulness as an employé. Of
this dinner engagement, therefore, I told my brother. But so
insistently did he urge me to defer any such conference as I proposed
until I had talked with him that, although it was too late to break the
dinner engagement, I agreed to avoid, if possible, any reference to my
project. I also agreed to return home the next day.

That night my guests honored me as agreed. For an hour or two we
discussed business conditions and affairs in general. Then, one of them
referred pointedly to my implied promise to unburden myself on a
certain subject, the nature of which he did not at the time know. I
immediately decided that it would be best to "take the bull by the
horns," submit my plans, and, if necessary, sever my connection with
the firm, should its members force me to choose (as I put it) between
themselves and Humanity. I then proceeded to unfold my scheme; and,
though I may have exhibited a decided intensity of feeling during my
discourse, at no time, I believe, did I overstep the bounds of what
appeared to be sane enthusiasm. My employers agreed that my purpose was
commendable--that no doubt I could and would eventually be able to do
much for those I had left behind in a durance I so well knew to be
vile. Their one warning was that I seemed in too great a hurry. They
expressed the opinion that I had not been long enough re-established in
business to be able to persuade people of wealth and influence to take
hold of my project. And one of my guests very aptly observed that I
could not afford to be a philanthropist, which objection I met by
saying that all I intended to do was to supply ideas for those who
could afford to apply them. The conference ended satisfactorily. My
employers disclaimed any personal objection to my proceeding with my
project, if I would, and yet remaining in their employ. They simply
urged me to "go slow." "Wait until you're forty," one of them said. I
then thought that I might do so. And perhaps I should have waited so
long, had not the events of the next two days put me on the right road
to an earlier execution of my cherished plans.

The next day, January 4th, true to my word, I went home. That night I
had a long talk with my brother. I did not suspect that a man like
myself, capable of dealing with bankers and talking for several
consecutive hours with his employers without arousing their suspicion
as to his mental condition, was to be suspected by his own relatives.
Nor, indeed, with the exception of my brother, who had read my
suspiciously excellent letter, were any of my relatives disturbed; and
he did nothing to disabuse my assurance. After our night conference he
left for his own home, casually mentioning that he would see me again
the next morning. That pleased me, for I was in a talkative mood and
craved an interested listener.

When my brother returned the next morning, I willingly accepted his
invitation to go with him to his office, where we could talk without
fear of interruption. Arrived there, I calmly sat down and prepared to
prove my whole case. I had scarcely "opened fire" when in walked a
stranger--a strapping fellow, to whom my brother immediately introduced
me. I instinctively felt that it was by no mere chance that this third
party had so suddenly appeared. My eyes at once took in the dark blue
trousers worn by the otherwise conventionally dressed stranger. That
was enough. The situation became so clear that the explanations which
followed were superfluous. In a word, I was under arrest, or in
imminent danger of being arrested. To say that I was not in the least
disconcerted would scarcely be true, for I had not divined my brother's
clever purpose in luring me to his office. But I can say, with truth,
that I was the coolest person in the room. I knew what I should do
next, but my brother and the officer of the law could only guess. The
fact is I did nothing. I calmly remained seated, awaiting the verdict
which I well knew my brother, with characteristic decision, had already
prepared. With considerable effort--for the situation, he has since
told me, was the most trying one of his life--he informed me that on
the preceding day he had talked with the doctors to whom I had so
opportunely exhibited myself a week earlier. All agreed that I was in a
state of elation which might or might not become more pronounced. They
had advised that I be persuaded to submit voluntarily to treatment in a
hospital, or that I be, if necessary, forcibly committed. On this
advice my brother had proceeded to act. And it was well so; for, though
I appreciated the fact that I was by no means in a normal state of
mind, I had not a clear enough insight into my condition to realize
that treatment and a restricted degree of liberty were what I needed,
since continued freedom might further inflame an imagination already
overwrought.

A few simple statements by my brother convinced me that it was for my
own good and the peace of mind of my relatives that I should
temporarily surrender my freedom. This I agreed to do. Perhaps the
presence of two hundred pounds of brawn and muscle, representing the
law, lent persuasiveness to my brother's words. In fact, I did assent
the more readily because I admired the thorough, sane, fair, almost
artistic manner in which my brother had brought me to bay. I am
inclined to believe that, had I suspected that a recommitment was
imminent, I should have fled to a neighboring State during the
preceding night. Fortunately, however, the right thing was done in the
right way at the right time. Though I had been the victim of a clever
stratagem, not for one moment thereafter, in any particular, was I
deceived. I was frankly told that several doctors had pronounced me
elated, and that for my own good I _must_ submit to treatment. I was
allowed to choose between a probate court commitment which would have
"admitted me" to the State Hospital, or a "voluntary commitment" which
would enable me to enter the large private hospital where I had
previously passed from depression to elation, and had later suffered
tortures. I naturally chose the more desirable of the two disguised
blessings, and agreed to start at once for the private hospital, the
one in which I had been when depression gave way to elation. It was not
that I feared again to enter the State Hospital. I simply wished to
avoid the publicity which necessarily would have followed, for at that
time the statutes of Connecticut did not provide for voluntary
commitment to the state hospitals. Then, too, there were certain
privileges which I knew I could not enjoy in a public institution.
Having re-established myself in society and business I did not wish to
forfeit that gain; and as the doctors believed that my period of
elation would be short, it would have been sheer folly to advertise the
fact that my mental health had again fallen under suspicion.

But before starting for the hospital I imposed certain conditions. One
was that the man with the authoritative trousers should walk behind at
such a distance that no friend or acquaintance who might see my brother
and myself would suspect that I was under guard; the other was that the
doctors at the institution should agree to grant my every request, no
matter how trivial, so long as doing so could in no way work to my own
injury. My privileges were to include that of reading and writing to my
heart's content, and the procuring of such books and supplies as my
fancy might dictate. All this was agreed to. In return I agreed to
submit to the surveillance of an attendant when I went outside the
hospital grounds. This I knew would contribute to the peace of mind of
my relatives, who naturally could not rid themselves of the fear that
one so nearly normal as myself might take it into his head to leave the
State and resist further attempts at control. As I felt that I could
easily elude my keeper, should I care to escape, his presence also
contributed to _my_ peace of mind, for I argued that the ability to
outwit my guard would atone for the offence itself.

I then started for the hospital; and I went with a willingness
surprising even to myself. A cheerful philosophy enabled me to turn an
apparently disagreeable situation into one that was positively pleasing
to me. I convinced myself that I could extract more real enjoyment from
life during the ensuing weeks within the walls of a "retreat" than I
could in the world outside. My one desire was to write, write, write.
My fingers itched for a pen. My desire to write was, I imagine, as
irresistible as is the desire of a drunkard for his dram. And the act
of writing resulted in an intoxicating pleasure composed of a mingling
of emotions that defies analysis.

That I should so calmly, almost eagerly, enter where devils might fear
to tread may surprise the reader who already has been informed of the
cruel treatment I had formerly received there. I feared nothing, for I
knew all. Having seen the worst, I knew how to avoid the pitfalls into
which, during my first experience at that hospital, I had fallen or
deliberately walked. I was confident that I should suffer no abuse or
injustice so long as the doctors in charge should live up to their
agreement and treat me with unvarying fairness. This they did, and my
quick recovery and subsequent discharge may be attributed partly to
this cause. The assistant physicians who had come in contact with me
during my first experience in this hospital were no longer there. They
had resigned some months earlier, shortly after the death of the former
superintendent. Thus it was that I started with a clean record, free
from those prejudices which so often affect the judgment of a hospital
physician who has treated a mental patient at his worst.




XXX


On more than one occasion my chameleonlike temperament has enabled me
to adjust myself to new conditions, but never has it served me better
than it did at the time of which I write. A free man on New Year's Day,
enjoying the pleasures of a congenial club life, four days later I
found myself again under the lock and key of an institution for the
insane. Never had I enjoyed life in New York more than during those
first days of that new year. To suffer so rude a change was, indeed,
enough to arouse a feeling of discontent, if not despair; yet, aside
from the momentary initial shock, my contentment was in no degree
diminished. I can say with truth that I was as complacent the very
moment I recrossed the threshold of that "retreat" as I had been when
crossing and recrossing at will the threshold of my club.

Of everything I thought and did during the interesting weeks which
followed, I have a complete record. The moment I accepted the
inevitable, I determined to spend my time to good advantage. Knowing
from experience that I must observe my own case, if I was to have any
detailed record of it, I provided myself in advance with notebooks. In
these I recorded, I might almost say, my every thought and action. The
sane part of me, which fortunately was dominant, subjected its
temporarily unruly part to a sort of scientific scrutiny and
surveillance. From morning till night I dogged the steps of my restless
body and my more restless imagination. I observed the physical and
mental symptoms which I knew were characteristic of elation. An
exquisite light-heartedness, an exalted sense of wellbeing, my pulse,
my weight, my appetite--all these I observed and recorded with a care
that would have put to the blush a majority of the doctors in charge of
mental cases in institutions.

But this record of symptoms, though minute, was vague compared to my
reckless analysis of my emotions. With a lack of reserve characteristic
of my mood, I described the joy of living, which, for the most part,
then consisted in the joy of writing. And even now, when I reread my
record, I feel that I cannot overstate the pleasure I found in
surrendering myself completely to that controlling impulse. The
excellence of my composition seemed to me beyond criticism. And, as to
one in a state of elation, things are pretty much as they seem, I was
able to experience the subtle delights which, I fancy, thrill the soul
of a master. During this month of elation I wrote words enough to fill
a book nearly as large as this one. Having found that each filling of
my fountain pen was sufficient for the writing of about twenty-eight
hundred words, I kept a record of the number of times I filled it. This
minute calculation I carried to an extreme. If I wrote for fifty-nine
minutes, and then read for seventeen, those facts I recorded. Thus, in
my diary and out of it, I wrote and wrote until the tips of my thumb
and forefinger grew numb. As this numbness increased and general
weariness of the hand set in, there came a gradual flagging of my
creative impulse until a very normal unproductivity supervened.

The reader may well wonder in what my so-called insanity at this time
consisted. Had I any of those impracticable delusions which had
characterized my former period of elation? No, not one--unless an
unreasonable haste to achieve my ambitions may be counted a delusion.
My attention simply focussed itself on my project. All other
considerations seemed of little moment. My interest in business waned
to the vanishing point. Yet one thing should be noted: I did
deliberately devote many hours to the consideration of business
affairs. Realizing that one way to overcome an absorbing impulse is to
divide the attention, I wrote a brief of the arguments I had often used
when talking with bankers. In this way I was able to convince the
doctors that my intense interest in literature and reform would soon
spend itself.

A consuming desire to effect reforms had been the determining factor
when I calmly weighed the situation with a view to making the best
possible use of my impulse to write. The events of the immediate past
had convinced me that I could not hope to interest people of wealth and
influence in my humanitarian project until I had some definite plan to
submit for their leisurely consideration. Further, I had discovered
that an attempt to approach them directly disturbed my relatives and
friends, who had not yet learned to dissociate! present intentions from
past performances. I had, therefore, determined to drill myself in the
art of composition to the end that I might write a story of my life
which would merit publication. I felt that such a book, once written,
would do its own work, regardless of my subsequent fortunes. Other
books had spoken even from the grave; why should not my book so
speak--if necessary?

With this thought in mind I began not only to read and write, but to
test my impulse in order that I might discover if it were a part of my
very being, an abnormal impulse, or a mere whim. I reasoned that to
compare my own feelings toward literature, and my emotions experienced
in the heat of composition, with the recorded feelings of successful
men of letters, would give me a clue to the truth on this question. At
this time I read several books that could have served as a basis for my
deductions, but only one of them did I have time to analyze and note in
my diary. That one was, "Wit and Wisdom of the Earl of Beaconsfield."
The following passages from the pen of Disraeli I transcribed in my
diary with occasional comment.

"Remember who you are, and also that it is your duty to excel.
Providence has given you a great lot. Think ever that you are born to
perform great duties." This I interpreted in much the same spirit that
I had interpreted the 45th Psalm on an earlier occasion.

"It was that noble ambition, the highest and best, that must be born in
the heart, and organized in the brain, which will not let a man be
content unless his intellectual power is recognized by his race, and
desires that it should contribute to their welfare."

"Authors--the creators of opinion."

"What appear to be calamities are often the sources of fortune."

"Change is inevitable in a progressive country. Change is constant."
("Then why," was my recorded comment, "cannot the changes I propose to
bring about, be brought about?")

"The author is, as we must ever remember, of peculiar organization. He
is a being born with a predisposition which with him is irresistible,
the bent of which he cannot in any way avoid, whether it directs him to
the abstruse researches of erudition or induces him to mount into the
fervid and turbulent atmosphere of imagination."

"This," I wrote (the day after arriving at the hospital) "is a fair
diagnosis of my case as it stands to-day, assuming, of course, that an
author is one who loves to write, and can write with ease, even though
what he says may have no literary value. My past proves that my
organization is a peculiar one. I have for years (two and a half) had a
desire to achieve success along literary lines. I believe that, feeling
as I do to-day, nothing can prevent my writing. If I had to make a
choice at once between a sure success in the business career ahead of
me and doubtful success in the field of literature, I would willingly,
yes confidently, choose the latter. I have read many a time about
successful writers who learned how to write, and by dint of hard work
ground out their ideas. If these men could succeed, why should not a
man who is in danger of being ground up by an excess of ideas and
imagination succeed, when he seems able to put those ideas into fairly
intelligible English? He should and will succeed."

Therefore, without delay, I began the course of experiment and practice
which culminated within a few months in the first draft of my story.
Wise enough to realize the advantages of a situation free from the
annoying interruptions of the workaday world, I enjoyed a degree of
liberty seldom experienced by those in possession of complete legal
liberty and its attendant obligations. When I wished to read, write,
talk, walk, sleep, or eat, I did the thing I wished. I went to the
theatre when the spirit moved me to do so, accompanied, of course, by
an attendant, who on such occasions played the rôle of chum.

Friends called to see me and, at their suggestion or mine, invited me
to dinner outside the walls of my "cloister." At one of these dinners
an incident occurred which throws a clear light on my condition at the
time. The friend, whose willing prisoner I was, had invited a common
friend to join the party. The latter had not heard of my recent
commitment. At my suggestion, he who shared my secret had agreed not to
refer to it unless I first broached the subject. There was nothing
strange in the fact that we three should meet. Just such impromptu
celebrations had before occurred among us. We dined, and, as friends
will, indulged in that exchange of thoughts which bespeaks intimacy.
During our talk, I so shaped the conversation that the possibility of a
recurrence of my mental illness was discussed. The uninformed friend
derided the idea.

"Then, if I were to tell you," I remarked, "that I am at this moment
supposedly insane--at least not normal--and that when I leave you
to-night I shall go direct to the very hospital where I was formerly
confined, there to remain until the doctors pronounce me fit for
freedom, what would you say?"

"I should say that you are a choice sort of liar," he retorted.

This genial insult I swallowed with gratification. It was, in truth, a
timely and encouraging compliment, the force of which its author failed
to appreciate until my host had corroborated my statements.

If I could so favorably impress an intimate friend at a time when I was
elated, it is not surprising that I should subsequently hold an
interview with a comparative stranger--the cashier of a local
bank--without betraying my state of mind. As business interviews go,
this was in a class by itself. While my attendant stood guard at the
door, I, an enrolled inmate of a hospital for the insane, entered the
banking room and talked with a level-headed banker. And that interview
was not without effect in subsequent negotiations which led to the
closing of a contract amounting to one hundred and fifty thousand
dollars.

The very day I re-entered the hospital I stopped on the way at a local
hotel and procured some of the hostelry's stationery. By using this in
the writing of personal and business letters I managed to conceal my
condition and my whereabouts from all except near relatives and a few
intimate friends who shared the secret. I quite enjoyed leading this
legitimate double life. The situation appealed (not in vain) to my
sense of humor. Many a smile did I indulge in when I closed a letter
with such ambiguous phrases as the following: "Matters of importance
necessitate my remaining where I am for an indefinite period." ... "A
situation has recently arisen which will delay my intended trip South.
As soon as I have closed a certain contract (having in mind my contract
to re-establish my sanity) I shall again take to the road." To this day
few friends or acquaintances know that I was in semi-exile during the
month of January, 1905. My desire to suppress the fact was not due, as
already intimated, to any sensitiveness regarding the subject of
insanity. What afterwards justified my course was that on regaining my
freedom I was able, without embarrassment, again to take up my work.
Within a month of my voluntary commitment, that is, in February, I
started on a business trip through the Central West and South, where I
remained until the following July. During those months I felt perfectly
well, and have remained in excellent health ever since.

This second interruption of my career came at a time and in a manner to
furnish me with strong arguments wherewith to support my contention
that so-called madmen are too often man-made, and that he who is
potentially mad may keep a saving grip on his own reason if he be
fortunate enough to receive that kindly and intelligent treatment to
which one on the brink of mental chaos is entitled. Though during this
second period of elation I was never in a mood so reckless as that
which obtained immediately after my recovery from depression in August,
1902, I was at least so excitable that, had those in authority
attempted to impose upon me, I should have thrown discretion to the
winds. To them, indeed, I frankly reiterated a terse dictum which I had
coined during my first period of elation. "Just press the button of
Injustice," I said, "and I'll do the rest!" This I meant, for fear of
punishment does not restrain a man in the dare-devil grip of elation.

What fostered my self-control was a sense of gratitude. The doctors and
attendants treated me as a gentleman. Therefore it was not difficult to
prove myself one. My every whim was at least considered with a
politeness which enabled me to accept a denial with a highly sane
equanimity. Aside from mild tonics I took no other medicine than that
most beneficial sort which inheres in kindness. The feeling that,
though a prisoner, I could still command obligations from others led me
to recognize my own reciprocal obligations, and was a constant source
of delight. The doctors, by proving their title to that confidence
which I tentatively gave them upon re-entering the institution, had no
difficulty in convincing me that a temporary curtailment of some
privileges was for my own good. They all evinced a consistent desire to
trust me. In return I trusted them.




XXXI


On leaving the hospital and resuming my travels, I felt sure that any
one of several magazines or newspapers would willingly have had me
conduct my campaign under its nervously commercial auspices; but a
flash-in-the-pan method did not appeal to me. Those noxious growths,
Incompetence, Abuse, and Injustice, had not only to be cut down, but
rooted out. Therefore, I clung to my determination to write a book--an
instrument of attack which, if it cuts and sears at all, does so as
long as the need exists. Inasmuch as I knew that I still had to learn
how to write, I approached my task with deliberation. I planned to do
two things: first, to crystallize my thoughts by discussion--telling
the story of my life whenever in my travels I should meet any person
who inspired my confidence; second, while the subject matter of my book
was shaping itself in my mind, to drill myself by carrying on a
letter-writing campaign. Both these things I did--as certain indulgent
friends who bore the brunt of my spoken and written discourse can
certify. I feared the less to be dubbed a bore, and I hesitated the
less, perhaps, to impose upon good-nature, because of my firm
conviction that one in a position to help the many was himself entitled
to the help of the few.

I wrote scores of letters of great length. I cared little if some of my
friends should conclude that I had been born a century too late; for,
without them as confidants, I must write with no more inspiring object
in view than the wastebasket. Indeed, I found it difficult to compose
without keeping before me the image of a friend. Having stipulated that
every letter should be returned upon demand, I wrote without
reserve--my imagination had free rein. I wrote as I thought, and I
thought as I pleased. The result was that within six months I found
myself writing with a facility which hitherto had obtained only during
elation. At first I was suspicious of this new-found and apparently
permanent ease of expression--so suspicious that I set about diagnosing
my symptoms. My self-examination convinced me that I was, in fact,
quite normal. I had no irresistible desire to write, nor was there any
suggestion of that exalted, or (technically speaking) euphoric,
light-heartedness which characterizes elation. Further, after a
prolonged period of composition, I experienced a comforting sense of
exhaustion which I had not known while elated. I therefore
concluded--and rightly--that my unwonted facility was the product of
practice. At last I found myself able to conceive an idea and
immediately transfer it to paper effectively.

In July, 1905, I came to the conclusion that the time for beginning my
book was at hand. Nevertheless, I found it difficult to set a definite
date. About this time I so arranged my itinerary that I was able to
enjoy two summer--though stormy--nights and a day at the Summit House
on Mount Washington. What better, thought I, than to begin my book on a
plane so high as to be appropriate to this noble summit? I therefore
began to compose a dedication. "To Humanity" was as far as I got. There
the Muse forsook me.

But, returning to earth and going about my business, I soon again found
myself in the midst of inspiring natural surroundings--the Berkshire
Hills. At this juncture Man came to the assistance of Nature, and
perhaps with an unconsciousness equal to her own. It was a chance
remark made by an eminent man that aroused my subconscious literary
personality to irresistible action. I had long wished to discuss my
project with a man of great reputation, and if the reputation were
international, so much the better. I desired the unbiased opinion of a
judicial mind. Opportunely, I learned that the Hon. Joseph H. Choate
was then at his summer residence at Stockbridge, Massachusetts. Mr.
Choate had never heard of me and I had no letter of introduction. The
exigencies of the occasion, however, demanded that I conjure one up, so
I wrote my own letter of introduction and sent it:

    RED LION INN,
    STOCKBRIDGE, MASS.
    August 18, 1905.

    HON. JOSEPH H. CHOATE,
    Stockbridge, Massachusetts.

    DEAR SIR:

    Though I might present myself at your door, armed with one of
    society's unfair skeleton-keys--a letter of introduction--I prefer
    to approach you as I now do: simply as a young man who honestly
    feels entitled to at least five minutes of your time, and as many
    minutes more as you care to grant because of your interest in the
    subject to be discussed.

    I look to you at this time for your opinion as to the value of
    some ideas of mine, and the feasibility of certain schemes based
    on them.

    A few months ago I talked with President Hadley of Yale, and
    briefly outlined my plans. He admitted that many of them seemed
    feasible and would, if carried out, add much to the sum-total of
    human happiness. His only criticism was that they were "too
    comprehensive."

    Not until I have staggered an imagination of the highest type will
    I admit that I am trying to do too much. Should you refuse to see
    me, believe me when I tell you that you will still be, as you are
    at this moment, the unconscious possessor of my sincere respect.

    Business engagements necessitate my leaving here early on Monday
    next. Should you care to communicate with me, word sent in care of
    this hotel will reach me promptly.

    Yours very truly,

    CLIFFORD W. BEERS.

Within an hour I had received a reply, in which Mr. Choate said that he
would see me at his home at ten o'clock the next morning.

At the appointed time, the door, whose lock I had picked with a pen,
opened before me and I was ushered into the presence of Mr. Choate. He
was graciousness itself--but pointed significantly at a heap of
unanswered letters lying before him. I took the hint and within ten
minutes briefly outlined my plans. After pronouncing my project a
"commendable one," Mr. Choate offered the suggestion that produced
results. "If you will submit your ideas in writing," he said, "I shall
be glad to read your manuscript and assist you in any way I can. To
consider fully your scheme would require several hours, and busy men
cannot very well give you so much time. What they can do is to read
your manuscript during their leisure moments."

Thus it was that Mr. Choate, by granting the interview, contributed to
an earlier realization of my purposes. One week later I began the
composition of this book. My action was unpremeditated, as my quitting
Boston for less attractive Worcester proves. That very day, finding
myself with a day and a half of leisure before me, I decided to tempt
the Muse and compel myself to prove that my pen was, in truth, "the
tongue of a ready writer." A stranger in the city, I went to a school
of stenography and there secured the services of a young man who,
though inexperienced in his art, was more skilled in catching thoughts
as they took wing than I was at that time in the art of setting them
free. Except in the writing of one or two conventional business
letters, never before had I dictated to a stenographer. After I had
startled him into an attentive mood by briefly outlining my past career
and present purpose, I worked without any definite plan or brief, or
reference to data. My narrative was therefore digressive and only
roughly chronological. But it served to get my material in front of me
for future shaping. At this task I hammered away three or four hours a
day for a period of five weeks.

It so happened that Mr. Choate arrived at the same hotel on the day I
took up my abode there, so that some of the toil he had inspired went
on in his proximity, if not in his presence. I carefully kept out of
his sight, however, lest he should think me a "crank" on the subject of
reform, bent on persecuting his leisure.

As the work progressed my facility increased. In fact, I soon called in
an additional stenographer to help in the snaring of my thoughts. This
excessive productivity caused me to pause and again diagnose my
condition. I could not fail now to recognize in myself symptoms hardly
distinguishable from those which had obtained eight months earlier when
it had been deemed expedient temporarily to restrict my freedom. But I
had grown wise in adversity. Rather than interrupt my manuscript short
of completion I decided to avail myself of a vacation that was due, and
remain outside my native State--this, so that well-meaning but perhaps
overzealous relatives might be spared unnecessary anxiety, and I myself
be spared possible unwarranted restrictions. I was by no means certain
as to the degree of mental excitement that would result from such
continuous mental application; nor did I much care, so long as I
accomplished my task. However, as I knew that "possession is nine
points of the law," I decided to maintain my advantage by remaining in
my literary fortress. And my resolve was further strengthened by
certain cherished sentiments expressed by John Stuart Mill in his essay
"On Liberty," which I had read and reread with an interest born of
experience.

At last the first draft of the greater part of my story was completed.
After a timely remittance (for, in strict accordance with the
traditions of the craft, I had exhausted my financial resources) I
started for home with a sigh of relief. For months I had been under the
burden of a conscious obligation. My memory, stored with information
which, if rightly used, could, I believed, brighten and even save
unhappy lives, was to me as a basket of eggs which it was my duty to
balance on a head whose poise was supposed to be none too certain. One
by one, during the preceding five weeks, I had gently lifted my
thoughts from their resting-place, until a large part of my burden had
been so shifted as to admit of its being imposed upon the public
conscience.

After I had lived over again the trials and the tortures of my
unhappiest years--which was of course necessary in ploughing and
harrowing a memory happily retentive--the completion of this first
draft left me exhausted. But after a trip to New York, whither I went
to convince my employers that I should be granted a further
leave-of-absence, I resumed work. The ground for this added favor was
that my manuscript was too crude to submit to any but intimate
acquaintances. Knowing, perhaps, that a business man with a literary
bee buzzing in his ear is, for the time, no business man at all, my
employers readily agreed that I should do as I pleased during the month
of October. They also believed me entitled to the favor, recognizing
the force of my belief that I had a high obligation to discharge.

It was under the family rooftree that I now set up my literary shop.
Nine months earlier an unwonted interest in literature and reform had
sent me to an institution. That I should now in my own home be able to
work out my destiny without unduly disturbing the peace of mind of
relatives was a considerable satisfaction. In the very room where,
during June, 1900, my reason had set out for an unknown goal, I
redictated my account of that reason's experiences.

My leave-of-absence ended, I resumed my travels eagerly; for I wished
to cool my brain by daily contact with the more prosaic minds of men of
business. I went South. For a time I banished all thoughts of my book
and project. But after some months of this change of occupation, which
I thoroughly enjoyed, I found leisure in the course of wide travels to
take up the work of elaboration and revision. A presentable draft of my
story being finally prepared, I began to submit it to all sorts and
conditions of minds (in accordance with Mill's dictum that only in that
way can the truth be obtained). In my quest for criticism and advice, I
fortunately decided to submit my manuscript to Professor William James
of Harvard University, the most eminent of American psychologists and a
masterful writer, who was then living. He expressed interest in my
project; put my manuscript with others on his desk--but was somewhat
reserved when it came to promising to read my story. He said it might
be months before he could find time to do so. Within a fortnight,
however, I received from him a characteristic letter. To me it came as
a rescuing sun, after a period of groping about for an authoritative
opinion that should put scoffers to flight. The letter read as follows:

    95 IRVING ST., CAMBRIDGE, MASS.
    July 1, 1906.

    DEAR MR. BEERS:

    Having at last "got round" to your MS., I have read it with very
    great interest and admiration for both its style and its temper. I
    hope you will finish it and publish it. It is the best written out
    "case" that I have seen; and you no doubt have put your finger on
    the weak spots of our treatment of the insane, and suggested the
    right line of remedy. I have long thought that if I were a
    millionaire, with money to leave for public purposes, I should
    endow "Insanity" exclusively.

    You were doubtless a pretty intolerable character when the maniacal
    condition came on and you were bossing the universe. Not only
    ordinary "tact," but a genius for diplomacy must have been needed
    for avoiding rows with you; but you certainly were wrongly treated
    nevertheless; and the spiteful Assistant M.D. at ---- deserves to
    have his name published. Your report is full of instructiveness
    for doctors and attendants alike.

    The most striking thing in it to my mind is the sudden conversion
    of you from a delusional subject to a maniacal one--how the whole
    delusional system disintegrated the moment one pin was drawn out
    by your proving your brother to be genuine. I never heard of so
    rapid a change in a mental system.

    You speak of rewriting. Don't you do it. You can hardly improve
    your book. I shall keep the MS. a week longer as I wish to impart
    it to a friend.

    Sincerely yours,

    WM. JAMES.

Though Mr. James paid me the compliment of advising me not to rewrite
my original manuscript, I did revise it quite thoroughly before
publication. When my book was about to go to press for the first time
and since its reception by the public was problematical, I asked
permission to publish the letter already quoted. In reply, Mr. James
sent the following letter, also for publication.

    95 IRVING ST., CAMBRIDGE, MASS.
    November 10, 1907.

    DEAR MR. BEERS:

    You are welcome to use the letter I wrote to you (on July 1, 1906)
    after reading the first part of your MS. in any way your judgment
    prompts, whether as preface, advertisement, or anything else.
    Reading the rest of it only heightens its importance in my eyes.
    In style, in temper, in good taste, it is irreproachable. As for
    contents, it is fit to remain in literature as a classic account
    "from within" of an insane person's psychology.

    The book ought to go far toward helping along that terribly needed
    reform, the amelioration of the lot of the insane of our country,
    for the Auxiliary Society which you propose is feasible (as
    numerous examples in other fields show), and ought to work
    important effects on the whole situation.

    You have handled a difficult theme with great skill, and produced
    a narrative of absorbing interest to scientist as well as layman.
    It reads like fiction, but it is not fiction; and this I state
    emphatically, knowing how prone the uninitiated are to doubt the
    truthfulness of descriptions of abnormal mental processes.

    With best wishes for the success of the book and the plan, both of
    which, I hope, will prove epoch-making, I remain,

    Sincerely yours,

    WM. JAMES.

Several times in my narrative, I have said that the seemingly unkind
fate that robbed me of several probably happy and healthful years had
hidden within it compensations which have offset the sufferings and the
loss of those years. Not the least of the compensations has been the
many letters sent to me by eminent men and women, who, having achieved
results in their own work, are ever responsive to the efforts of anyone
trying to reach a difficult objective. Of all the encouraging opinions
I have ever received, one has its own niche in my memory. It came from
William James a few months before his death, and will ever be an
inspiration to me. Let my excuse for revealing so complimentary a
letter be that it justifies the hopes and aspirations expressed in the
course of my narrative, and shows them to be well on the way to
accomplishment.

    95 IRVING STREET, CAMBRIDGE,
    January 17, 1910.

    DEAR BEERS:

    Your exegesis of my farewell in my last note to you was erroneous,
    but I am glad it occurred, because it brought me the extreme
    gratification of your letter of yesterday.

    You are the most responsive and recognizant of human beings, my
    dear Beers, and it "sets me up immensely" to be treated by a
    practical man on practical grounds as you treat me. I inhabit such
    a realm of abstractions that I only get credit for what I do in
    that spectral empire; but you are not only a moral idealist and
    philanthropic enthusiast (and good fellow!), but a tip-top man of
    business in addition; and to have actually done anything that the
    like of you can regard as having helped him is an unwonted ground
    with me for self-gratulation. I think that your tenacity of
    purpose, foresight, tact, temper, discretion and patience, are
    beyond all praise, and I esteem it an honor to have been in any
    degree associated with you. Your name will loom big hereafter, for
    your movement must prosper, but mine will not survive unless some
    other kind of effort of mine saves it.

    I am exceedingly glad of what you say of the Connecticut Society.
    May it prosper abundantly!

    I thank you for your affectionate words which I return with
    interest and remain, for I trust many years of this life,

    Yours faithfully,

    WM. JAMES.

At this point, rather than in the dusty corners of the usual preface, I
wish to express my obligation to Herbert Wescott Fisher, whom I knew at
school. It was he who led me to see my need of technical training,
neglected in earlier years. To be exact, however, I must confess that I
read rather than studied rhetoric. Close application to its rules
served only to discourage me, so I but lazily skimmed the pages of the
works which he recommended. But my friend did more than direct me to
sources. He proved to be the kindly mean between the two extremes of
stranger and intimate. I was a prophet not without honor in his eyes.
Upon an embarrassing wealth of material he brought to bear his
practical knowledge of the workmanship of writing; and my drafting of
the later parts and subsequent revisions has been so improved by the
practice received under his scrupulous direction that he has had little
fault to find with them. My debt to him is almost beyond repayment.

Nothing would please me more than to express specifically my
indebtedness to many others who have assisted me in the preparation of
my work. But, aside from calling attention to the fact that physicians
connected with the State Hospital and with the private institution
referred to--the one not run for profit--exhibited rare magnanimity
(even going so far as to write letters which helped me in my work),
and, further, acknowledging anonymously (the list is too long for
explicit mention) the invaluable advice given me by psychiatrists who
have enabled me to make my work authoritative, I must be content to
indite an all-embracing acknowledgment. Therefore, and with distinct
pleasure, I wish to say that the active encouragement of casual, but
trusted acquaintances, the inspiring indifference of unconvinced
intimates, and the kindly scepticism of indulgent relatives, who,
perforce, could do naught but obey an immutable law of blood-related
minds--all these influences have conspired to render more sure the
accomplishment of my heart's desire.




XXXII


"My heart's desire" is a true phrase. Since 1900, when my own breakdown
occurred, not fewer than one million men and women in the United States
alone have for like causes had to seek treatment in institutions,
thousands of others have been treated outside of institutions, while
other thousands have received no treatment at all. Yet, to use the
words of one of our most conservative and best informed psychiatrists,
"No less than half of the enormous toll which mental disease takes from
the youth of this country can be prevented by the application, largely
in childhood, of information and practical resources now available."

Elsewhere is an account of how my plan broadened from reform to cure,
from cure to prevention--how far, with the co-operation of some of this
country's ablest specialists and most generous philanthropists, it has
been realized, nationally and internationally, through the new form of
social mechanism known as societies, committees, leagues or
associations for mental hygiene.

More fundamental, however, than any technical reform, cure, or
prevention--indeed, a condition precedent to all these--is a changed
spiritual attitude toward the insane. They are still human: they love
and hate, and have a sense of humor. The worst are usually responsive
to kindness. In not a few cases their gratitude is livelier than that
of normal men and women. Any person who has worked among the insane,
and done his duty by them, can testify to cases in point; and even
casual observers have noted the fact that the insane are oftentimes
appreciative. Consider the experience of Thackeray, as related by
himself in "Vanity Fair" (Chapter LVII). "I recollect," he writes,
"seeing, years ago, at the prison for idiots and madmen, at Bicêtre,
near Paris, a poor wretch bent down under the bondage of his
imprisonment and his personal infirmity, to whom one of our party gave
a halfpennyworth of snuff in a cornet or 'screw' of paper. The kindness
was too much ... He cried in an anguish of delight and gratitude; if
anybody gave you and me a thousand a year, or saved our lives, we could
not be so affected."

A striking exhibition of fine feeling on the part of a patient was
brought to my attention by an assistant physician whom I met while
visiting a State Hospital in Massachusetts. It seems that the woman in
question had, at her worst, caused an endless amount of annoyance by
indulging in mischievous acts which seemed to verge on malice. At that
time, therefore, no observer would have credited her with the exquisite
sensibility she so signally displayed when she had become convalescent
and was granted a parole which permitted her to walk at will about the
hospital grounds. After one of these walks, taken in the early spring,
she rushed up to my informant and, with childlike simplicity, told him
of the thrill of delight she had experienced in discovering the first
flower of the year in full bloom--a dandelion, which, with
characteristic audacity, had risked its life by braving the elements of
an uncertain season.

"Did you pick it?" asked the doctor.

"I stooped to do so," said the patient; "then I thought of the pleasure
the sight of it had given me--so I left it, hoping that someone else
would discover it and enjoy its beauty as I did."

Thus it was that a woman, while still insane, unconsciously exhibited
perhaps finer feeling than did Ruskin, Tennyson, and Patmore on an
occasion the occurrence of which is vouched for by Mr. Julian
Hawthorne. These three masters, out for a walk one chilly afternoon in
late autumn, discovered a belated violet bravely putting forth from the
shelter of a mossy stone. Not until these worthies had got down on all
fours and done ceremonious homage to the flower did they resume their
walk. Suddenly Ruskin halted and, planting his cane in the ground,
exclaimed, "I don't believe, Alfred--Coventry, I don't believe that
there are in all England three men besides ourselves who, after finding
a violet at this time of year, would have had forbearance and fine
feeling enough to refrain from plucking it."

The reader may judge whether the unconscious display of feeling by the
obscure inmate of a hospital for the insane was not finer than the
self-conscious raptures of these three men of world-wide reputation.

Is it not, then, an atrocious anomaly that the treatment often meted
out to insane persons is the very treatment which would deprive some
sane persons of their reason? Miners and shepherds who penetrate the
mountain fastnesses sometimes become mentally unbalanced as a result of
prolonged loneliness. But they usually know enough to return to
civilization when they find themselves beginning to be affected with
hallucinations. Delay means death. Contact with sane people, if not too
long postponed, means an almost immediate restoration to normality.
This is an illuminating fact. Inasmuch as patients cannot usually be
set free to absorb, as it were, sanity in the community, it is the duty
of those entrusted with their care to treat them with the utmost
tenderness and consideration.

"After all," said a psychiatrist who had devoted a long life to work
among the insane, both as an assistant physician and later as
superintendent at various private and public hospitals, "what the
insane most need is a _friend_!"

These words, spoken to me, came with a certain startling freshness. And
yet it was the sublime and healing power of this same love which
received its most signal demonstration two thousand years ago at the
hands of one who restored to reason and his home that man of Scripture
"who had his dwelling among the tombs; and no man could bind him, no,
not with chains: Because that he had been often bound with fetters and
chains, and the chains had been plucked asunder by him, and the fetters
broken in pieces; neither could any man tame him. And always, night and
day, he was in the mountains, and in the tombs, crying, and cutting
himself with stones. But when he saw Jesus afar off, he ran and
worshipped him, And cried with a loud voice, and said, What have I to
do with Thee, Jesus, Thou Son of the Most High God? I adjure Thee by
God, that Thou torment me not."

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit https://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     https://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     https://www.gutenberg.org/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     https://www.gutenberg.org/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     https://www.gutenberg.org/2/4/6/8/24689
